0,"Was this a friend you were in love with, or just a best friend?"
1,Where has she gone?
2,Oh was this something that happened because of an argument?
3,Oh ya? I don't really see how
4,I do actually hit blank walls a lot of times but i get by
5,Wait what are sweatings
6,doing good.. how about you
7,it's quite strange that you didnt imagine it
8,"And thats something you should never do, good on you. "
9,What do you mean it hasn't been easy? How close have you come to cheating? 
10,Don't be nervous. Just be prepared.
11,Yes but if you stay calm it will be ok.
12,Sounds great! So what's your major?
13,"Well pleased. You should be having brains,man!That's a tough course,i hear."
14,I am sorry to hear that. Did it happen out of the blue?
15,I am sorry to hear that. I hope it turned out to be a blessing in decise.
16,"Wow, that must be terrible, I cannot imagine, I lvoe christmas"
17,"Wow, I am sorry to hear that, I wish I could make it a better holiday for you!"
18,"I work remotely, I wish that you could do something like that as well."
19,"Sometimes in life, it is not about performance. Some people just get a shiner spoon."
20,"Thats a sweet man, I hope you acknowledged his kind gesture. "
21,Their aren't that many well rounded people in the world these days so when you see one you should always show appreciation! 
22,What happened?
23,I am sorry to hear that. I hope you find a better opportunity. Did you know why they rejected you?
24,WOW! Did it do any damage?
25,That is great. I would have been scared to death. Was it recent?
26,haha yeah that would be very bad !
27,"Oh no , sorry to hear that happened to you :("
28,What happened for you to feel that way?
29,Oh that does sound terrible. What did you guys decide to do?
30,That's very scary. I hope no one got hurt.
31,So happy everyone was fine!! Everything else can be fixed.
32,So good to hear. Might want to trim some trees lol
33,I saw that game. They won on penalty kicks!
34,It was very tense. The other game with England and Sweden was not nearly as nerve-wracking.
35,It must be so frustrating to have to answer the same thing over and over. Is she older?
36,"My aunt does the same thing! I think what she is doing is accidentally deleting texts, and she doesn't understand how to check her contacts list. What do you think is happening with your co-worker?"
37,What is the problem with the engine?
38,Sorry to hear that. I hope you find what is the problem with the engine.
39,I felt sad and depressed due to my insecurities and felt rejected from society
40,The problem is I don't think you can grew out of my specific insecurity.
41,"I'm not familiar with abseiling, but I'm glad that you felt good about it."
42,"Oh, I see. No, I've never done that."
43,Hello! I am in such a good mood since I got my new home.
44,I have a ton of backyard space that we have plans for. Camping would be a fun one.
45,I want to look in to getting a nice fire pit for the house.
46,What kind of house are you building? 
47,That sounds great. What are you most excited for? 
48,Why did you feel guilty for taking a drink?
49,"I can understand. I am not a big drinker myself, but I wouldn't feel guilty about it.  Not unless you promised someone you wouldn't drink."
50,"Oh yea I can understand that then... Well I am sure you learned your lesson, right?"
51,Yeah that sounds really sad. I am sorry for what you went through. 
52,Yeah maybe that was a good decision that you made. 
53,"wow, that was so awesome of them!"
54,I had to buy my first car and it wasn't until I was 21 that I could afford it. 
55,"That is where I am still at, I am scared I will have regrets when I get older"
56,"That is good, I am glad you have no regrets!"
57,what was the topic
58,I'm not familiar with him where is he from
59,and how did you learn about him
60,"Yes, I think that everyone does! What about you?"
61,That's too bad. Our janitor is very friendly.
62,"Is it not better you replace it with same type of statuette,at a grocery store?"
63,"The mother of your grand mother ,that means your great grand mother ! Well you can search through her archives"
64,It is very bad service. What did you do? Did you complain to the manager?
65,That would be hard to do and take courage. 
66,I could see that happening but sounds like you were super brave.
67,"Oh, my, what happened?"
68,"I live near the ocean, so I do understand how this can be. I hope you ran, very quickly."
69,I heard a story of seagulls drowning a man to death.
70,I was the same way.
71,Lol. I take away my daughters now. I guess my mom passed the torch.
72,She is 13 not at 3am
73,What promise didn't he keep?
74,Wow that sounds like a terrible friend.  I hope he had a good reason for not showing up.
75,Wow. Did he have kids?
76,Ah ok. Good you stayed committed to your wife.
77,"That is very inspiring, I'm glad you take the extra time. Do you like doing what you do?"
78,"That is awesome, thanks for taking the time to help kids grasp a new language! You deserve to be appreciated, but I'm sure they appreciate you a lot."
79,"That is heartbreaking, it's always helped me to remember that no matter what happens, you have your memories with them."
80,"Absolutely, it's a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories."
81,I'm sorry to hear that.  That must have been frustrating.
82,Hopefully you were able to get the ice cream that you wanted in the following days.
83,Oh no! Glad your dad was able to help. How did it happen?
84,That's some bad luck. I hope it wasn't too much of a hassle.
85,"Awe how sweet, I bet those are good memories"
86,I agree with that for sure. 
87,I bet! That sounds like fun.
88,What sweet memories to hold on to.
89,That's awesome! How helpful where the other people so that you could enjoy your trip?
90,Must have been super fun. How were the local people? How did they treat you?
91,That's great! Im glad that they took care of you! Have a gret day!
92,I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know what caused it?
93,I've done that to myself before. Now I always wait awhile to sleep after eating.
94,What were you afraid of? 
95,"Oh No, well glad to see you are here still! "
96,what is your job position?
97,That's very bad
98,What did you do? 
99,Ouch... Is it just for a day? Is your friend a safe driver?
100,Yes... If this makes you feel better.. I lent my car to a friend for a week and thank goodness everything was alright. 
101,"Haha my girlfriend does the same thing.  Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks, then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories.  "
102,We all deserve to treat ourselves every now and then.
103,Yeah it's really frustrating when they won't have more eople on. 
104,Exactly. Hopefully more places will get self-checkout so we can get through the line faster. 
105,"Yeah, or at least do something to correct that."
106,or hire more people maybe also
107,They don't spend money unless they absolutely have to. They get bonuses for saving money I think
108,And then what?
109,"I understand, that must suck"
110,Thats terrible... have you gotten a new phone yet? 
111,"Thats true, but I hope some good luck comes your way soon.."
112,"oh well, where did you move?"
113,wow!! wonderful isn't!! you would have been over the moon once you moved..
114,"Oh no, that's terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that."
115,I am sure that threw a wrench in your plans. How frustrating!
116,whats your favorite food? that was very nice of them
117,"oh nice, im afraid the most asian food that i like is fortune cookies"
118,That will mess you up for a few days. The only thing I don't like about going away.
119,Oh no. Hopefully everybody gets back to normal soon.
120,I only like yard work with the kids. They do most of the work and we have fun in the dirt.
121,Oh no. The shower is the plus side to all the dirt I guess. I once found a snake digging a hole to plant a flower. I quit that day.
122,Oh my gosh! I would have been so upset! Nothing is better than chocolates on a bad day.
123,That's definitely better than nothing. I hope your days have been better since!
124,Thats so special! What a beautiful moment.. How old is she? 
125,"My daughter is 1.5 years old - shes just been introduced to the water.. its always so special when our babies have their ""first"" moments. Congrats mama! "
126,Have  you thought about talking to your boss about it?
127,You should still speak to him about your concerns.
128,This is terrible. So sad to hear that. What did you do then?
129,Did she already move out?
130,What do you mean? I don't know what you are talking about.
131,Well then I guess you should have went and checked to see if anyone was hurt. I hope you called a ambulance.
132,I would have gotten out right then I believe.
133,I guess you rolled all the windows down too and held your breath
134,"Wao, that sound like a great strong realtionship you have with her, so glad to hear that!"
135,"When my first daugther was born! i saw in new life, i thought everything in the world can change, we need to be pure as kids."
136,"When i see them, i believe thiw world in which we live fill with envy and hate can be rewed"
137,Thats good that you found the keychain
138,that's very good! Always nice to find those old lost items.  
139,That is seriously the worst... waiting around all day wondering whats going on! Have you tried calling him today? 
140,"Of course right, I would try angies list or homeadvisor! They can find you a new one..."
141,Oh no. I am sure he will get caught eventually though.
142,Things you do usually come back to you . 
143,What event was taking place?
144,That's cool you were on stage for that. Were you one of the musicians?
145,Oh yeah what are you doing for your vacation? 
146,Sounds rather special to me! Out of the country or to another state? 
147,That is great. It is sweet to see them grow and learn. How old is she?
148,Funny one ha ha
149,It is so sweet. Is she able to talk?
150,That should be funny to see and hear
151,That sucks... what was he or she supposed to help you with? 
152,"Well I hope you two can talk it out, express your feelings and work it out together! Friendship is hard to come by these days... "
153,Traveling is hard work. Where did you go?
154,Wow. I have never neen that far! I have been to the Caribbean though.
155,"Thats awesome, friends really can be the best. How long have you known them? "
156,"Im glad you have such good friends in your life, it makes life easier. "
157,Omg... thats terrible! Im so sorry - Ive been through similar. Are they going to give you some sort of money upon lay off? 
158,If they have a heart or soul they will! They really should...
159,That is really cool! Did they tell you why they were giving you the bonus?
160,Well at least you get something to look forward too at work.
161,What was it. I've been too busy to notice new movies out.
162,They do put out good movies most of the time. I will try and check it out. 
163,What are they doing to cause you to think that?
164,I have heard that too. You might want to contact your local district.
165,No problem I hope everything works out
166,Happy Birthday!!!! What are you going to do for it? 
167,I hope you get lots and lots! 
168,Oh no! Bugs really creep me out!
169,what did the landlor do about it? Did you have to call an exterminator?
170,Ugh.. that seems like forever away.. can you try to get it sooner? 
171,Maybe consider looking for a new job in the meantime? Never hurts to stay ahead.. 
172,That is nice. I like going to water park. What time are you going?
173,Is it a big water park?
174,"Are you ok, you have to tell me what happened."
175,Ahh that has happened to everyone before. It is embarrassing but you will get over it.
176,Well im glad you were able to cover up.
177,Oh no. That must have been scary.
178,Wow. I would've freaked. I can't even have all of the lights out in my apartment.
179,Glad a bear didn't eat you
180,How long have you been trying to sell it for?
181,I'm sure you will sell it soon! 3 months is not such a long time
182,Did you wait a lot?
183,Ah ok Congratulation
184,Shame on them.
185,You should report him. Anonymously. You should't have to deal with that every day.
186,"Oh no, that's scary, is she okay?"
187,"That's good, I'm glad it wasn't serious."
188,What are they doing that is upsetting you?
189,Have you made a formal complaint against them yet?
190,You should report it to your local police department. Building and documenting this can help you.
191,That happens a lot. What happened next?
192,I know the feeling. I hate driving now. Everyone is looking in their phone.
193,I thnk the driving age should be raised to 21 personally
194,Please tell me that he was friendly and nothing creepy! 
195,Thank god! LOL I was like please tell me this was a positive experience... 
196,That would pretty amazing. What will you do with the winning?
197,"I think the same really. Making sure everything is paid off, having a roof over your head, etc... is what most people would want to take caer of first."
198,Good for you! Studying can be a real challenge sometimes.
199,"Awesome, that's the best way to go into exam. I'm sure you'll do great!"
200,That is great. Probably he think that you are doing a great job.
201,That is good
202,"That's awful, I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my job once as well and times got really hard. What kind of stuff are you doing to try and avoid that outcome?"
203,"Well, at the time I was holding out for a similar paying job like I had before but I could not find one and I ended up working fast food. I had to downsize my place as well."
204,HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Do you have any plans for today?
205,"That is really cool, Where did you guys on your trip?"
206,I live in Texas so that it really close to me
207,Oh no. That's not right.
208,Lol. Why didnt' you just reschedule?
209,So you said you were going out of town. That's hilarious.
210,wow! That's awesome! Did you accept the job offer?
211,"yes, i understand. sometimes you just get a gut feeling that something isn't right"
212,Bummer!!! Are you looking for a work at home job or just an outside job? 
213,I hear ya.. I hope you find one soon... wishing you all of the best! 
214,I do that all of time.
215,Lol. Poor Max. I bet sometimes dogs wished the spoke English for that very reason.
216,Shame on you. I'm telling
217,"O wow that is a long time, Are you happy with it?"
218,Im sorry to hear that sometimes people grow apart. You should try to throw a party and see who comes.
219,"congratulations! I know, it probably feels lonely. Maybe you should do a party at your house and invite all the neighbours"
220,"you can't go wrong with some grilled food :) burgers, wings, hot dogs "
221,I would have went running like forest gump - what did you do? 
222,"Going to have to burn the whole house down now, and move... LOL just joking! "
223,Oh no. Did they say why?
224,Hopefully it might be reconsidered later on.
225,Is she ok? Im glad you were close by!
226,"That is really cool of you to do, Did anyone else see it happen?"
227,That's terrible. Employers just don't value their employees sometimes.
228,"I hope so, too. Have you considered working elsewhere?"
229,Oh no... were they relaxed about it or did it cause a problem? 
230,"Well glad they didnt freak out on you, some people arent as understanding. I bet it was pricey. "
231,Why is that?
232,Well I just bought a great bathing suit that covers up all the extras but still shows a little skin and makes me feel good. Maybe that will work for you.
233,That's good to hear. Where did you get it from?
234,I gotcha. I bought mine online too. 
235,oh no sorry to hear that. I just lost mine in November. It's hard.
236,People say it gets easier. I'm still waiting for that part.
237,I hope so. Nice chatting with you.
238,I hear ya. Anyway to get a new job?
239,Got ya. What kind of work do you currently do?
240,I dont like rude people either did you tell him? 
241,Oh god.. give it a few days and then try to sort it out! 
242,Oh yeah I am sure it is.. have you talked to them about paying for it? 
243,That really sucks.. i guess all you can do is get a metal type of fence or maybe one with spikes! ( lol ) 
244,Wow! Have you been to many places?
245,"I've been in the same place. DC and then its neighbor, MD."
246,MY brothers are the same way. At least yours ginally came around.
247,two younger ones. They only call when they want something. my older sister is the same. I'm the good one.
248,Happy Birthday! Is the call from the ex a good or bad thing?
249,Exes are exes for a reason I guess lol.
250,That's not good. I know my eyes hurt when staring at the bright white screen on computers . So I change them to a darker color when possible.
251,"Haven't tried that yet, but I have heard of it. I will check it out. thanks !"
252,Nostalgia. Is there another HS nearby for the kids to go to?
253,That's pretty terrible. Thirty minutes in a day pretty much just commuting one way. School is already tough.
254,"Aw thats so nice, how did she surprise you? "
255,Cakes! yessss winning. :) 
256,Thats too bad. What happened?
257,Thats horrible. Sorry to hear.
258,Awesome! Happy Birthday to you! Where are you going? 
259,That seriously sounds like the best birthday ever... i hope you guys have an awesome time. 
260,Did you get hit my it? I bet that was scary.
261,"Im glad you are ok, How is your community."
262,Wow that's awesome. I went back at 31. Still going.
263,I am studying Criminal Justice now. Hopefully I will be done soon.
264,Did you go through a breakup recently?
265,"Happy Birthday! Well, you can order out of course. "
266,What happened to him? How are they doing?
267,"That is understanable, I would be the same way."
268,Oh man. What happened?
269,Did you end up getting a ticket?
270,That is a nice thing you are doing for her though. Maybe you could hire somebody for a few hours a week and join a gym or yoga class. 
271,Go to a walking path or park. Maybe to a dog park also. 
272,"Can't always help unfortunately. I hope the little guy made it, too!"
273,I wonder how they get all the way to the road away from the other turtles!
274,I am sorry to hear that.. is there any physical therapy that can help her? 
275,Usually moving your body helps but it depends on her situation... i would get a 2nd opinion!
276,How many hours do you have left?
277,haha not bad! where are you going on vacation?
278,"Thats great, was the result good?"
279,That's great. How happy were you?
280,Did it bite you? Are you ok?
281,Im glad you are ok. Some of those are poisonous and can kill.
282,"Wow That's amazing. You must be very proud of her.  I think coding, etc, seems very hard."
283,Very inspirational story. They make good money too.
284,That's amazing! How do you anticipate dealing with people who are afraid of needles?
285,That's good thinking. I hope you won't get too many who are afraid!
286,Thats good. Make sure you follow up.
287,That's great. Would this be a good job?
288,Good luck! I hope you'll win!
289,"Well, you never know. It's nice to think what you can do with the money though."
290,I'm so sorry to hear that. How sad for you.
291,Did he ditch you as well? And how did the girlfriend react?
292,Very nice! Where was the party?
293,That's really sweet of them. Must've been a big party.
294,Thats so terrible! :( Im really sorry... you should do something special everyday and make memories! 
295,It really doesnt.. i had to put my dog to sleep and it was extremely painful. I really hope that he can rest without pain and that you can feel better soon.. 
296,Did you tell your spouse? I really think they should know.
297,Some would consider it cheating if you did not tell them.
298,I know what you mean... but for now maybe you can just car pool around with your friend until you can get one! 
299,So you can ride in style for free. Sounds fair to me.. until you get yours! :) 
300,oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
301,"I don't. My apartment won't allow, but we are moving soon I hope to get a cat."
302,"Oh, I bet that was fun and interesting visiting another country too."
303,I like to try different types of food from other places too. Then try to make them later on.
304,That can be stressful. I hope you get the sale. What will you do afterwards?
305,Do you prefer the isolation?
306,Awesome! Where are you headed to? 
307,OMG!!!!! That sounds amazing! Its going to be epic. I hope you have a great time. 
308,That's really considerate of you. Do they need your help a lot?
309,Wow. Home selling can be tough. I hope that debt clears up real soon!
310,That's sucks. You just have to warm up to people.
311,I would be so scared to move to a new place. I commend you. It'll get better
312,What happened?!
313,Oh no. Did you end up having to leave the cart?
314,Do you usually get a live one ?
315,Just a small fake one. Some people get really into decorating. I don't really like it. 
316,That sucks..... always bad to see something like that. Did you atleast enjoy your trip? 
317,Aw thats good! Im glad you still had a good time. 
318,surprise party or intervention
319,How sweet! I hope someone throws me one one day.
320,That is exciting and scary all at the same time
321,"I could understand that, Does she know anyone at her new school?"
322,life was simple then wasnt it! very cute. 
323,I know what you mean. I miss being little myself. 
324,Oh no that is not good
325,Did you finally find it
326,That's gotta be terrible. Why did they pick him instead of you?
327,I'm sorry to hear. Will you have another chance to get promoted?
328,O im sorry to hear that! How did it happen?
329,Does he not have a chance to regain his eyesite?
330,What a beautiful memory that you will always have though... have you tried to be friends again? 
331,I get it.. but you know life really is too short.. i think you should try to reach out! Do it! :) 
332,Oh no. Guess they have finally reached that rebellious age. What did you do?
333,I have no idea what that is.
334,Oh is it and action movie.
335,What did you do with it? Did you try to kill it?
336,Thats what I would have done. Did they get it taken care of?
337,O No! Are they going to offer you any kind of package?
338,Im sorry to hear that. Maybe you should contact your HR and see what your options are
339,How is it looking? 
340,There you go! Thats awesome.. i really wish we had a garage. lol lucky!
341,OF course. Pets are family.
342,What charities do you like to give too
343,"That is a very nice thing to do, I wish I could do more to help."
344,I just put all my change in a giant bottle.
345,I hope someone turns it in soon to you.. did you lose out on money too? 
346,Yeah a real pain honestly... im sorry that happened to you. :/ 
347,Did you buy tickets or win them?
348,Yeah
349,What game did they win?
350,Really? I don't recall that at all. I remember them choking. I could be wrong.
351,That sucks. Are you ok?
352,Thats good. Did the clocks all reset?
353,"I bet that was rather fun, how fast did you get it going? "
354,"Wow! You are crazy, ha ha - i probably would have had a panic attack at 90MPH. :p"
355,Thats great.I  change my oil all the time.
356,Yes my dad taught me also.
357,Try online dating! Its actually really fun... have you tried it? 
358,Dont feel that way... theres someone out there for everyone. Give it a try. :) 
359,Were you able to get her help in time! How is she doing?
360,That is good to hear! Yeah situations like that can be really alarming.
361,Thats not right. How did you feel?
362,That's good. How did you do?
363,Im sorry to hear that. Was it from age or complications?
364,Yeah that is not good. But everyone does have a time to go you know?
365,were you afraid of the dark?
366,i slept in my mom's room because i was always afraid of the dark
367,Did she land?
368,Sweet. Did the crowd cheer?
369,Wow that is great! When are you going to start?
370,That is really great! How does that make you feel?
371,Why don't you say something?
372,That isn't nice.
373,"oh gosh, me too!! especially the clown from the movie IT"
374,i slept with a light on for a couple of night lol
375,That sounds really nice! Did you stay near the ocean?
376,I remember throwing food over and watching them catch it as a kid.
377,What did it say?
378,That is so sweet. Give him twenty dollars. 
379,I bet he would love that.
380,oh no :( maybe you should confess and i'm sure you will feel better
381,i understand. maybe next time you shouldn't cheay
382,Sorry to hear that.
383,Yes. I have lost my grandma.
384,"That is a terrible thing to happen, I'm sure..."
385,I'm happy that you are still here as well! Think of the alternative :(
386,"Nice, how was the water."
387,Thats funny. Did you get them all?
388,Mw too. I don't even llike when it's too dark inside or outside.
389,Maybe we are ghosts.
390,"I live in Texas, We really dont have to worry about them here."
391,Texas is a great place! But I can understand the need to want to be prepared.
392,How much?
393,Cool. What kind of car.
394,"That is terrible, does it smell?"
395,You should tell someone.
396,I think it's my turn to win the lottery
397,"Sure, That's sounds like a real plan. lol"
398,what did he do?
399,"yes, i can see how it can bbe annoying"
400,awww. don't tell anyone but my son is my favorite child. I have two girls also.
401,How old is your son now?
402,I love Halloween.
403,I love candy.
404,Where did you meet her?
405,Thats cool. Will you see her again?
406,I bet! It has to feel like a huge accomplishment.
407,I did not know you had a 4.0! How do your parents feel about that.
408,Nice. Did you take it?
409,Nice did you take it?
410,Good luck! Do your best. you sound well prepapred.
411,I hope you get it!
412,I'm not actually in America so I don't share the same joy as you :p
413,That's always the positive side of hitting rock bottom right?
414,That's terrible. Do you think they'll take care of it>
415,Hope you don't end up in court.
416,I think that's the usual for kids. How old is she
417,That's kind of funny though. How did she react?
418,You should never lie to them. What did you say?
419,Did your friend do something bad? Why were they looking for them
420,Nice. Which one?
421,That should be fun.
422,"oh, did you enjoy it? I love going to the beach"
423,"you miss your buddy, huh"
424,I do. Makes me angry.
425,I do not like Krystals.
426,Did he have a weapon?
427,What were you gonna do if you caught him?
428,Oh no! Were there a lot of lines you had to remember?
429,"Oh wow, thats impressive but I don't blame you for forgetting lines then since there were probably tons."
430,Wow! Have you looked to see how much it is worth? You could have some money.
431,You might want to talk to a financial adviser about it.
432,Did you find it?
433,I'm sure everyone has lost something. They're just probably glad it wasn't them.
434,That's awesome. Do you think you will get it?
435,"Yes, definitely. Do you plan on buying anything new?"
436,What did you think about?
437,glad to hear you had such a carefree childhood. do you have siblings?
438,That's terrible. Wh don't people just leave insteading of hurting their partner. I don't get it.
439,ME too. She wasn't the right one obviously. Sucks to have put in so much time though
440,I watched the first season.
441,What? It's ending? I heard he hasn't yet finished the books.
442,I agree. I love autumn.
443,I love Memphis.
444,It is a passing grade. I would be fine with it.
445,A guess an A would've been nice then since you worked so hard.
446,That's good. Preperation is the first step in having a good presentation.
447,"Fingers crossed, I hope the presentation goes well."
448,That's exciting! Cabin sounds really cozy.
449,She's a lucky lady!
450,"That's the worst, I know how that feels, I'm kind of being ghosted right now myself."
451,"Just remember that means it was most likely for the best that she did ghost you, you wouldn't want to be with someone like that anyways."
452,Awww. Do you ever go back and visit?
453,Where is rou hometown?
454,I bet you are excited... are you bringing anything over with you? 
455,Sounds yummy! Thats a good choice. Have a great time. 
456,What kind of rock would you want to be?
457,So a dwayne rock.
458,/Did you get him a teacher?
459,I would be proud of him also.
460,You? I thought I was dreaming
461,"Well, no use crying over silled milk I say."
462,"I feel your pain, that happened to me a few years ago, I ended up having to settle on a job I didn't like just to make ends meet."
463,"I hope you find a job, good luck!"
464,"I'm doing pretty alright, what about you?"
465,"Absolutely, it is one of my biggest pet peeves, especially when people accuse me of lying too."
466,"I really wish I could NOT correlate to that.  But I can.  Me and my girlfriend are going through a weird time right now where she likes to tell me how hot other guys right to my face.  It is a terrible feeling, and I know exactly what you are talking about.  If it occurs a lot more I suggest you saying something about it, better to know the truth than dwell on it everytime."
467,"Yea, recently I have been trying to decide whether or not I want to mute my girlfriend on social media or not, like not block her, just mute her.  Because it bothers me how she acts single on social media, and it confuses me as to whether she wants to be with me, or is just trying to live a different personality online.  Because she talks to me and is all lovey-dovey, then gets on social media and talks like ""I don't need anyone"" and talks about how hot guys are.  And it leaves me so stuck and with the worst anxiety."
468,Was your history test hard even after all the studying?
469,"That's good, did you end up passing then?"
470,Thats great. Where did you meet?
471,What did you eat?
472,"Oh you were? I really am not a huge sports fan, so what was so big about this?"
473,"Never once? Damn, no wonder you were so shocked by it!"
474,"Yes, when does the season start?"
475,"That's exciting, who's your favorite team?"
476,Do you regret it now that you are?
477,Why are you worried still?
478,oh no. How long has she been gone.
479,"I hope not. My friends cat left for two weeks once. she came back hungry, but she was fine."
480,well I hope your cat returns safely.
481,Can you do any work to it. I know there are a lot ideas on pinterest to perk up a place.
482,Keep on the lookout and talk to realtors. They usually hear of good places first
483,How was it?
484,Thats great. Where did you go.
485,"I worry about that too occasionally, but I just push it to the back of my mind like usual."
486,"I'm sure it won't be, most people die of old age around their friends and family in a peaceful way so just hope for that."
487,"I am, I like the Oilers, who's your favorite team?"
488,"Nice, I hope they do well this season."
489,"Oh, all kids are a little iffy, I think. Are you a teacher or do you mean your own children?"
490,Teenagers are awful! I am really looking forward to my daughter becoming a teenager....not.
491,"My mom put ""the curse"" on me. She said she hopes my daughter acted 10 times worse than I did. If that's the case, I need to start saving for boarding school, because I was awful!"
492,Good luck!
493,So is it working now? I need atransmission for an old volvo. I'm saving for a new car instead.
494,Makes sense. I don't want any more bills until my kids are in school. Daycare is very expensive.
495,of course the 13 year old hates to babysit. I can't wait until she moves out. jk
496,This was the most fun chat Ive had today. Enjoy yur day!
497,What is HELLP? I'm sorry you and your baby had to go through that.
498,That's terrible. There are so many things to be afraid of when you're pregnant!
499,I absolutely hate car issues.  Will you be getting it fixed or buying another one?
500,Did it have any warranty when you bought it?
501,Why are you alone so much in the summer?
502,Do you have friends around? Go to a bar and meet some friends!
503,Was it as you remembered it?
504,That is amazing that it was not torn down or remodeled.  They seem to throw way too many buildings away these days.
505,"I know that feeling too, at least somewhat. Seems like clear favoritism to me, but maybe I'm wrong."
506,"That type of stuff always makes me so angry, since it's so clearly favoritism and hypocrisy and they just don't care one bit."
507,"I like football, who are you talking about? what team?"
508,Oh i see! are you excited with him? do you think they can go for the super bowl?
509,I know that feeling!  Are you involved in any political or activists groups?
510,Me neither.  But I agree with your sentiment - it is a great place to live and be a part of!
511,Yes. I do not have any kids myself.
512,Yes. Grandkids would be fun.
513,oh no. Did you get rid of the evidence?
514,who's cookies were they?
515,Do you study?
516,Thats good. Where do you go?
517,Interviews can be nerve wrecking.
518,I think if you stay calm you'll do fine.
519,"Yikes, that must of been a bit scary. How did it go?"
520,That's something at least. I hope they catch him.
521,"Yeah, I have a friend who has gone through the same situation. She just wants whats best best for her kids. I hope things get better for you."
522,"It shouldn't matter what you look like, but why would you think you are fat?"
523,It doesn't mean you are fat or overweight. Everyone is different.
524,"I watch it sometimes, It can be a little slow moving for my taste."
525,"Are you from New York area. I'm a little farther south, but I do like them for sure. "
526,I hate jury duty.
527,Yes. They underpay.
528,"Yes, so are you having nice weather,or is it too dry and need some rain?"
529,"I see. Well, maybe the weather is calling for some in the near future? I like sunshine, but know we need some rain too, hope you get some soon."
530,"oh no! that's scary! The house didn't get flooded, right?"
531,i'm sorry to hear that!
532,That's actually so frustrating! No note left on your car or anything from the other driver?
533,"Sorry to hear, I really hope that it doesn't cost to much to fix that up."
534,"Oh no, that really sucks. That's awful that she wanted to end things, especially since you were really into her. I am sorry."
535,"That's really odd, and unfortunate. Thankfully there are many more girls that would match you better :) Don't lose hope!"
536,Thats sound nice. I went on vacation to Thailand last week. What did you do?
537,I know what that feels like. It must have been exciting! 
538,Acting as a 'mentor' in these situations is always fun and it makes the whole experience better!
539,"Oh no, was it an important meal?"
540,That's so sad!  What did you end up doing instead?
541,What went wrong with the pizza you were trying to make?
542,Yes airplanes make me feel queasy too. What do you do to cope with it?
543,"I am sorry to hear that. Flying is never easy, especially when you feel that stressed"
544,Who is she?
545,That is bad. Did you bought her a good present so she can forget about it?
546,That does sound scary! Were you okay?
547,"Understandable, it must have been very unexpected!"
548,"That can be a fun time, it is nice to watch kids sometimes"
549,"I love playing video games, I am sure he really enjoyed that, even I would have!"
550,"Nice, I am glad to hear about that "
551,How old is he?
552,"Wow, that's terrible. Why would he do that to you?"
553,"I'm sorry you're having to go through that, I hope you're able to sell the home for a better price."
554,That's just terrible. Some people really are ungrateful.
555,"Well, hopefully he'll learn to be a better person someday, or eventually his actions will come back to haunt him."
556,"I know that feel, my brother graduated a year ago, it's a really big milestone."
557,"Yes I agree, it really signifies the start of their next chapter in life."
558,That must have been a burden lifted for sure!
559,"That's a shame, since rain is really nice to watch and hear even disregarding the dryness over there."
560,"Very true, well hopefully you get some anyway! "
561,That's usually a sign of a lack of confidence or self esteem  in ones self I believe. 
562,I hope you he changes some so you can still be friends. 
563,that's wonderful! i've never cheated on my husband either
564,it is :( i don't know how is it possible to cheat on someone you love
565,"I am sure you can, it just takes dedication and effort is all!"
566,Then you should have no problems at all!
567,"that is so scary! you didn't get hurt, right?"
568,i'm so glad you did'nt get hurt
569,"I was also excited. In fact, I have one right now!"
570,Those are great titles. I am a big Nintendo fan. I can't wait for the new Metroid Prime.
571,That should be fun. Pokemon is a great franchise. I have many of the handheld games.
572,"I have not, I did hear that England lost recently though."
573,"I heard they were doing great before the loss though, hope you at least got to see them in some good matches."
574,"Oh no, sorry to hear that! Were you okay?"
575,I can imagine. Well atleast you can look back and laugh it off as one of 'those' days!
576,Did this make you excited?
577,What type of car was it?
578,"I am sorry to hear that, maybe things will work themselves out!"
579,"I feel bad, I hope you find someone who treats you even better!"
580,"That sounds embarrassing, what happened after?"
581,That sounds like what I would have done too
582,What a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?
583,hat a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?
584,you should let him know now.
585,"I loved my grandparents on my mother's side , so I understand how you feel. "
586,I was very close to mine. They are like parents but more fun.
587,"That is scary, what are you going to do about it?"
588,"Wow that is sad, I hope you get that fixed"
589,"That's fun, my friend is getting married next year, how big was the wedding?"
590,"Oh I see, well that's still nice!"
591,"That is very sad, did he ever get sober?"
592,"That is so great, I hope you have found some healing and closure to the difficulties it caused when you were younger. "
593,"Wow, that's quite a move. Did he say why he's staying in Samoa so long?"
594,"I can understand that. It's hard to say goodbye to a friend, I hope you can stay in contact with him."
595,"Oh man that's a bad situation. Was this vase of any sentimental value, or was it really expensive or what?"
596,"That might be a good idea, even if just to clear you conscience of the guilt."
597,"Wow that is terrible, I hope he got to live a long life before that happened."
598,"Thats terrible, at least he wasnt a puppy I guess."
599,"I can imagine you would be, wouldnt want that to happen again."
600,Crazy they wont even eat vegetables but they will eat rat poison.
601,How did  he manage to do that?
602,I mean you said he barely passed it though. Must have been slim pickings when it came to giving out the sholarships.
603,What college did he end up going to?
604,"Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career."
605,Did you get it done?
606,"Oh, nicely done, thats impressive!"
607,That is really awful. Did they take very much?
608,I bet that is a terrible feeling of betrayal. Friends should be more trustworthy. 
609,"Oh no, did it end up okay?"
610,I'm glad to hear it turned out okay.
611,"Wow, it's a wounder you did not get killed!"
612,Do you have any lasting damage? 
613,I was in a accident years ago and found glass coming out of my scalp for weeks. So I know how it is.
614,"It would have been easier to room with your brother isntead of a random roomate ,I bet."
615,"Strange they ask you to pay for college, but offer few choices."
616,"That's great! That time with the kids will really be worth it, ultimately."
617,"Yeah, it's a good thing that you have a lot of time for other more important things now."
618,"I did too, honestly. I have really improved them myself, good to hear that you have too."
619,"Although I still deal with stress occasionally, I know exactly what you mean. "
620,Why were you nervous about it? Usually drinking means to loosen up and have fun.
621,"I can see that, i had my first beer at 13 due to my brother but knew it was wrong at my age."
622,I totally understand. But I guess as a friend you also have to be happy for him and one day you will get your happiness too
623,"Remember that the universe has a perfect timing for everything. Being with someone isn't everything, be comfortable and enjoy your own company and love will come when you least expect it :) "
624,I bet so. I've never done anything like that before.
625,That is surprising. Usually these things are a popularity contest.
626,"I would not, they have to learn at some point!"
627,"I get that, but it was bound to happn at some point"
628,You must have been thrilled! There is nothing like a first car. Did you love it?
629,No way -- THAT'S the best. Paid for (I'm assuming) *and* running. Do you hope to do the same for your kids when it's time?
630,"Damn, I wish I had a car myself. What was the occasion?"
631,"Cool, 16th birthday or what?"
632,what did you do?
633,that was the right move!
634,"That's impressive, sounds like a smart young man."
635,"Sounds like it, Good for you guys!"
636,"Ahh yes,  must have been a very nice surprise! Did you play Mario on it?"
637,Well thats one way to get your kids to do household chores!
638,What athletics did you participate in?
639,Man i know that feeling. But sounds like you worked hard.
640,When did he graduate? Sounds like a really cool moment to share with him.
641,I graduated that year too! Cool to see that you were as excited as he likely was.
642,"I am very sorry to hear that, that must be terrible...."
643,"I undertand that. People are crazy like that, I never understood it"
644,"That is something I want to do when I get older, I miss the golden days!"
645,"I bet it was, to catch up after awhile, few things really compare"
646,"That's tragic, I haven't had to deal with anything like that yet."
647,"I hope so too, and I hope that you don't have to deal with anything like that anytime soon."
648,So your saying your faithful and love her.
649,Sounds like you got your priorities straight good man.
650,"Wow, go you! I am proud of you, it can be tough to do!"
651,"That is what matters, best of luck using it friend!"
652,That is an amazing thing. Being cheated on is one of the worst things that can happen when ones enters a bond like a relationship.
653,I am sure that you two will have a happy and loving life together especially if she reciprocates your desire to never cheat. 
654,"How exciting, are you from France?"
655,When did she move out there?
656,Great. How long did you stop working out?
657,It is always good to work out but start slowly since it has been a long time since your last work out.
658,Was the person one of those one people who goes like 5 miles an hour in a 65?
659,"The question is, did the woman at least do a good job ( from what you could see)?"
660,How did you respond after rejection?
661,"Yes, you hear stories all of the time about people being rejected to find out that it was a blessing in disguise"
662,"I am sorry to hear that, I hope things turn around for you soon!"
663,"I am glad to hear that, I hope they work out for you!"
664,HaHa What kind of food did they leave for you? Did you say anything to them?
665,LOL It really shouldn't be funny but for some reason you are making me laugh! I guess that will teach them to leave their lunch sitting around! haha
666,omg congratulations! Thats a great achievement and must give you so much pride and motication for the future
667,All the best for your future and your role aswell! 
668,You are right.Florida is a big state with lot's of people.
669,"The odds must be astronomical, almost like winning the lottery."
670,"I am shocked too, Croatia only has 4 millio people"
671,"Yeaah they really were, number 12 killed it with that goal "
672,"I feel that man, Parents like that care for their family a lot."
673,I am in that boat at times where i live.
674,"I know that feeling, good for you!"
675,"Yes, those are awesome feelings, I crave that all the time"
676,well he did have a right to be angry (depending on how you broke it ofc)
677,oh darn thats just abit rude and unnecessary. I hope everything is ok now 
678,"I am glad to hear that, did you repay him?"
679,"That is good to hear, I am glad it worked out well instead of a disaster"
680,sibling fights worth living for.. I wish  i had one.
681,you would know better hehe!!
682,Well happy early birthday! I hope you have a great day!
683,"I bet, I hope you get everything you want!"
684,Sorry to hear that. Do you have more firends now?
685,Great.
686,What is it about their style of play that you're not a fan of?
687,I see where you're coming from. 
688,"I'm not too familiar with Tennis, Is he known to be a winner? "
689,Wow that's neat! Crazy to hear he lost then as you said.
690,What exciting news! Did you find out ahead of time what the gender of the baby was?
691,What is 2000 yen equal to in U.S. currency?
692,"It sure sounds like it. I think healthcare in Japan is much more affordable that here in America, do you agree?"
693,"Oh, okay, well I watched a documentary about healthcare in other countries. I understand that doesn't apply here."
694,"Moms are good at doing that, aren't they?  What did she do for you?"
695,I know that feeling! What's been getting to you?
696,I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you make a speedy recovery!
697,"yes, especially if you travel a lot and for a long time. Is it for work?"
698,Where do you go the most?
699,That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries
700,Wow ! that sound's really awesome. I wish I could have gone there. But surely not for work !
701,I wish you all the best pal ! You will surely rock !
702,Maybe something in your life  makes you very stress. You should try to relax before go to sleep.
703,"You konw, sometimes consulting  a psy is a good investment. Dont be afraid to do that."
704,That sounds very sad. I am very sorry to hear you experienced that. 
705,"Huh, I see. Well good for him!"
706,"Oh, no. That's awful! Did you report something that had occurred at your job? "
707,"Yeah, that's good. It's hard to know whether to blow the whistle sometimes. It could always come back for you. I'm glad that it sounds like it worked out."
708,"Yeah, navigating those sorts of things is treacherous, but as long as you know you're doing the right thing, that's all you can do. "
709,"That can be pretty hard to swallow, do you stay in touch? It's easier these days with the likes of social media. How do you fill that void?"
710,"That's such a shame, we grieve any kind of loss, I suppose. Perhaps the wedding would bring you closer together?"
711,"I hope it works out for you, life is too short. Fill your life with wonderful things and wonderful things will surely happen."
712,I'm not actually much of a soccer fan but the hype is hard to escape! 
713,"Yes, I'm aware, but i'm a much bigger hockey fan. "
714,I stand behind him. Compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a Mexican American. 
715,How so because I want everyone in this place to be safe? You need to google immigration in other parts of the world and you will realize how awesome it is here.
716,It's sad that you have such a small mind.
717,It does happen sometimes. Has it ever occurred to you?
718,You must have felt terribly guilty when you realized! Happens to all of us
719,Brain just wants to work against you?
720,I would get that a lot in school back in the day i feel it's pretty normal to have those moments.
721,"Oh, man. That's rough. I'm sorry. Are friends helping?"
722,"Friends I know who have been through rough breakups often say that physical activity helps. That, and time. But still -- it's difficult!"
723,Holy smokes - thats unbelievable.  I gave up on playing those scratch off games
724,How often do you play?
725,Were you using it to get to a specific place?
726,I hope you were able to get it turned right back on in order to have directions to get where you were going.
727,"I am hopeful as well, but because we are human beings, I doubt that will ever happen. There will always be the same old squabbles that have occurred since the dawn of man."
728,"Yeah, sadly our world leaders are too focused on ""flexing"" instead of working towards creating a world that is sustainable and liveable for our grandchildren's children"
729,That's sad. Sorry you had to go through that.
730,I would have peed in my pants if i was there.
731,How do you feel now after so long being there?
732,That is a great feeling i bet! Good job man!
733,That must have been terrible. Were you okay?
734,I can imagine it must have been very distressing. Glad that you were OK.
735,"Yes, many. Would you like to tell me about it?"
736,Surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control.
737,That is terrible.  Were you able to do anything about it?
738,"Did you speak to a counselor, priest, or family member about it?"
739,That is terrible. Did you feel lonely?
740,How long did you stay alone?
741,That is pretty great! I am actually still a beginner with snowboarding.
742,I feel for me it's just getting to the slopes more often too.
743,True ! Conventions give you an opportunity to learn as you never know what kind of situations will prop up
744,Do you have a professional degree in first aid?
745,Texas does that to us! It helps we live in a place where air conditioning is the norm. Or do you like spending time out in the heat?
746,"I know what you mean. It's like you have to dress for both the outside *and* the inside. That's great you have a pool in which to escape, though! "
747,Oh no! Hopefully renters insurance covered it!
748,Well that is terrible for him but I am glad at least some of it is being taken care of!
749,Ugg I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes dealing with land lords is a tough business.
750,Were they fond memories?
751,That's understandable. I hope everyone you know is doing well from back then!
752,Oh wow that sounds awful! was it graphic?
753,I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
754,Sorry to hear about that. Did you ask him to move out of the house?
755,Did you know the person who was with him?
756,What song was it? Did you know it?
757,Man that is crazy! Especially that song!
758,"I consider myself somewhat knowledgable about them too, it's very fulfilling being able to help other people with their problems sometimes."
759,"Yeah, sometimes it can be annoying though because they come to you with really easy problems to fix and you feel like they should know how to do it themselves."
760,Did you take that chance and redo it?
761,I hope the email will bring you good news
762,I know that pain!  Did he keep you up watching tv or video games?
763,Because mine does the same thing... If its not video games its the TV on full blast haha! Tell him you need your beauty sleep.
764,So have you gotten to open it yet??
765,Wow! I would have told her to fill out the paperwork herself getting your hopes up like that.
766,Oh no!  Well what he didn't know won't hurt him.  Hopefully you can get a replacement.
767,Awww well I am glad he was understanding about it.
768,Thats unfortunate. It is a difficult decision to make. Sometimes we are put in those situations and they take a toll on us.
769,I hope he is in a better place now. How did you have Blackjack for?
770,"So you all had relatively all his life. Yes, it was the right thing to do. Did you get another pet instead?"
771,Wow! You must have a very trusting face! That was very nice of you to help her.
772,It definitely was! How old do you think her kids were?
773,"I almost don't want to talk about it, you know? Are you doing anything to try to move from a place of fear to one of preparation or opportunity?"
774,Good for you. And I hope you have moments of joy while you prepare for that?
775,Did you play it?
776,"That sounds so fun! I""m glad you enjoyed it!"
777,I imagine that made you feel empathetic to his plight.
778,Please tell me that you gave him some money to help him out.
779,That's unfortunate. Do you like her?
780,I am sorry. Did you set up another day to hang out?
781,What did you and your friends do on that day?
782,That does sound fun! Was the food good?
783,"Oh no, did you report it to the police?"
784,I have some hot chocolate that can help calm you down a bit.
785,No! THAT is painful! He must have felt awful! Did he have insurance to cover anything?
786,I am so sorry! But he does sound like a true friend if he's actively paying you back!
787,"That is exciting when your team wins, have you always been a hockey fan?"
788,"That is awesome! I am from Chicago, so when the cubs won the world series I felt the same way. "
789,I bet! always good when new life is born.
790,Oh that must be a handful for your parents.
791,I am sorry to hear that.I hope she gets better.
792,That is horrible news.Your family should make sure she gets comfortable on her last moments.
793,Wow I did not know that!
794,Oh no. Were you upset as well?
795,"Of course! I'm human! ;-) Beyond the disappointments, I think it's how we respond that defines us, you know?"
796,Probably even harder! Is there another fellowship you have your eye on?
797,"Oh, sending you all the best vibes! And congratulations ahead of time, Doctor!"
798,"Oh really? How did that make you feel, honestly?"
799,I can imagine. The unknown can be very scary and make you worry.
800,Oh no!  Was it a first date?  Or had you been out with this person before?
801,That's so sweet.  Do you laugh about the situation now together?
802,"That's really awesome, what makes it so complex?"
803,"Well that's really great that you were able to prepare so much, obviously you know what you're doing! Do you usually have to prep so much?"
804,Aww! That's so sweet! How long have you been married?
805,That's very exciting! Congratulations on your raise!
806,Please tell me you caught him!! That is awful!!
807,You almost gave me a heart attack with that story!!
808,That was very nice of them. Was it for a special occasion?
809,"Well, now you know they do! That was very thoughtful of them."
810,Where did you see it? 
811,"I bet, what did it look like?"
812,What made it so difficult?
813,Did you tell the teacher then we know atleast you had tried.
814,Wonderful! Your team I guess? That's exciting!
815,"It's great you give them the respect for that, your team or not! When is the Final?"
816,What is it about?
817,Sounds like you will likely do well.  Do you expect any problems with other people?
818,That's so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you. I wish I could do that.
819,"You're right, and I do all of the time. What kind of car did you get?"
820,I remember those cars! How long did it last you?
821,That is such a stressful thing to come home to!
822,I am so sorry you had to go through that!
823,Oh how nice! Did you get to visit with friends and family?
824,"I'll bet. It's always nice to visit, but it can be hard to say goodbye."
825,You still remember what you got for it?  It must have been memorable!  What was it?
826,"Oh I know that feeling!  My family was the same way, and I still remember coming home after my last day of 6th grade and seeing that same SNES box sitting on my bed."
827,"Oh wow, what time did you end up getting to bed?"
828,I know the feeling too well! Hopefully you get a good's night rest tonight. 
829,You shouldn't think about death! Take each day as it comes
830,Thinking like that seems stressful
831,Life is like that.  It is not what you know but who you know.
832,No need to kiss butt.  Maintain your integrity and enjoy life on it's terms.
833,What battle? What were you doing?
834,Is that a video game?
835,That's never fun.  Did you have any notes to help you remember?
836,That wasn't very nice of them.  It's quite common to forget things.  Hopefully next time you remember!
837,"Wow, I'm sure it will work. I've very hopeful for you."
838,"My wife and I have been together for 12 years, tried years ago and nothing. Waited a while and then started trying again and we got it. Fate has a funny way of working out."
839,That is great. With who are you going?
840,That is great.
841,Wow. What do you think will happen?
842,Well make sure you listen to your Dr.'s advice!
843,Congratulations!!! That can be both exciting and terrifying? Where are you on that spectrum? ;-)
844,I am sending you all the best vibes. Is it in a field you've worked in before?
845,"Happily, a lot of employers seem to be willing to extrapolate that if you had talents in one industry, they'd apply to another. You can always learn about different subjects; you can't always learn how to bring that special spark that customer service needs. Best of luck!"
846,I've been in that boat. What do you think the issue was?
847,That stinks. I've been interviewing also. I had two places call me back for three interviews and then no offer. So I feel ya. Just keep looking.
848,how did that go? 
849,Was it a long move? 
850,Why didn't you have any friends? 
851,What games did you play at the time?
852,"Sorry to hear that, what happened? "
853,"That's awful, people need to be more careful"
854,"Did you tell him, or did he find out?"
855,"Awe, I am sorry. In those instances, nobody wins. I hope you guys came out of it stronger than before"
856,what was the team activity? 
857,I'm happy it went well for you!
858,What is your health issue?
859,Sorry to hear that. I have same issues with my knees.
860,"Oh no, were you able to tell her you did it?"
861,"Ugh, I'm sure that was hard.  I'm sorry you had to go through that."
862,I SO agree. I would not want to live like that. And it's one thing if they're only affecting themselves -- but when it's aimed at others -- the worst.
863,Isn't that weird? I mean it takes *energy* to be that negative! Does your brother feel that too? Or just can't/won't see it?
864,How is she feeling?
865,That's terrific. Hopefully she continues to get better and better. 
866,How did that make you feel
867,Did you confront him
868,OH I am sorry to hear that. How?
869,Oh no! I hope you can fix it!
870,"I remember those days, what subject?"
871,It sounds hard! What grade did you get?
872,I have the same feeling but for the last 90s and early 2000's. Being an adult is no fun.
873,Yes or rich. When I was a kid I wanted to grow up. Now that I'm old I want to be a kid again.
874,Did you decline? I would not feel very comfortable until i got to know the family. 
875,"I agree, you made the right choice. And it gives you time to get to know the hosts before a future sleepover!"
876,"Oh, well that isn't fair of your boss! Most people wouldn't work at all while are maternity leave, he should be grateful!"
877,"Well, sounds like your boss is stressed out too much and taking it out on you! Maybe he needs a long break!"
878,Do you mean LeBron James? I was hoping he'd come to Miami!
879,I wish he would have! The Heat can use his help! Haha!
880,That must've been awesome.  I've only been to one NFL game and it was wild!
881,"I can imagine!  I remember finding out I got free tickets to Disney World one time, I was ecstatic."
882,Wow I am so sorry. That had to be so scary.  Were the cops able to find any evidence?
883,man I was hoping they would be able to help in some way!  I hope they didn't take anything to personal!
884,How sweet! How old are they now?
885,"This is true for me as well, I have a 17 and 19 years old. I can't believe it, and just turned 40 on the 5th."
886,That's..intriguing. Is there any particular reason why you're scared of the ocean?
887,Really? Same..I was about 5 in the deep end by myself.  How old were you?
888,I do not like OkCupid.
889,I prefer Tinder.
890,"I wish i was Chris Pratt but why do you wanna be ""The Pitt"""
891,"This is very true, But would you want to be bugged by people all the time."
892,I love Pokemon.
893,Cool. I liked Pokemon blue.
894,Why do you fail? Do you not study?
895,No one is smart until they learn to be smart. We are all born with brains but not smarts. We must gain smarts.
896,You can be the next trump if you work hard.
897,You have to work hard and get good at somehting.
898,I'm sorry to hear that. You two were close?
899,I did the same with mine. I lived with her during the summers and went home when school started back.
900,"Hey, it happens sometimes. What was the situation?"
901,Trust me I've been there! Some days are better than others. Did you apologize?
902,I know that must have been so disappointing!
903,Well there will always be other chances for this match up to play out again.
904,I'm sorry to hear that.  It must be difficult to be away from the one you love.
905,I'm glad to hear that.  I wish you continued love and success with your marriage.  It's a rare gift to have these days.
906,"Does he have good characteristics too, or is he just annoying all the time?"
907,Does he at least have interesting things to say when he talks?
908,Sorry to hear that.  Do you play soccer
909,Oh cool.  Maybe he was more of a hockey fan
910,How long have you been playing
911,Yeah when you break that fear from asking life gets A LOT better.
912,I am a male so it was hard at first to do that since most girls do want some assertive guys.
913,I'm sure you had a good reason. What was it about?
914,Why would you lie about that? It couldn't have been that bad? 
915,I love family reunions.
916,That's great. Where did you meet?
917,What song was it?
918,"I've never heard of it, is it from the 80's?"
919,I have a Xbox 360.
920,I love Madden.
921,Cool. What makes you so confident
922,Nice. gotta love easy credit when you put in the work
923,He is cool. I would settle for a British butler. Is he your favorite super hero?
924,"I really like Batman too, Christian Bale is my favorite Batman. "
925,So exciting! Where are you going again?
926,Whoa! That's incredible! I've never even been out of the country. Who are you going with again?
927,I agree completely.
928,The movie or Information Technology?
929,"I liked it a lot too, Can't wait for the next part of it."
930,Me too! When do you start school?
931,August as well.  What are you studying?
932,What did he do?
933,Did you try to bribe him?
934,What did he buy you?
935,I have an iphone7.
936,I've heard his net worth is like $20.9 billion dollars!!  I wish I was him too - LOL!
937,"If I were to travel to Mars, it would be with him!"
938,I can totally relate. Dogs are better than most people. What kid of dog was it?
939,"I'm sorry. Dogs take a piece of our hearts when they go. 18 years is a very long life for a dog, I bet you had a lot of great times together!"
940,"Wow, you are strong."
941,What do you eat to be so strong?
942,"That's cool.  I'm still a Boston boy...lived in Lowell, MA in 4-5th grade"
943,No I want to though.  Did you score tickets or something
944,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you stay in the capital?"
945,"Oh no! Next time, make sure you go to Mexico City! It's a blast! Besides, Cozumel isn't really that dangerous at all."
946,That's great! It's important to have confidence in yourself and your abilities at work to be successful. It's a good example to set for your coworkers too!
947,"Well, that's the most important one to make sure is happy! Good for you!"
948,I can relate - we've been in our house 18 years and have yet to do anything.  What style are you doing it in?
949,I bet you are having a blast!!!  How long do you think the renovations will take until you are done?
950,"Oh, that's terrible!! What is HELLP syndrome?"
951,"Thank goodness she was able to come, but that must have been so scary! I hope you're okay now!"
952,I've been there when a new company bought us out. How did you handle it? 
953,That sounds stressful. At least they offered severance.
954,Emotions run high - we all say things we don't mean. What happened?
955,"Honestly, you got to pick one or the other. I can see how you were frustrated, but I'm glad you realize you shouldn't have yelled."
956,Why is that? Is there something wrong with you?
957,You should work on that.Be a better version of yourself.
958,I love Donald Trump.
959,"No, he lowered my taxes."
960,My husband has that issue.  Are you shorter than average?
961,"I've heard of people trying to hang upside down for hours a day to lengthen themselves.  Not that I think it works, but apparently many people would like to be taller."
962,That isn't cool. Are you ok?
963,That is mean. Girls can be mean sometimes.
964,That's understandable was it strong? 
965,"Wow, impressive. Was it your first? "
966,really?? I could not care less.
967,I am more like a rock and roll type of guy myself.
968,Where does she work?
969,Thats cool. I went to school for marketing.
970,What score did they get?
971,Yes. I wouldn't go back.
972,He does?! So exciting! What team does he play for?
973,They are doing really well this season! You must be so proud!
974,That must have been stressful. Did you report it?
975,Are they going to accept responsibility and buy you new items? 
976,Oh man that sucks...I'd be really embarrassed
977,Sorry to here that.  Just curious are you male or female
978,I am a male.
979,I am Filipino also.
980,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that! I know how hard that can be for the family as well. Is he able to get treatments?"
981,"Well, I can't relate to some extent. My father passed away 2 years unexpectedly. It wasn't from cancer, and we actually never thought he was going to pass away that day when he went to the hospital. But, it's very hard to lose loved ones!"
982,"yes, I love new gadgets.Specially from the Apple store."
983,I remember also playing games with old and slow computers when i was a teenager.
984,Was it the summer flu? Heard that went around a lot.
985,That just sounds so bad. Glad she is better now!
986,Why? You should be happy with who you are.
987,Height you can not change but if you work hard anyone can be rich. 
988,Just work hard and make your own money. 
989,I'm sure you will. Have you been training? 
990,Do you think that's enough?
991,I'm so sorry. That must have been so painful for you. Were you close?
992,My heart hurts for you. That's such a terrible loss.
993,Is it ok?
994,I do not like salesman.
995,I don't think there is anything wrong with average. 
996,We are all average until circumstances require us to be extraordinary. 
997,I saw that movie a long time ago.
998,What was your favorite part
999,"Cool, I guess she was strong."
1000,Do you have any kids?
1001,"I do not, how about you?"
1002,"Thats cool, what kind of camera do you have?"
1003,That is an awesome achievement! Was it for high school or college?
1004,"I never played any sports in high school, I always had to work. That is a great accomplishment!"
1005,"Yikes, door guy can't catch a break. Is he ok?"
1006,"Wow, thank god he's on the up and up. I can't imagine how rough that must have been."
1007,Man I feel you.  Today was her birthday..but I thought it would be awkward to go over since she blocked me on facebook
1008,Where are you from originally.  I'm Filipino
1009,I have not and don't want to.
1010,I do like a good sandwich thou. But I eat slow.
1011,"Awe, I am sorry for your loss. Was it sudden?"
1012,I am sorry for the loss. Are you okay?
1013,Was it pretty close?
1014,Bummer.  Haven't seen it.  Don't watch soccer but I respect the sport
1015,"Wow, you are lucky you did not die."
1016,Did someone save you?
1017,Why? She seems to be nice person
1018,Oh I didn't know about that. How she is able to steal money?
1019,Hopefully it will work out.
1020,Good for you.What is the reason of all this happiness?
1021,You choose the best time.The summer is perfect for beaches.
1022,Yes. They should of won.
1023,Yes but the choked like usual.
1024,I would be as well if I were you. Are you from the area?
1025,wasn't Johnny Manziel susposed to save that team?
1026,"I'm not a big fan of them either.  Are you able to go up in buildings with an elevator, etc..?"
1027,Has it ever caused you to not be able to enjoy certain things in life?
1028,Were the results good or bad?
1029,Yes I am sure it was.
1030,aww he must be adorable.
1031,hahah how old is he?!
1032,"Oh, that is exciting. How big is your house?"
1033,"Oh, that sounds nice. What's your occupation?"
1034,Wow that's pretty bad parenting.
1035,Is it for religious reasons
1036,Hindsight and all that - do you miss her?
1037,"Perhaps she may forgive you?  It's always worth a try, sometimes you just need some time and some growth before you can revisit mistakes that have happened."
1038,What are your plans?
1039,"Wow, that sounds like a fun and interesting time, but it sounds like there are a high chance for things to go south and be a huge mess"
1040,Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. How deid it happen?
1041,Are you going to sue? You could get a whole new leg!
1042,How much would you like to lose?
1043,Sounds like a plan! You can also try to see if there is less calorie version of foods you like.
1044,I know how that can be such a struggle.  How long has it been and why did it end?
1045,"Everyone makes mistakes, we live and learn I guess.  If there is no hope of her taking you back, then you have to find a way to move forward, but take the time you need to grieve as it is a loss."
1046,Nice! Does he feel pretty confident about it
1047,Awesome! Glad it worked out for him
1048,Yes I have actually. It was scary.
1049,Im so sorry to hear that. I was watching a house for a familty member and they're safe was stolen.
1050,"I love the beach, the gulf is my favorite!"
1051,The Atlantic is not so bad!
1052,Sorry to hear that.  My grandmother is all I have left. Grandpa passed 1 month ago
1053,How old are your daughters
1054,Wow - were you nervous or scared at all?  Did the police get involved?
1055,Oh no!  Did you have to go to the hospital to get stitches or anything like that?
1056,That is fun! What was it?
1057,What a neat mystery. I bet you wish you could thank them though. 
1058,"Oh no I'm sorry about that, do you have any family that can help?"
1059,Do you have any leads on any new jobs?
1060,Oh no. Did you talk it out with them?
1061,That's nice. Everyone makes mistakes. Glad he was forgiving!
1062,That was noble
1063,"I guess when you do that well in school, you can afford to miss a day because of that every once and awhile"
1064,That is an awesome dad. Do you still have the truck?
1065,A decade is great use of it. Do you miss it?
1066,"Oh, that is SO hard. It sounds like she had a long and happy life. I'm sure you miss her so much."
1067,What kind of dog was she? 
1068,Oh no! Is she okay?
1069,That's good to hear! How long ago was that?
1070,So I take it you are a soccer fan?  It seems America is finally getting into the sport.  Do you play yourself?
1071,I would imagine so!  Argentina seems like a lovely place to live.
1072,"Oh, wao those a terrible news, is there any way to keep the house?"
1073,"Well, you have to weight your financial situation vs your emotional situation and see if it worth to keep the house, i guess you have so many memories there."
1074,ALL of y'all must have been so scared! Was she okay? Any stitches necessary?
1075,"The vomiting is scary -- so good that y'all got to the ER, and could confirm that she was okay. Was she fearful of stairs after that?"
1076,I'm glad you had someone to take care of it while you were away. Was you mother alright?
1077,Oh no. Were you able to get things sorted out? We live far away from family and I know how hard it can be especially when there are health concerns. 
1078,"Ah, congratulations! What a GREAT feeling. Are y'all all still good friends?"
1079,"You know what, nothing to mourn, really. Life has chapters, you know? It's wonderful you have the memories you do."
1080,I watched a movie based off a true story on that once. It was truely a sad story for the little girl and her parents.
1081,It was a korean movie. Don't recall the name.
1082,That's pretty sympathetic of you...but aren't you worried they'll start going through your trash
1083,Do you own any cats or dogs
1084,"Wow, I'll bet you're ready for a vacation. Are you going anywhere special?"
1085,That should be awesome. Do you know anyone in Canada?
1086,It sounds beautiful and serene.
1087,No I haven't. But now I want to see.
1088,What an amazing gift to be given!  That truly sounds like a blessing for you.
1089,For sure!  Did you accept the gift?
1090,I'm glad you and your husband communicate enough to know that!
1091,What do you say to your kids to deal with it?
1092,"Thats awesome, congratulations for sure"
1093,I am sure you are both going to be happy
1094,Wow. What a mature teacher.
1095,Was the fire related to the incident or did she get in trouble for something else?
1096,That is great! Have you been looking for a job for long?
1097,I bet it is a good feeling and are looking forward to hearing from them. 
1098,Sorry to hear about your other ones...What breed is the new one
1099,Haha nice never a dull moment I bet
1100,Was he okay with the happy meal?
1101,That's good to hear!
1102,WOW that is super scary! are you ok?
1103,Sometimes i keep a extra pir of underwear in my car for this occasion.
1104,"Me too, I haven't really found a good strategy to avoid the nervousness to be honest."
1105,"Yeah the more you think about it the more you let your expectations and imaginations put fear into you, guess we have to avoid doing that somehow."
1106,"Oh man, I accidentally eat cake all the time! It is too hard to resist. What did your mom do?"
1107,That is not too bad. What kind of cake was it?
1108,Wow. The DMV is just dreadful to go to because of stuff like that.
1109,"Yea, it would be! How faw is your DMV?"
1110,"Wow, that is awesome! Bet you were shocked and happy at the same time!"
1111,I bet! Especially with the cost of college these days!
1112,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. Was he adopted?
1113,Oh no. Poor guy. I hope he'll be happy with the man.
1114,Oh nice did you have fun? What lake?
1115,What did you guys do there today? Go swimming or fishing?
1116,The DMV really should be better by now. Did you get a chance to do anything during the wait?
1117,Wow. Just one inconveniece after another. It's no wonder people dread having to deal with the DMV.
1118,"Awesome! It seems like you really worked hard, what type of work do you do?"
1119,"Oh, yeah. I couldn't do that type of work. It is too stressful for me."
1120,"That is so hard, to feel like you've been looked over. Have you been able to have conversations with leadership as to why that might be the case?"
1121,Does that make you curious to look elsewhere? It sounds like it's maybe not the best place?
1122,Oh no.  What happened?
1123,Wow.  It had that much of an effect on you?  That it made you consider your own mortality?
1124,"Well it's good to remember your mortality, even if you have to ignore it to continue normal life."
1125,i am so sorry for you.  I know what a crushing experience the passing of a beloved pet can be.  You must be very sad.
1126,That is awful.  An unexpected illness cam really strike like a dagger in the heart.
1127,What concert?  Did you like her enough to go on a 2nd date?
1128,"Well, that sounds a bit scary!  What happened?"
1129,Did he pass away or not live close to you?
1130,"I'm so sorry, it's hard when anyone close passes on, but I think parents are one of the hardest."
1131,Why did you decide to change their education?
1132,that is an important steep you are taking in your life.
1133,How come?
1134,"That's a tough decision to make, but children do need someone at that young an age."
1135,How do you feel about that?
1136,That is a tough situation. You don't want to mess up a great friendship and you also don't want to hurt her feelings either if you don't feel the same. 
1137,Why are you jealous of Eric?
1138,"I'm sorry to hear that, I know what it's like to have your love stolen from you."
1139,If that's the case then you have a chance to find a better woman!
1140,Maybe he has no respect for you.
1141,Have you try talk to him about those issues.If he likes you he should work on the relationship.
1142,Awesome! What type of promotion? Did you get a raise too?
1143,Congrats for what store or company? Did you get a raise too?
1144,"Uhmmnnn,that could have been really emotional for you"
1145,"I understand, I've been there too,hope your getting through?"
1146,I understand that all too well
1147,My oldest only has 3 years to go and I already have dogs! I guess I'll need more
1148,Wow that really old but not too old for mummies considering.
1149,Haha yea seems like it would be really cool to see in person.
1150,What did your friend say?
1151,Did you buy him more food?
1152,That's good. It sounds like a happy ending.
1153,That must have been very frightening. Did you have somewhere safe that you went to>
1154,"What are the chances of that?! How strange, but lucky for you."
1155,What is happening on Sunday?
1156,Who are you pulling for? 
1157,It's always good to see an underdog win!
1158,What is happening in February?
1159,Good for you.You are going to have the time of your life.
1160,I'm really sorry to hear that. When did she pass away?
1161,I'm sure with time the pain will pass. Try to stay positive!
1162,Oh my! That is so scary. Thank goodness you are ok. Was it the Uber driver's fault?
1163,"Absolutely. Knock on wood, I've still never been in a car crash. Make sure you go to the doctor if you have any pain over the next couple of days."
1164,Where do you live? I live in Missouri and the snows can be brutal. We had a couple days at 0F this year. I hate it
1165,"I heard about that on the news, how it was rare to see that. I LOVE Georgia. My favorite place to visit is Savannah. I will gladly trade spots with you."
1166,My day was pretty good. I got to work from home and pack for my trip this weekend.
1167,I am going to Cali to see all of the national parks.
1168,I plan to go to both of those parks plus Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas. I have never been to Vegas.
1169,that's pretty cool.  what breed?
1170,Well you picked a great one :) Love labs.  My friend's got a big one he just attacks me with love everytime I see him
1171,That really sucks. I hate it when people spoil shows!
1172,"Sometimes you just got to binge on your own, lol!"
1173,Oh no.. that sounds awful. What happened next?
1174,That is ridiculous. No one should treat you like that when you're seeking medical help.
1175,"Oh that is scary, that happened to us a couple months ago!"
1176,"I suppose find the safest spot to bunker down, it's hard not to panic though"
1177,I completely understand. I stay home with my four kids and wouldn't have it any other way. 
1178,"Yeah, I do them all here too, they are never ending. "
1179,Yes it is :) 
1180,Interesting! Did you apprehend him?
1181,I could imagine the experience. That was a wise thing you did!
1182,"I cant actually see what you put in the prompt, but man thats crazy if it was a ferrari."
1183,"I love Ferraris, they are so expensive though, one day I hope to own one."
1184,"Me too, how does Christmas in July work?"
1185,"Maybe keep it simple, and do different things each year. Last year we went on vacation."
1186,Awesome! What are you studying?
1187,Curves are always a good thing! I was always thankful for them.
1188,Oh yeah? What's so special about it?
1189,Wow! That sounds like such a fun time
1190,Never had children as in infertile or a bad person?
1191,"Thats terrible, I hope they grow up fine, would be horrid if they didnt."
1192,"Oh no, are you ok?"
1193,"I can imagine, perhaps it's a good way to get someone to fix the steps?"
1194,I am sorry to hear about that. What happened?
1195,I hope you have been able to cope. Death is a very hard thing to overcome.
1196,"Oh no, I hope your kid wasn't too upset. Maybe need to lock the dog in another room when food is out."
1197,Well that's good they yall still had cake. I'm sure you will laugh about this in the future.
1198,Oh thats sounds fun! How much did it cost you? 
1199,Thats great. Will you be camping in the mountains or a foresty place?
1200,I bet that was really exciting!
1201,Oh wow that does sound exciting! Are you still at this university?
1202,"That is terrifying! Let me guess, they were on their phone?"
1203,"I would have been mad, too. People on their phones drive like drunk drivers. So dangerous."
1204,"I can imagine it was a great experience, not sure if I will ever have kids."
1205,Defintely and im happy you went through with it after what I would assume was a long decision.
1206,Why did you make that choice?
1207,Iv'e never heard of ballet school being so intensive. Is it something she's considering as a career?
1208,"Oh no, your cat fell out of the window?  Is it ok?"
1209,I guess what they say is true - cats do have nine lives.
1210,Did you think you did well?
1211,That's awesome! It can be nerve racking
1212,He should be there for you.
1213,The best thing you can do is get ride of him.
1214,He is not for everyone
1215,There have been a lot of those in politics.
1216,Do you get to anxious about it?
1217,You should look for a therapy that will help you with this issue.
1218,What are you feeling happy about?
1219,That's great. I'm sure you will enjoy being with them
1220,"Cheating on her? I am in a relationship and not married, and I have the thought too"
1221,"I understand that. I live by a college. All the insanely cute girls are always around at every shop, restaraunt, and bar."
1222,Sorry to hear that.  How old is he / she
1223,Yes though it's something everyone goes through...especially if he's going to be a man..I used to be the nerdy fat Asian kid who got picked on til I sucker punched the bully as hard as I could...and never got picked on again
1224,"Wow, that is quite lucky for you! I bet you made some good tips as well!"
1225,What let you on your career path to be a male stripper? Did you have a role model?
1226,I can imagine because becoming a mother was the best time in my life!
1227,"Aww, I feel like that with my kids! They're always going to be my babies"
1228,how on earth did it get stuck?
1229,"Poor thing, did it need ot be helped?"
1230,That is so sweet! Did he end up crying when he saw the puppy?
1231,I have a cat. Her name is Venus. I rescued her from outside after she was attacked by a dog.
1232,"Thank you! I am drawn to the stars and sky, and for some reason it just seemed so fitting. What was the puppy's name?"
1233,That's an adorable name. Did your brother name him?
1234,oh my! I graduate this year in a short few months. I worked really hard.
1235,I sure did. Thanks I worked extremely hard!
1236,Are you referring to the 2018 Games in Asia?
1237,"Oh, so you're a soccer fan? I don't really watch sports."
1238,Oh that's good you prepared but that's terrible timing!
1239,"It's good it ended up not being too bad, storms can be very unpredictable "
1240,That's the worst!. Mine was up extra late tonight too.
1241,I know. We just read a bedtime story where the mom paints a night scene on the child's blind to make her feel better.
1242,I hear you! I was college roommates with my sister and now we live hours apart.
1243,That is so awesome to hear. Thanks to cars and everything an hour is nothing nowadays. Especially when you can put portable DVD players in there for the kids!
1244,"Awe, I bet you felt so proud and happy for them. "
1245,"I know, they can be amazing when they are learning and exploring the world... however, I still don't think having a different colored cup than the one they wanted warrants the response they tend to give. ( I have a 2 year old and a 3 year old son)"
1246,"I agree. I am still trying to figure out why they fight so much over Blippi and Peppa pig! They are both horrible, just pick one and get it over with.  I will be miserable through both, lol"
1247,Did she jumped really high or something?
1248,tTHAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN
1249,Oh I am sorry to hear that. Are you doing okay?
1250,I am worried about you. I hope that you will have someone to talk to. 
1251,"Aw, I be so. How old is he?"
1252,"Wow, congratulations! That is such an accomplishment. He must be very bright"
1253,That is normal.We all get nervous on our fist day of work.
1254,How are you doing on that job nowadays?
1255,I think so too! I swear it was like 2012 yesterday.
1256,"That's insane. I heard that the older you are, the faster time goes by since the percentage of your life that a specific amount of time is gets shorter and shorter."
1257,Right? I didn't think about that. I miss time passing by slowly and being so excited for everything.
1258,I am sorry to hear that. Are you doing better now?
1259,I like keeping busy too. It really helps me stay sane!
1260,No way! What happened...was there a confrontation?
1261,"Oh ok. I take it, he was ""cat calling""? There are classier ways of appreciating art."
1262,"Haha. Well, who can judge art, right?"
1263,That's pretty funny. Did your sister ever find out it was you who took it?
1264,"One time my cousins dog, ruby, almost bit me for trying to put away a bowl of food. So, I understand how dogs can be with food at times haha."
1265,What would you have done in that situation?
1266,Just be glad that everyone in your class probably has no memory of it now.
1267,"Awe, I am sorry to hear that. Do you think there will be any chance of a reconciliation?"
1268,"I know it isn't my place to ask, but why did they disown you?"
1269,"In the end, I hope she sees that you were able to make it work, and if you can and do, she should meet you half way. You are very welcome :)"
1270,"Yeah, I always hate ending conversations as well 2 turns just isn't enough. I will now let you end the conversation, lol"
1271,Serious? Don't you like pizza?
1272,So bad from the vendor
1273,Haha that is terrible! Unless he was hot...
1274,"Well in his defense, it's pretty hot out."
1275,Oh really?! Is she not afraid of the dentist?
1276,Oh that's great! Sometimes it is just difficult to takes kids to the dentist.
1277,"You and the rest of the world, lol. Joking. Joking. Why are you furious?"
1278,"Yes, that was horrible what he did. I couldn't imagine what I would do if I had my child ripped from me"
1279,"Of course, hindsight is 20/20. But going forward you can live in a way that minimizes regret."
1280,It's really not for them to judge. Do what makes you happy.
1281,I know the feelings I had up until my 20's. Then I just realized how much they had no right to judge me.
1282,You should always be confident and take risks in life.
1283,Yea it reminds me of a time I took a risk on an investment. It paid off!
1284,I second that. I've been to all the parks a bunch of times.
1285,Yea my little siblings love taking pictures with them.
1286,"Work hard at it,poverty is no joke. Not an option!"
1287,"And play smart,do whatever it takes to elevate yourself. That is the attitude."
1288,That's great! You must have good credit. 
1289,"That's great, make sure to keep your utilization low if possible."
1290,In what way are you fearful? I've never thought about that before.
1291,"I am 42, 40 didn't bother me.....there is nothing you can do about the aging process. I just try to take getting older in stride."
1292,Wow... That is exciting. Congratulations! I also won my fantasy football league this year and won $300 as well.
1293,I'm sorry to hear you lost your best friend.
1294,I know the feeling. Seeing my friends kid read the books I used to read brings back great memories.
1295,Riiight. It is just so cool to see the younger generations learn and see the things that once brought us joy at one point.
1296,I still love going on planes. Makes the headaches of airports worth it.
1297,"I wish I could still sit in window seats. I'm too tall now, I can only sit on the aisle."
1298,Why do you say it like that? Is everything okay?
1299,Whoa. I'm really sorry and I really hope that's not the case. 
1300,I am so sorry to hear that. Is it related to your work?
1301,"I see. Well, this is how democracy works and we will have to accept it"
1302,Keep calm.That is the very important step you should take.
1303,You should breath deep and start focusing on the issue in hand.
1304,Ah that sounds like a good time. Hope it doesn't rain for you guys.
1305,Yea the radars are usually accurate. Cook good food for me.
1306,I hope they are good cooks.
1307,That's funny.
1308,I always have the worst luck. 
1309,Maybe. I think some people are just born with it.
1310,What did you order?
1311,Oh no! Hopefully you will get to wear them on your next trip to the beach.
1312,That is my favorite thing to do. I am sure they are glad when you are home.
1313,You definitely deserve it.
1314,Oh my goodness I bet! I am sorry to hear that you went through that.
1315,"Well that is definitely good to hear. It must be so hard to go that long as somebody's ""side kick"" and lose them."
1316,That's great you are happy with where you are in life. I think the place we work and the area in which we live make a big difference.
1317,Having a clear and defined path is important. Success comes from hardwork and dedication.
1318,I love to eat there. One of my favorite foods to eat is steak.
1319,I've never tried that but it looks pretty good. One day I have to try that.
1320,That seems bad and I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
1321,I am truly sorry to hear that. Please accept my apologies for your loss. May he rest in peace
1322,I am sorry to heard that.How long were you together.
1323,I agree with you.I was lonely for a whole year.
1324,Was it cold?
1325,I've worked in retail before. I'd be afraid to get stuck in the freezer.
1326,Why?  Is there something good going to happen on Sunday?
1327,Oh yeah!  Allez les bleus!  But good on tiny Croatia for even making it that far.  That's an incredible story for them.
1328,Nice. That's always a good feeling. 
1329,I bet. I know the feeling well since my car is also on its way out. 
1330,"It's so good you stayed loyal, I think anyone would've appreciated a friend like you."
1331,"Yeah because faithfulness is what defines a true friendship, after all."
1332,"Awe, I am sorry. What made it tough?"
1333,"I hate when bosses are like that. Is he normally like that? If so, I would sit him down and talk to him and tell him how his actions are affecting you"
1334,I agree with that. Victor mentality. 
1335,That's the spirit that got trump elected.
1336,Oh no! How disappointing. Hopefully you didn't cut yourself!
1337,Oh well at least that is a plus. 
1338,I always wondered how you start something like that up with your partner without hurting their feelings.
1339,Whatever makes you happy I guess. To each their own.
1340,How terrible! I bet your heart stopped in that moment.
1341,People seem to only care about themselves a lot.
1342,I feel you.I also get sad when i see people living of the street.
1343,There not a lot we can do.Maybe presure the local politicians 
1344,Why? Is it something with your work-life balance?
1345,You should take it easy. Just relax and cross your fingers for the best to come yet
1346,Oh no. I am so sorry. That is so hard. My daughters cat got run over like a week after we had him. :( What was your dog's name?
1347,Doodles. That's a cute name! I'm sorry about your dog. 16 Years sounds like a good long life.
1348,If it doesn't work out he can always go back.
1349,I certainly don't. I was miserable as a kid.
1350,"Yes, some worse than others. What do you miss the most?"
1351,You can always organize a reunion for your former classmates.
1352,"Ugh, I hate the waiting game. What's the job for? Have you tried calling back and checking in?"
1353,Teaching sounds good. We seriously need more amazing teachers. I'll pray that it will all work out for you. 
1354,Were you able to finish right?
1355,LOL.That was funny.The most important thing is that you build the toy.
1356,I'm sorry. We're you close?
1357,I can't imagine what that was like. I hope you find peace.
1358,Oh that's too bad. How long before they get home?
1359,Oh well hopefully it goes quick for you but at least they will have a good trip which is nice!
1360,I hope it goes okay and for you the time passes fast! 
1361,"That's so sweet!  Modern technology is amazing, right?!"
1362,Yes that's the bad part.  Was the call that way for her?
1363,Ha ha - I'm glad she didn't really notice it!
1364,It's summer now for me.
1365,"Oh, I see. I felt that way when I was waiting for school to end."
1366,Really? The world cup right?
1367,Of course. I played soccer growing up myself.
1368,This has to be a very stressful time for you. How are you holding up?
1369,I hope they s/he will view you as a valuable member of their organization and do what is necessary to make sure you are well compensated. 
1370,Ahhh.  Math.  I have certainly been there before.  I am so sorry!  Is there any way to retake it?
1371,Don't feel too bad.  I had to take college algebra 3 times before I finally passed with an A.  Sometimes you just need a good teacher.
1372,Congratulations. You finally did it. What is your occupation now?
1373,That is a very noble that you have taken. I wish you successful career with full of joy
1374,That is great to hear. I can tell your family loves you a lot!
1375,It is nice we have days to celebrate mothers and fathers. They deserve the recognition for their hard work!
1376,Oh no! Did you end up talking to your neighbor about it??
1377,Oh well that's a nice thing to do. I'm sure she forgives you because she knows you felt bad and wanted to make it right.
1378,"Wow, that is impressive. I probably couldn't have done it with a tutorial how. I would have walked around with a flashlight until someone felt sorry for me and fixed it"
1379,That still is impressive. I bet you did feel like you accomplished something
1380,"Wow,happy belated birthday,make sure you have a blast."
1381,"Nice,was what were you up to?"
1382,Are you nervous about it? I know I was when I had my first interview.
1383,The best thing to do is not worry and just remember what you want to say to the interviewer. You will do just fine!
1384,Well You can be hopeful. But i think you should  stop gambling
1385,If it is sure then you do not need luck
1386,Oh wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. Was this an all the sudden thing or has he been in poor health?
1387,It's so hard how that usually is the case. Never deserved. Is his surgery scheduled soon?
1388,"I'm really sorry. I can't imagine what you're going through. I'll be praying that he will get his lungs ASAP and that in the meantime, you'll feel at peace."
1389,You're welcome. :)
1390,"That's so sad. I just had a cat disappear, it's quite sad."
1391,We thought it might've been hunted by coyotes since we live close to the woods. Pretty crazy.
1392,Wow. They must have been very grateful to you. 
1393,Getting the full-time sounds better taking a one time bonus from him.
1394,"Oh my god, fresh cookies that you hand baked?? What did you do?"
1395,"HAHAHAHAHA  that what my niece does, I bring home two candies and she talks me into giving her one then she hides the other when i'm not looking"
1396,come on now? you are so full of yourself!Why do you say so?
1397,Sorry about that.
1398,That's so awesome. Isn't it so nice when people do nice things for each other in their communities?
1399,My community is great about that kind of thing. I'm glad you got your money back!
1400,Oh that's great! That's really nice of you. 
1401,Wow that is exciting for sure. You must have been filled with anticipation.
1402,I certainly hope he did propose and that you are still happily living.
1403,Congratulations! Good luck with your future marriage.
1404,Oh no! I hate the dentist too! I haven't been in forever. I'm sorry. You will be okay though! Hoping it all goes well. Is it hurting you?
1405,That makes total sense! Good job for thinking ahead like that!
1406,"Sure, my dad is a Cowboys fan. He misses the days of Troy Aikman and Emmett Smith!"
1407,"Yeah, I remember as a boy watching those guys. They creamed Buffalo in the Super Bowl!"
1408,Road rage is a problem I deal with too.  I have adult add and tend to be impulsive and am horrible at socializing.  I'm glad your alright and I don't blame you for getting stressed out by that.
1409,I can't believe she didn't at least apologize or wave sorry.  That's why cell phones are horrible and can cause accidents.  I'm glad your ok
1410,Have you ever spoken to someone else about it? It's always a relief to talk things out.
1411,She took care of you when you were little so it only makes sense that you'd want to return the favor. You're a good child.
1412,Oh yeah? What happened that day?
1413,Oh no! I hope everything turned out well at the end of it!
1414,I eventually threw up. Anything you have to say though?
1415,Oh well that sounds like it ended well at least. What was the fight about?
1416,"Yea I know how you feel, you just feel like you are in purgatory waiting for your demise."
1417,Yea but i mean afterwards you dont know if you passed the interview
1418,i think you have the same attitude like me. i really feel pissed off
1419,the best way is to tame it well so that it will have good manners
1420,"My same exact sentiments, it can be lonely out here."
1421,Get registered to some of these dating sites.
1422,That's awesome. What desert is it?
1423,"I don't like lemon deserts that much, but that sounds amazing."
1424,"Yea I know how you feel, I have no idea what im doing in math sometimes"
1425,"Yea I just aim to pass and pray, it can be hard sometimes, depends on the teacher"
1426,I have had way too many close calls on my finals. How did you do?
1427,Nice! Good to hear that things worked out for you in the end!
1428,Well that's pretty annoying. He should have given it to you anyway. A- is a great grade.
1429,"You probably also learned your brother is a cheapskate, haha. I hope you did end up getting that car one day!"
1430,That is very unfortunate that you put all that work in and were let down. I hope something good came out of it like another good job afterwards.
1431,That is not fair for employers to count education more than life experience.
1432,Yes! Theres nothing like the relief that comes with not having any assignments or projects due
1433,"I've never been on a cruise before, I'm too afraid of the open ocean. Where are you going to go cruising?"
1434,Oh that's too bad! Have you told him how you feel?
1435,That's frustrating! Maybe if you just keep putting your foot down he will eventually get the message. I hope he does soon!
1436,Kids are really cute at that age.  Embrace the cuteness while you still can!
1437,No I don't have any kids but I teach so I have other people's kids to fill that space in my heart.
1438,What? why would you do that.
1439,You are so bold. I can't do it.
1440,You like being surprised?
1441,"I like presents, they're surprising."
1442,"Oh, I have only had surgery once I was really scared but it was okay I was knocked out so didn't know what was happening "
1443,I watched so many youtube videos before mine its wierd when they give you the anesthesia 
1444,That is really cool. Did you find a girl you really liked?
1445,Well I hope you are able to find the perfect girl for you!
1446,Good to hear! How did it pay off?
1447,"Wow, that's quite the honor! Good work man!"
1448,What type of competition is it?  Im curious.
1449,Wow how interesting!  I really hope you do well.  I am sure you will!
1450,That is good. I am so happy for you. Where will your vacation hold 
1451,I wish to be there too. That has always been my dream place for vacation 
1452,Happy for you. Which course are you taking?
1453,Wow! you nailed it. Sound like a tough course to study
1454,That's interesting. At least you got some new storage space!
1455,Well stealing electronics can usually be harmful to the original user because information is so personally valuable so don't do it again!
1456,Really? How did you win that?
1457,That's great. What do you write about?
1458,"That is really sweet, I saw someone tweet about a baby laughing on the beach for 15 minutes today. Happy babies are fun "
1459,Yes babies are so cute but I like being able to send them home with their parents 
1460,I've always wanted to go there! What did you like most about it?
1461,"I bet! I'm guessing it must be good weather, then?"
1462,Wow! That must have been hectic. Did you have a lot of stuff?
1463,That's crazy. The silver lining to moving for me is being able to get rid of all my junk.
1464,That's great to hear! I am sure you deserved it since you put so much effort in the project.
1465,It is good your supervisor takes notice of your hard work. Nothing is more annoying than not getting recognition for effort.
1466,That is amusing to hear. I hope your kids did not cry for their candies
1467,It was wrong of course. I hope you kids would never find out that it was their parent who ate all of their candies
1468,"That sounds super fun, I love florida and orlando its quite awesome."
1469,"Yea thats fair, I could imagine if they are so near by you wouldnt care about them."
1470,That happens to me all the time because I drive a large van with a lot of extras.  It is such a pain!
1471,Maybe we both need to buy one of those chargers that you can keep in your car so you don't have to ask for a jump.
1472,"Oh damn, that's not good. What happened?"
1473,"What the heck, that's so bizarre. Sorry to hear that it didn't work out."
1474,What makes your new living facility nicer?
1475,That is awesome. Having more space is always a plus.
1476,i think that would be very unbelievable to run into someone out the country especially from school. Has that ever happened to you?
1477,wow that is awesome where you good friends with them or you just saw them in the halls alot?
1478,"Wow, thats amazing! How did ya'll initially meet?"
1479,"High school sweethearts, that's so special. Do you ever regret committing yourself to one person so soon?"
1480,Your outlook on love is really refreshing. I wish you two the best with your new futures.
1481,That is a disgrace. Some people just do not get it!
1482,That is understandable. When did this incident occur?
1483,Free? How on earth do you get free cars?
1484,He must have a rich family. I guess you don't?
1485,"Damn, hopefully she gets it then. Why is she looking for a new one?"
1486,Man that does sound a lot worse. Well good luck to her then.
1487,"Oh wow im the same, i hope she gets it, its really stressful"
1488,"yea its a really big deal if it goes through, I hope you guys succeed."
1489,That's great. Does she practice a lot?
1490,You must be very proud. I hope she's successful.
1491,I bet you were thrilled. There's nothing like a hearty sandwich to conquer one's hunger!
1492,I tend to pile my sandwich as high as I can and still fit it in my mouth. I am like the Scooby Doo of sandwich doctors.
1493,That's unfortunate to hear. It seems like everyone lost that day.
1494,I am sorry. Hopefully you can make it up to your friend.
1495,what is your exam on?
1496,o wow that sounds very tough but i'm sure you have it as long as you been reviewing the material
1497,I've been in the same predicament. My lease was coming up and I needed a deposit for a new apartment and my friend was able to help me out.
1498,I agree. If more people were compassionate like that then maybe the world wouldn't be as messed up.
1499,That is bad news and hard to deal with.
1500,I sure hope you have a wonderful next Holiday trip very soon.
1501,oh no! did you go out and examine what it is?
1502,It's interesting! What did happen next?
1503,Lol. Hope you had a good camping night!
1504,That sounds like a mixed bag of emotions.
1505,"Exactly what I was thinking. Better cherish the time that you have with him until he goes off to college, but know that he'll always appreciate you."
1506,"Oh no! That stuff is no good, did you have fun or was it more of a mistake? Haha. "
1507,"Oh yeah but we all make those mistakes as kids, it's good you've matured since then! Haha. "
1508,"That's great. My mom had three boys, so I'll be lucky to have a daughter."
1509,It was more shared with the whole family. But later my dad hired a maid.
1510,You must be really good with reading comprehension and remembering facts. Congratulations.
1511,So you've retained all of that info and recalled it from memory during the test. I was never a good history student.
1512,"This is how you deal with such people,put him off. Reprimand such bad behaviors."
1513,"You joined the group,don't complain next time lol"
1514,You are so right. Even some of the worst conditions in my home country are better than most.
1515,I agree. We need to cherish the things we do have in this world.
1516,It could've been a ghost or maybe a robber?
1517,That's awesome that you have a mace. Are you king arthur by any chance?
1518,That's great exercise. Are you a fan of sports?
1519,Deer can be pretty ridiculous. I am glad you are okay.
1520,"That's crazy, I couldn't imagine buying a car at 18. What kind of job did you have that you were able to do that?"
1521,That's a pretty great setup so soon in live. You're very fortunate.
1522,"Yeah for sure. Luck only gets you so far, the rest is up to you. "
1523,You definitley had something to be proud of. Not many 18 year olds can say they did that 
1524,Why were you mortified? I don't know too much about net neutrality.
1525,"Oh yes I am sure you did great, public speaking is a good skill too have. "
1526,Why do you have to stress so much to get black Friday sales 
1527,Okay. I think you need to find a better source of income so that you will not have to wait for black friday to get what you want 
1528,Sorry to hear that. Have you talked with your coworker or boss about it?
1529,"Well, maybe just ask for a meeting with your boss and go from there."
1530,The news can be so sad. That is horrible that that occurred!
1531,People need to step up and start helping others. I will pray too
1532,Oh! It's excellence. Hope you enjoy your next year
1533,"yeah! you're right. Once you've moved there, you started to love your city too!"
1534,"Thats awesome, i recently reconnected with my friend, its really awesome when it happens"
1535,Yea it is one of the best feelings
1536,hahah yea i have done that more than once.
1537,what flavor was the cookie?
1538,Was it someone you saw in public?
1539,Hitting kids is kind of going out of style. People do timeout more now.
1540,"Absolutely, i can't imagine being betrayed by a friend."
1541,The best virtue in life.
1542,That's great. I just built my first computer actually.
1543,"I'm not sure what a commodore is. I don't really program much either , but I'm interested. I play a ton of pc games though."
1544,Wow getting a promotion is always an awesome thing. You guys must be so happy! Will you guys be celebrating this success?
1545,"Fair enough, that is very reasonable. Maybe you guys can celebrate on the weekend when you guys don't have work."
1546,I hate when that happens.  I wish more people would be more cautious when they drive!
1547,Yes.. it is best to be a defensive driver and keep yourself as safe as possible since there are so many crazy drivers out there!
1548,That is greta. Is she really nice?
1549,"Ok, so it is early days. When is the date?"
1550,Well let me know how it all goe!
1551,That sounds crazy! What happened?
1552,That sounds like it would give me a heart attack.
1553,"I am sure that was quite a delightful experience, especially since you were not expecting to enjoy it. Was it regular tea or flavored? "
1554,"You had an invigorating tea, delicious! Would you have it again or was this a one time encounter with tea?"
1555,No I don't know my neighbor that well but my best friend lives close so she has my spare key 
1556,If you trust your neighbour it is fine
1557,"Nice, like which ones to be specific?"
1558,"I love delicious foods more so teri yaki, so yummy."
1559,I'm glad you made it out alive. I wonder what drugs they were on. Some drugs actually make you more careful.
1560,Good thing he wasn't drunk or he very well could have gotten in an accident. Alcohol really impairs motor skills.
1561,"Damn, what would you rate both of them? I know it might be a little childish but it helps me picture it haha."
1562,"Wow he really dated up this time around, lucky him I suppose."
1563,"That's really tough. I can imagine how frustrated you are. Just know that going through trials and struggling is always good for your character and you will end up that much better of a person for getting through it. You can't be too concerned with other's lives, you just have to try not to compare. "
1564,"Oh well that's too bad but their behavior is not right or fair, and they will deal with the consequences of that themselves. Forgiving them is good for you and for them. Just try your best to let go, I know it's tough- but people everywhere are way more successful then you and way less successful and you don't compare yourself to them I hope so why focus on one random guy just because he's your brother."
1565,That is good. You finally conquer it all with your patient. 
1566,"I will advice though, in some cases you have to report this to the security agencies "
1567,Sorry to hear that. Was it a difficult course?
1568,That is good if you could pass it.
1569,"I know what you mean, childhood friends are so important and treasured"
1570,"I agree, it feels great to have someone stick around for so long"
1571,Good for him! Sounds like he's a real slugger!
1572,Did they end up winning the game?
1573,Yum! I used to love Oreo Blizzards. There was a rusty hairpin in my burger from there when I was a kid. I almost swallowed it.
1574,Don't you pick out your own clothes?
1575,People care about the dumbest things.
1576,wow that is awesome are you staying at a friends house? 
1577,wow are you looking forward to seeing the coliseum ? 
1578,sorry about that. what was happening
1579,thats sad. glad you were around to help him
1580,which exam are you taking?
1581,Entrance to what?
1582,Awwww.  That is so sweet.  It is nice to see when young people are actually being nice to each other!
1583,OMG LOL.  Well maybe that wasn't so nice!  Ewwww.
1584,That is outstanding news. You must be a great parent to raise a son who got through college.
1585,Great that he finished early!
1586,"Interesting, sounds like a metal band concert I went to where people were a bit goth. Did you go?"
1587,"College was an odd time, people the same age you didn't know that well."
1588,Law seems difficult it seems..
1589,"You should  also have a sharp memory to remember, what ever you have studied.."
1590,You seem to be an avid soccer fan. Is Croatia your favorite team?
1591,"Oh I get it, that is pretty cool. I like a good underdog story. So this World cup should be very exciting!"
1592,"That is really brave of you, thanks for doing something about it"
1593,"Yea and it can be bad for infections too, scary stuff"
1594,"Oh no, were you okay?"
1595,Wow I'm glad you were okay! I'd be so scared too.
1596,"aaawwww, thats very impressive of him. it must be a lucky day for you"
1597,wow. thats good. it is good you were patient too for him to pay back
1598,Wow! that must have been the best surprise for a birthday. You are so loved.
1599,You are so lucky to have her. 
1600,That's intense. I am sorry to hear that but stay positive!
1601,I hope that it does not. Is it a bad part of town?
1602,Like from harry potter?
1603,Dumbledore is one of my favorite characters of a ll time
1604,"Woo,i wish i was there,congrats"
1605,"Yea,i love surprises,especially from loved ones"
1606,Well then avoid the stories that scare you.
1607,Well there's no reason to waste your time reading scary stories.
1608,Oh wow. so she's kind of famous it seems
1609,that's amazing. My mother was also a beauty contest winner when she was 18.
1610,Did your girlfriend cheat on you? 
1611,But most people are still faithful in their relationship 
1612,"Now, that is what happens when you are a cat lover."
1613,You are so kind. I'm never good with pets.
1614,Congratulation for the baby. Is a good or bad suprise that our grandmother is coming?
1615,I understand. It is always good to have someone that you can count on.
1616,"Oh that's frustrating, have you told them how you felt?"
1617,"Oh that's too bad, I wonder if you could find a way to politely say something so you can focus."
1618,"Oh, that's awesome. You feeling nervous about that? "
1619,What if it's opposite? 
1620,You never know these days
1621,"Oh really, what was the judge's reaction to that"
1622,I am sorry. But i hope you have learnt your lesson this way
1623,"Really, so what was your reaction then?"
1624,"Wow, that's terrifying you know"
1625,"Awww, you need to take a nap,  for you to focus and read "
1626,Are you always scared of the exam hall? 
1627,How convenient that was! My daughter would love that!
1628,I can understand that. Is it better for you this year?
1629,"ooh, sorry about that, why cant you join the"
1630,sorry to hear that. Why dont you try to make things work with your mother's relationnship
1631,"Yeah, it's true....  What happened?? "
1632,I had similar situation with my friend last year
1633,I surely feel your pain. What happened?
1634,That's not good. Sometimes it's difficult to determine what is legit and what is not. 
1635,Who is he to you?
1636,"Wow, when did you first meet him"
1637,Nice. What scholarship?
1638,That's natural. Just don't tell him lol. You'll be alright buddy.
1639,"Sorry,  what is correct"
1640,Yeah... So tell me more
1641,"Uh oh, how did they react to that"
1642,Ouch! That's too bad. I would have been cringing!
1643,"Wow, you must be very brilliant"
1644,"For them to really give you that, that means you got sharp brain"
1645,That's awesome! What type of foods did you mostly eat?
1646,Those sound like much healthier choices. Congratulations! How long did it take to achieve your goal?
1647,"Hahahaha, it's really scary to read scary stories at night.. I had that experience "
1648,"Hahaha, you thought it was a ghost right?? "
1649,I wonder what was the work you were doing so passionately?
1650,That's interesting. You must be very talented
1651,"Really,i missed that. tell me more!"
1652,I see you enjoy gambling.
1653,What's your report on?
1654,Where subject are you studying?
1655,Oh no. can you wash it?
1656,"That is worrying, you might have to throw it out?"
1657,Where were they?
1658,I'm glad you found them.
1659,"Wow, that cat must have loved that shoe, he wanted it"
1660,"That is true, especially when you don't give them attention"
1661,Has he put in a lot of effort in studying and trying to improve?
1662,Show's working hard is really important with ACT. How did you do in yours?
1663,"No way that sounds pretty extreme, did you really?"
1664,"Haha well that's cool, did it last long?"
1665,"Wow, that is a big decision. Are you well prepared for the move?"
1666,Moving can be both adventurous and a big headache. You have to make big decisions about discarding many old possessions and selling your house if you have one.
1667,"Hahahaha, what was she thinking? "
1668,It's really annoying right
1669,"She may have done something else to ""earn"" that promotion, if you know what I mean ;)"
1670,"well perhaps you can brush up on some sabotage skills lol :) get her out, get yourself back in the game. Good luck!"
1671,good guys finish last. You have to be like Trump LOL aggressive
1672,"think of it this way: It's not revenge, it's punishment"
1673,I'm so sorry to hear that. At least you enjoyed your time with her in the moment?
1674,"Well, hey. At least there's plenty more fish in the sea. Maybe the next one will be the one."
1675,"good to hear that, what is interesting"
1676,thats great. i hope they do on my side too
1677,do what?
1678,Yeah they give up.
1679,"Wooow, that's nice... You all will have fun together "
1680,Yeah for sure...  So where are they coming from?? 
1681,That's good to hear! What sort of things has he changed or started doing?
1682,How long did it take him to lose all that weight?
1683,I tried it when I was a student. It wasn't my cup of tea. How did you find it?
1684,Good. What did you think of Amsterdam? I have been there 3 or 4 times.
1685,I am from the UK so I think it's less of a culture shock for us. I remember seeing very high Americans wandering around as if tehy had over indulged.
1686,It was pretty great but it was rough at times. You?
1687,That's great to hear! Mine was mostly happy but of course there was some issues.
1688,"Yeah, I know how you feel. Not exactly the same situation, though. I was going through with an adoption, but same amount of responsibilities nonetheless. "
1689,"Well, yes and no. There's ups and downs, but you get used to the responsibilities. Just expect more stress from your wife than anything else.  "
1690,Sorry to hear that. What was the dispute about?
1691,I understand. It should have been not easy.
1692,"Wow, did he forget your address?"
1693,"Wow, that is really nice"
1694,Lies are never a good thing in a relationship. Have you had a friend who was lying to you?
1695,"That is a good place to start, I mean a relationship not built on truth is very shaky and is liable to fall apart very quickly."
1696,this is so funny.i didn't hear it anywhere.
1697,"oh really,its  sounds terrible."
1698,"Wow, cool how did that happen?"
1699,"That's nice of her, I love when teachers go out on a limb for students like that,"
1700,Oh that's very resourceful of you. Did everything go as expected?
1701,Nice! You sound like a great caretaker.
1702,"I'm sorry, I don't understand?"
1703,It's always good to expand your knowledge.
1704,Oh really? Why is that? Seems like you were aware of it
1705,"Nice, good for you my dude. Hard to get girls these days."
1706,I hate when my cat used to do that. Would this happen often?
1707,"Cats can really be such strange pets sometimes, I swear they live off of our momentary hatred for them"
1708,hi
1709,how are you
1710,I've not seen the movie
1711,"Hahaha I really love to see horror movies, but I don't usually get scared"
1712,Very true. Who has helped you out recently?
1713,How long have you known them?
1714,k then what u do that time
1715,"k good, here after becareful with them"
1716,Like bad dreams or what?
1717,"Oh that really sucks, hopefully you get that dealt with."
1718,"A mother, father and a brother. You?"
1719,Nice! Family is so important.
1720,What engineering type did you graduate in?
1721,That's good to hear. You can always keep searching for that dream job while you work.
1722,"That it is cool. There was an old game that I loved Crash Bandicoot. Recently, they did a remaster of this game."
1723,Did you try Crash Bandicoot Kart? It is the one that I liked the most. I was playing this game several hours a day with friends.
1724,That must be really annoying! What were they late to this time?
1725,"4 hours late! Totally unacceptable! But hey, at least you live near a beach."
1726,Greed consumes all. By the way who are you implying about?
1727,Totally agree. They say one thing and do another just to keep in power.
1728,"Jealousy is the root of hatred,too bad"
1729,Why will u be consumed?
1730,"That's awesome. I never won, but I got close!"
1731,That's good man there will be more trust me.
1732,Tell me about it. How long have you been job hunting for?
1733,Did you travel anywhere for your vacation?
1734,"Awww, are you always shy?? "
1735,Woow we are directly opposite of each other
1736,what does the pen symbolise
1737,would you be using the pen for anything special
1738,What field is that?
1739,That's awesome. What charity?
1740,Wow thats great. Were you delighted?
1741,I wish I could be as lucky as you. Well happy belated birthday.
1742,That's not good. Do you find yourself in that situation frequently?
1743,I suppose that works. Sorry you feel that way.
1744,"Wow, that must be very terrifying"
1745,"That is so bad, really not cool."
1746,That's not too bad. Computer science isn't easy by any standards.
1747,That's cool. I'm studying biochem at the moment.
1748,"That is true, but why the air nikes? Haven't you heard about their effect on women?"
1749,"They're known to cause erectile dysfunction? There's chemicals in the laces, dude! A conspiracy I tell you! Done by OBAMA!"
1750,Thats horrible. I mean if you have a job at least make the effort to get there on time.
1751,Sorry to hear that. I guess your boss must have been feeling the same as you were about the nanny.
1752,"Oh boy, that is a very delicate situation. Do you plan on telling her?"
1753,"I understand your fear, but it will be worse of you keep that big of a secret from her, especially if she finds out some other way."
1754,"That's good to hear, it's always great to have a good relationship with your parents!"
1755,"Yeah, unconditional love is something that is hard to come by."
1756,That's amazing! I wish I could lift that much.
1757,You'll get there in no time. I believe in you.
1758,"Ah, reminiscing can be nice sometimes though. What was the name of the song?"
1759,I remember Martin Mystery! I loved that show.
1760,"Of course, I waking up early just for it."
1761,"Oh really? That sucks, if they just asked people would usually be ok with it too."
1762,Hopefully it isnt for anything horrid like drugs.
1763,"Wow, that means you can't sleep with the light off"
1764,"Wow, fear is a bad experience"
1765,Babies are a treasure. Do you have any?
1766,My wife is 6 months pregnant.
1767,Does ghost really exist?
1768,"Wao,i dont want to see them at all"
1769,Congrats my friend. How old is he now?
1770,It only gets worst once he's in his teenage years and bringing girls home! But it's worth it in the end.
1771,What works in particular? 
1772,"I agree wholly, quite an impeccable spectrum. I read online on 4chan that da Vinci was likely an alien from the future. "
1773,I was always jealous because my brothers didn't need to work as hard after I moved away.
1774,It was funny because I was out with one of the prettiest girls ever telling her I was jealous. I shouldn't have been though.
1775,"They have done well - do you think they are unknown though? The were semi-finalists in 1998 and have had lots of good players over the years (Prosinecki, Suker, Boksic, Savicevic, Boban)"
1776,I always loved their strip when I was younger. It was the first time a team had played in checks.
1777,I hope it is not too bad. You sent it to who?
1778,What did you say to them?
1779,That sucks. Where were you supposed to be travelling to?
1780,"Wow, Jamaica would is one of the places I dream of visiting. I guess work comes first though."
1781,"Why, have you have bad experiences?"
1782,I'm sorry to hear that.
1783,What made you good children?
1784,What country were you brought up in?
1785,"Cool, whose testimony?"
1786,Are they still going on about the election?
1787,Have you tried therapy?
1788,Yes I think so. I know people who have overcome phobias and fears that way.
1789,"Awesome, where in Europe will you be visiting?"
1790,I'm jealous. It will be amazing and I think you'll have great fun there soaking up the culture and wine also I suppose.
1791,What stuff? 
1792,Who stole them? 
1793,"Yes,its really coming"
1794,"We,pray and have faith"
1795,"Well done, you must be very proud of yourself."
1796,"Well done, great job."
1797,"Yes me too,  is that because of the gifts?"
1798,"Yes it was so exiting! what about now, do you receive many presents?"
1799,"Great, it hasn't got here yet."
1800,Central.
1801,Do you honestly believe there were less crimes back then? Or were they just better concealed
1802,That's cool.  I feel like that was true in your world.  But as far as I knew the world was a living hell for colored people more so then than now...but I'm positive the news today only highlights what is convenient for corporate America
1803,I understand. Do you like Tony Montana in the movie Scarface?
1804,It is a very nice movie.
1805,Why do they terrify you that much? 
1806,"Oh. Yeah, some people don't get scared enough because they didn't turn lights off. "
1807,"Honestly,thats very true"
1808,"Thats the way he is,can u imagine,so ungodly show"
1809,"I agree, it's better to live in your own surroundings and have your own independence."
1810,I'm happy for you. You only have one life and should do what makes you happy.
1811,who doesn't? missing anything can ruin the whole trip.
1812,I think it's better to have too much than not enough though. right?
1813,"Wow, very interesting, how did you see yourself then"
1814,"I mean, how did you see yourself when you were small"
1815,I hear you. Relationships are hard. What happened?
1816,promises are very important. builds trust. Ultimatums should do the trick ;) 
1817,"Woow, are you really good in the court? "
1818,"Woow, I guess I will like to play you someday"
1819,"Ouch, that really sucks. What kind of industry do you work in? "
1820,"Ah, I can see why that would be stressful/upsetting. Well, it is good to plan ahead, but don't stress about it too much until you know for certain you are part of that 25%, the odds are still in your favour."
1821,That was rude. Maybe she didn't hear you?
1822,Lol. That's funny. Good story for when you become her boss.
1823,Why does that have to change now?
1824,"Ah okay! Makes sense, I'm sure being a parent is no joke."
1825,I always give. You never know if it's Jesus in disguise to test your heart
1826,is he still there maybe? hope so. Remember the movie Groundhog Day. It was the homeless guys last day
1827,Sweet words like what?
1828,oh. Meditating works. Unless you fall asleep and have a nightmare.
1829,"Thats lovely,i pray i will have one"
1830,"Thats so good and fun,children are the best"
1831,Yeah? How big was the tip?
1832,"That's cool. I never understood why places won't allow their workers to take tips... what business is it of the employer if you get money? Anyways, what kind of place do you work?"
1833,Cox a poor man is automatically an Angry man
1834,For sure...  I love working for my money
1835,Yes we should be grateful to our parents for how they took care of us
1836,"Yes, I think it is easier to remeber when you become a parent yourself."
1837,Wow that is so exciting !
1838,How sweet! 
1839,Good luck. Get enough sleep.
1840,Hope you ace it.
1841,Is that Tennis? 
1842,"Wow, that must've been a shock then."
1843,"Thats horrible, how could they get it wrong?"
1844,They should pay you for the time you spend on sorting it out.
1845,"Yes, I know, they lose so much time instead of solving the important problems."
1846,Yes and they seem so full of themselves while doing it.
1847,I haven't seen it 
1848,Wooow that must really be interesting 
1849,"I have a few times, my mom is really into cooking shows, so I watched them a lot growing up, and still catch a few now and then."
1850,"Yeah, Gordon can be pretty supportive too, and soft spoken, which is surprising. "
1851,"Yeah, and mostly near the end. When its the first few rounds I think he feels they haven't earned any sort of sympathy or support, since things are just starting out."
1852,some friend. Maybe he's insecure and thought you or her were flirting?
1853,well then he shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Things aren't always what they seem
1854,oh no. sorry to hear that.
1855,Pets are family. We still want them to be around no matter what.
1856,"I'm sorry, why not?"
1857,"I completely understand, I've been in that predicament and it sucks."
1858,Really bad...  Did you come last?? 
1859,Awww you need to practice more often
1860,I don't think you are alone there! What do you find so irritating about it?
1861,I know what you mean. All the people seem to be the same types - fame hungry narcissists
1862,"Sorry to hear that, what happened?"
1863,That was a hard watch. They were a strong young team and should have won but missed a few chances in the first half.
1864,Shame on you .Did you at least pass? 
1865,And you didn't get caught either?
1866,Wow that sounds like fun
1867,I completely understand
1868,"I absolutely feel the same way. It is a rare trait, but there are few people who do better on tasks on their own than as group task. "
1869,"Yes, that too. Or does not contribute as much like they should, i.e., critical thinking/participatory contributions"
1870,Hah! 
1871,OH. If he is guilty I hope he gets what's coming to him.
1872,Well done. Did you study very hard for it or are you just very smart?
1873,"Well done, good effort."
1874,"Oh no, I'm sorry, why?"
1875,"You should make sure to keep to your word to help, then."
1876,"I guess children could have that tendency, how fun"
1877,That is amaziing!
1878,Cool. Congratulations
1879,I still have two years left. I hope to have that feeling too.
1880,Oh no sounds scary.  What happened next?
1881,That goodness for that! There is nothing worse than hearing noises like that when you are alone walking.
1882,haha. Ye like its normal to them. Nasty
1883,"hey, eating dogs are normal to some! sick"
1884,"Oh, that's not good. Did he say anything? "
1885,How come? Direction of life swaying you away from your family? 
1886,oh no why?
1887,That sucks. I couldn't be without my kids. Maybe you should go to counseling.
1888,I bet you were. Who isn't?
1889,I couldn't wait to not wake up early. Then I got a job lol
1890,"I consider myself a foodie now. Im skinny, but I love food"
1891,oh noo
1892,Me too.  They really are a man or womans best friend.  Do you have dogs?
1893,I have a little pug.  She is always so pleased to see me and loyal.  Are your dogs the same?
1894,Its really devastating. But what really happened
1895,"Wow, but its your personal life"
1896,Oh yeah? When was this?
1897,"That's too bad. I actually own a ball python, she's pretty cute."
1898,is that good or bad?
1899,OH wow. That's awesome. I want to adopt too. Maybe foster.
1900,Oh? What did he or she do? 
1901,What are the payments for? 
1902,"That's great, congratulations"
1903,"Omg, i'm so sorry. I just realized my eyes focused on promotion results. I think there is a silver lining in every situation"
1904,What meal do you speak of? Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Midnight snack?
1905,"That is awful!!! What happened to the fly? Did you manage to shoo it away or end its poor, miserable life?"
1906,"Oh no, that is not cool"
1907,"I understand how you feel, such thing have happened to me before"
1908,What happened there?
1909,Are you doing okay? anything serioius?
1910,that sounds like a lot of fun 
1911,wow be safe
1912,Sorry to hear about your loss. Sometimes its better for it to be sudden rather than wait 6 months for the cancer to destroy you
1913,everything passes with time
1914,so decide wisely how it is spent :)
1915,When are you going to find out your acceptance? 
1916,"Oh, congratulations! Which college? "
1917,Oh now why is that
1918,"Wow, now you have a brother, that is good to know"
1919,"So, how cute is he?"
1920,"Hello my friend! I will gladly wish you all the luck in the world, if you would only tell me what I am wishing it for!"
1921,"Ah, I see! Do you feel prepared for the examination? Did you spend a lot of time hitting the books?"
1922,"Of  course I have, it's really hard "
1923,Was it in the morning? Did you rush home immediately? How did you manage?
1924,college changes you. Sometimes for the worse. Glad to hear about your brother
1925,probably boosted his self confidence too
1926,"Yes, I agree it's a big concern. Do you live in an area of the world directly affected?"
1927,That's really scary! I'll try to keep spreading the word for people to be more eco-conscious.
1928,How did it go?
1929,Thats good. It doesnt always work out that well.
1930,you and me both
1931,"That is good, do you like nice cars?"
1932,"I am sorry about your car trouble, good luck with that."
1933,"You must be really happy, I bet you have a beautiful wife and lots of money in the bank :)"
1934,"That is what matters, to have a supportive and lovely wife"
1935,"I understand. I have been lonely most of my life. But, it gives it back and it makes up the loneliness part. "
1936,"I have a solution for that, but I wouldn't advocate you doing it. "
1937,I can only imagine the destruction and how horrible it is to deal with that!
1938,I am very sorry to hear that. I hope for your sake that things are getting back to normal and the destruction is being taken care of.
1939,"thats great, I feel there is someone out there for everyone"
1940,"I hear you there , I have also, but now I am in the best relationship ever!!!"
1941,Oh really? Why is that? Because you don't have to deal with their antics while they're knocked out?
1942,"I can imagine. Fortunately, I don't have any kids yet, so I do not know the pain of dealing with a bunch of crazy kids! Although, it must be very rewarding."
1943,It is one the worst pains. You would think we'd keep our toes more protected
1944,Stepping on legos are just as bad. and they are my kids' favorite toys!
1945,That sounds so frightening! Was your husband helpful?
1946,"I agree! I would have been screaming, too! (And I would have been annoyed at my husband for laughing!)"
1947,"I'm so sorry, how sad.  Do you wish you had been with her to say goodbye."
1948,"Of course I can understand it, but at least she probably didn't suffer and is now in heaven."
1949,That is always nice. Were they excited to see you?
1950,That is awesome. Life can be random like that sometimes.
1951,Never. I don't remember a time when it was that cheap anywhere in the world
1952,Good memory. We all have to change with the times.
1953,I don't even take beer
1954,"Nooo,  the first time I took it,  I misbehaved"
1955,Wow you sound really prepared for something.
1956,"Oh no, is the end coming?"
1957,"I can imagine, and how did things go?"
1958,"Great, it is true that new places and situations can be exciting but scary at the same time"
1959,"Oh wow, that has to be a bucket list item for sure."
1960,"That would have been fun, maybe next year"
1961,"Wow, why did you involve your self in spilling a bowl of cereal?"
1962,That's very serious. What are you going to do about the bowl now?
1963,Cool.  guess now you can be president.
1964,I want to Secretary of Treasury. Is that still a thing?
1965,Really
1966,Network do disappoint
1967,Omg. I know exactly how you feel. I had a lump on my back but got it removed. Turned out to be just fatty tissue. Size of a tennis ball !
1968,Good deal. I think it was stress related.
1969,"Wow that's nice,  he must be very intelligent "
1970,"Awww that's nice,  just take care of them "
1971,Happy Friday indeed! yes I can't wait to finish work for today even when i am just beginning.
1972,"Yeah, I have to.  And do you have plans for the weekend?"
1973,Oh wow. Did your friend do something to upset you or something like that? Or were you just wanting some alone time?
1974,"Well everyone has their pace. Maybe the next time you go you can invite her but take more time. It's fun, either way!"
1975,Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do?
1976,I love spaghetti myself! I'm not a good cook at all though. I'm always eating out.
1977,Yeah that's very true. But it is much easier than learning to cook myself.
1978,Cool. Most people dont like training.
1979,I bet he appreciates you being nice though.
1980,That was nice of her. I like pulling surprises on people too.
1981,Hope you had a good birthday.
1982,I live in an apartment so I take mine out to the dumpster every few weeks. I feel your pain though. Growing up I had to take ours down our steep driveway every week.
1983,It is daunting. I think I still have nightmares about it. I feel dirty just thinking about it right now.
1984,"Must have been a good result.  Was it for a job, school, or for medical results?"
1985,"I am sure your family was proud of you, as well!"
1986,"I am so sorry to hear that, it must have been heartbreaking. How did your family cope?"
1987,Well that's good to hear. Possessions can be replaced but your family is all that really matters in the end!
1988,I bet that is an experience you are still trying to get used to
1989,"I see a lot of cars that do not watch out for motorcycles, be careful out there"
1990,Thats awesome. I wish everyone could go to college if they wanted
1991,yeah. if only
1992,Money issues are always hard.
1993,"Well, you should look into that"
1994,Oh no! I hope you are ok.
1995,"Things happen we cant do anything about it, I hope this accidently wont affect you in the long term"
1996,"Everything was in the end, but at first not so much."
1997,"Yeah, it was a nice learning experience."
1998,It must have been embarrassing. Hope it ended well for you.
1999,I'm happy for you.
2000,"Oh no!  Did they react by laughing, helping, or ignoring?"
2001,I can see where that would be embarrassing.  I hope your pride wasn't hurt too much... or you physically!
2002,News that big would be a shock to anyone! How did you both handle it?
2003,I'm glad you both found the courage to face it head on. Nice job!
2004,Most definitely!. Dogs are important members of a family.
2005,Indeed. My son called our dog his cousin for a little while...weird I know.
2006,"Oh, that is frustrating! I love Chinese food. What did you order?"
2007,Crab rangoon is one of my favorites. I would be bummed too. I think I know what I am having for dinner tonight.
2008,Yes! They are super fun. Have you? 
2009,I always am as well because I am not an artist by any means. 
2010,Oh no! Is everything okay now?
2011,I know that's tough. It's scary when your kids go through something like that. It never leaves you when its time to do it all over again.
2012,Thats good news! What did they do to surprise you? 
2013,"Amazing, Im happy for you. :) "
2014,Why were you struggling?
2015,I understand. It is impossible to live with only one income for family. I am happy she have an interview.
2016,Being in debt is so stressful and I'm sure that just adds to it. 
2017,I don't blame you. I have been in that position with a credit card I forgot to pay when we moved and they didn't have the correct forwarding address. Stress on top of stress. :(
2018,I would have loved to study criminal justice
2019,"I hear you. I love true crime, so I think that would be such a fun thing to study"
2020,"Oh no, what a sad and scary situation. How are they now?"
2021,I can't imagine how hard that must have been. I'm glad he is doing better!
2022,People drive more and more badly. Did you take the plate number?
2023,I understand. I am happy that nothing bad happened to you.
2024,"Oh no that's unfortunate, did you make fun of him or something?"
2025,"Oh, well sometimes we say things we don't mean. If you apologize he'll probably accept it and be fine again."
2026,"Ohh thats great news, Congratulate him on my behalf."
2027,"No one dies along, I am sure there might be a person  in this world that is made for you , this is just not the right time to meet that guy. Just wait and it will come in front you when you really need it."
2028,Yup! enjoy the life at its fullest without worring
2029,"It sounds good just reading those words, what kind was it?"
2030,"Well pizza for breakfast every once and a while won't kill you, it sounds delicious."
2031,Wow! Was it a scratcher or did you have to pick numbers?
2032,Wow. Lucky you. You should try it again.
2033,Cool! Where are you going?
2034,Wow! Have you been there before? They have an amazing culture
2035,Wait. What happened?
2036,"That's good, no? Don't you win then?"
2037,OH no. I didn't have that problem in MExico
2038,It was two years ago. I cant remember where. We stayed on the beach all day.
2039,"Nice, I don't know this sport. What are the rules?"
2040,I am happy that she is trying something. Sport is important for kids.
2041,I have always wanted to work abroad. What work are you doing there?
2042,Cool. And congrats on your future engagement!
2043,"I can see why you feel that way. Sometimes addicts aren't in full control of their decisions, though."
2044,I think you have a right to be mad over that. 
2045,wow! i would have felt some type of way to. what did you do after 
2046,yea or be there next time she makes dinner and give her tips eating raw chicken is very bad
2047,Have you tried making any?
2048,"maybe try going out to concerts or clubs or sporting events, somewhere you can find people with common interests"
2049,Oh no. Is there a lot of parking available?
2050,I agree. I had an apartment with limited parking and people that didn't live there always parked there anyway.
2051,None that I know of!  I feel you.. if I ever had a daughter I'd be overprotective and stressing
2052,Nope lock her in the basement
2053,Where can you get that kind of weather.
2054,You had me at cheap liquor
2055,That's cool.  It's good to have loyal friends
2056,What are some personality traits you both have in common
2057,That's important. There's always tomorrow though.
2058,I wish. I bought a spin bike in January and have used it once. I have to quit smoking.
2059,"This happens many times, they just don't care of us"
2060,"our siblings, leaving us all alone in a party or a club."
2061,What was the song?
2062,Is it short skir't long jacket. I love that song.
2063,Oh no that's so gross! Do you know what
2064,My landlord has the same issue. 
2065,Yes same for me just have to fix up the credit score a bit more ha.
2066,Wow that sounds pretty stressful
2067,Did he / she turn out fine without complications?
2068,Wow is that really something that happens?
2069,I don't think I believe you. 
2070,"Well, is that something you can do?"
2071,"Right, well is there any other way?"
2072,Look carefully before you sign.
2073,That's cool. Was it not like that before?
2074,My family is like that too. 
2075,He didn't bring you anything?
2076,That's strange. I always try to buy gifts for my family when I go on a trip.
2077,Ewww. I haven't done that in a while. Thankfully.
2078,They sure do. Isn't it the law?
2079,"Oh that's the worst, I try to remember to charge but it's hard to remember every time."
2080,So he's the culprit! He better start charging it or else it's revoked !
2081,What were you guys looking to buy?
2082,"I've done that more than once, I'm terrible at names"
2083,"That is interesting, what things do you do while living in America to keep your heritage alive?"
2084,"I would imagine that might be difficult, perhaps there are some online social groups you could join as well?"
2085,Just be careful not to burn it.
2086,No sauce at all? Surely you didn't mean that too?
2087,Oh no. Sorry to hear that. IS it different now?
2088,Be patient and things will fall into place. You'll be fine.
2089,OH no. Were they okay?
2090,Be careful. It could have been worse.
2091,"Well that must be exciting to have so much variety, how old are they?"
2092,"You sound like a great parent, they're lucky to have you!"
2093,Must've been a pretty vivid dream
2094,Did you grow up with dogs
2095,Family is important.
2096,I have three. They are my world. I wish we lived in the country and not the city.
2097,"oh no, that must have been terrible."
2098,"how long ago was it, were you hurt?"
2099,"well, we all do. I hope you achieve what you set out to do"
2100,"oh, well what are you looking forward too?"
2101,It was a fire warning?
2102,"Wow, what is it a big one?"
2103,That has to be disappointing. Can you change your plans?
2104,Now you have something to look forward to.
2105,"I think that's the way to go when it comes to a wedding. Use the money for your future as a couple, not for one day. But to each their own, so you were impressed?"
2106,My suggestion is to go for your favorite food rather than some fancy catered food that you don't even enjoy!
2107,"Oh no, that's terrible. Can you walk maybe with some support at least?"
2108,"I see, that's too bad but maybe there will be more marathons you can participate in in the future. "
2109,Did you get any damage?
2110,It could've been much worse. That's good.
2111,Oh no! I would have been so disgusted! And mad!
2112,That sounds awful. I hope you filed a complaint with the restaurant!  
2113,"awww, when are you planning to visit them?"
2114,"i really hope you will be able to visit them then! I know how you feel, I didn't see my parents for a couple of years"
2115,"Nice, there is not a lot of people like you"
2116,Good
2117,Did it do much damage to it?
2118,"Man, that really stinks. Any chance it was caught on video?"
2119,"Oh no, why were you fighting?"
2120,I'm glad you guys could just shrug it off. But I imagine you guys were pretty mad during to break out into a fist fight.
2121,wow nostalgic. Wish you had time machine..
2122,best phase of our life.
2123,Do you know where you're going yet?
2124,"Well, that's a nice plan. I hope you enjoy yourself."
2125,Oh no. That's a nightmare.
2126,She will be fine. 
2127,"Oh wow, is she nervous about it?"
2128,How far away has she gone?
2129,Any chance you could move too?
2130,OH no. Is everything okay now?
2131,Well at least he changed. That doesn't always happen.
2132,I hate that. It makes it really hard to want to go home.
2133,That would be good for you. Maybe you will get some good neighbors then.
2134,You weren't thinking about the surgery at all?
2135,That would freak me out too.
2136,That is bad. I hope you found a solution with him.
2137,You can sue him
2138,What song / instrument was being played
2139,Nice I love Metallica.  Was he using a loop station and a backing track or what
2140,"Wow that's pretty good, you must be a member of the thousand pound club?"
2141,"Yeah I used to be a powerlifter, but injures cut my career short unfortunately, stay healthy!"
2142,"Yes, I watch the show. That is a bit scary though but not that much."
2143,"Ohh come on its not that scary, you should watch whole season."
2144,"Haha, Ok as you wish then"
2145,Nice did you become sort of a nature girl after that experience? Or were you just traumatized haha
2146,That's pretty cool.  So I'm guessing you're more of a city gal
2147,"That's sad, maybe you were meant to be with your ex though. "
2148,"I know but I think we're meant to stay with our first loves honestly, but maybe that's too idealistic."
2149,Was it a nice one?
2150,Do you have kids?
2151,It's never to late to start new. You guys will be fine.
2152,Is it too hot to cook or do you just hate cooking?
2153,"Don't feel bad, I have those days, too. I keep boiled eggs handy for those times eating out gets too excessive. (protein)"
2154,That's a good strategy.
2155,I didn't I was a cheerleader though if you want to count that.
2156,Well at least you can find an excuse to step outside the house and mix it up!
2157,I love Call of Duty.  What's your rank
2158,What was the announcement?
2159,"Wow, congratulations! I bet you worked hard for that!"
2160,I wish you'll also move soon. anyway I'm happy for your neighbor. 
2161,"Everyone has their time, yours will come soon"
2162,What kind of laptop is it?
2163,That sounds nice. I like having a touch screen on my work computer a lot.
2164,what are you goals that you are planning?
2165,money is the goal that everyone dreams of
2166,"That's great, how many people?"
2167,"That's nice, I plan on having 10 kids."
2168,"I was caught stealing once when I was younger. It was so embarassing, never did it again."
2169,We learn from our mistakes.
2170,I didn't go until I was thirty and it wa still fun!
2171,It is a great experience. Expensive though
2172,What kind of pizza? Now you're making me hungry!
2173,"Oh man, I bet that is gonna hit the spot!"
2174,Cool. I still get excited when my kids say new words.
2175,3 and 4. The amaze me almost everyday
2176,Oh I know what you mean! It is even worse when you ask for their manager and the manager gives you a major tude!
2177,Right? They can go get a job as a garbage collector if they want to act that way!
2178,What game was it? Did you give him tips?
2179,Was he upset with you for it?
2180,Oh snap! That is not a good thing to hear about.
2181,Well probably should confront him and if he's lying get rid of him.
2182,I've always wanted a surpirse party!! Were you happy that they surprised you in this way?
2183,I always find it amazing that people never see it coming.
2184,How exciting for you. Were you surprised?
2185,Sounds like it will be a lot of hard work to attend such a school but well worth it in the end.
2186,I know! I'm going school shopping tomorrow. Its tax free weekend!
2187,No kidding. Plus I'm buying for two so double the cost this year.
2188,What about it brings back memories?
2189,That is always fun. Lots of good memories there.
2190,"Ha, many times. I once blamed my dog for breaking a friend's TV, but it was me"
2191,Was it a good reason? I can't say I've ever done that before
2192,Oh man! That must of hurt even if it didn't break.
2193,It's crazy how glass is hard to notice when it's like perfectly clean.
2194,Did you do something really fun?
2195,I know what you mean. Sometimes in can all the difference in the world to be able to just relax for a while.
2196,How did you manage that? 
2197,Oh that makes sense. I hope you found out quickly before anyone else could see. 
2198,That is great! Has he overcome an illness or heart issue? That can be serious and very scary!
2199,"Oh wow that is great, is he feeling better since showing improvement?"
2200,What happened? did you get the best surprise of your life?
2201,"So, how many people were in attendance? and what special gift did you receive?"
2202,Those kind of exams are really important. Did you study before the accident?
2203,Man that is just awful though that happened to you. What was the out come of the exam?
2204,"Wow, thats scary. Did they have a gun?"
2205,"Oh, the ole snatch and grab. Still must not have been a good feeling."
2206,Oh that doesnt sound good! What all happened?
2207,What was the case about?
2208,have they contacted the lender for a loan modification?
2209,I wish there was something I could do to help
2210,Yes I grew up with 4 brothers and they always did it to me ..haha
2211,Did he return it?
2212,Oh that is not good! I am sorry for your loss.
2213,That is a interesting way of being positive i guess.
2214,I can imagine! Why did someone give you flowers? 
2215,That is so sweet. I hope you receive more flowers in the future from your loved ones. 
2216,These children hold a very special place in your heart. It's amazing that when this happens you never knew that you could love someone so much.
2217,She will always remember the special bond that you have.
2218,Well that is good! What class is it for?
2219,Well hopefully you do well on it.
2220,i've had hundreds. I know my toilet well
2221,"Man, that's gross! I would have freaked out."
2222,How did you prepare?
2223,"Oh okay, Im unfimiliar with snow storms because I live in Florida, but I would guess it is much like preparing for a hurricane maybe/"
2224,I hope you didn't get hurt. Did people laugh at you?
2225,Was it caught on video?
2226,I sure do. I moved into a dump lol.
2227,"Yeah, it was nice. It was a dump, but it was my dump."
2228,That must have been a wonderful feeling! It must have been hard not having your friend around for awhile.
2229,She must have traveled very far. I am glad you two have reunited!
2230,What's the news? Do you have an interview?
2231,I hope you're well prepared!
2232,if they have kids I'm sure they understand. Sometimes you just can't have nice things.
2233,"Yeah, thats too bad. But, I can understand her side too. Sometimes things can't be replaced."
2234,"Oh no, what happened to your wipers?"
2235,I bet that was scary!
2236,Oh no. It's hard to get mad at them when there really isn't anything you can do about it now.
2237,Maybe a car dealership could help.
2238,Did you have a team that you were rooting for?
2239,"That's the great thing about sports, anything can happen."
2240,I love going to concerts. Who did you go see and where was the venue?
2241,I'm a huge fan of casinos! My favorite game is blackjack. What's yours?
2242,That is great. Some of the best romantic experiences are at school dances.
2243,Sounds like you had a wonderful night. I am sure she felt the same way.
2244,"Awwww, well that;s too bad. Hopefully the owner is as loving towards it as you would have been. What kind of dog was it?"
2245,Sounds like a fun dog to have! Maybe you can check out some more shelters and find a similar one?
2246,Sorry about that. Did you talk to your manager to understand why you did got selected?
2247,I hope you get it next year. Good luck.
2248,I recently got back from a trip abroad as well! Traveling is a blast. Where are you going?
2249,"Dang, now that sounds like a swell adventure. Which one are you most excited to visit?"
2250,Dogs are so much fun. It is amazing how smart they are.
2251,Little dogs are so much fun. I have a big dog and a little one.
2252,I like a lot this show. I am fan but I never read the book.
2253,I'm sorry. Did they get them all?
2254,Is it to late to plant more?
2255,"i was 22. Registering for college classes and I was freaking out so bad, they just told me to come back the next day. I didn't go back"
2256,Really? I tried to use hulu once but it wasnt for me. You going to watch it tonight? 
2257,I dont like scary either im a baby i guess 
2258,That's good! It's always nice to have friends you can rely on
2259,I wish I had that kind of relationship. I left most of that when I moved :(
2260,Oh no. I
2261,That's great. I wonder how many hikers actually keep a first aid kit?
2262,Thats wonderful.  Are you pregnant?
2263,Wow how much longer?
2264,"oh, it's good. Take your all belongings without fail. Hope you'll have good journey. "
2265,sure. Have a good trip.
2266,I hate shots for babies. Why do they have to get so many?!?!?!
2267,You can tell they are mad at you too for letting it happen. I hate ir
2268,yum sounds good whats your fav toppings? 
2269,:o uhhh oh you had to pick them off 
2270,Cool. I hope you get it. Is it a lot more pay?
2271,I've never gotten a promotion at any job. But I've never wanted more responsibility 
2272,Awesome. Are you going to s chool or your children? 
2273,Right i work from home so i feel you 
2274,Did he come through?
2275,That's great I have a couple of friends like that
2276,"That would certainly make me upset too, was it your neighbors?"
2277,"Very annoying, I would consider getting the police to pay a visit even."
2278,She probably understood.
2279,If she is a really good friend then she did. Dont worry about it.
2280,Sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you two can patch up again?
2281,"Oh, then try to keep busy yourself so you don't feel alone."
2282,That is a shame.  I hear that is happening a lot in schools today.
2283,They don't have time for all that.  They are trying to teach.
2284,Did something go wrong with the interview?
2285,"Competition is tough these days. For whatever reason, that job wasn't meant to be and you'll find your perfect fit soon."
2286,That's really annoying. Did you send it back to the kitchen?
2287,"I think you'll probably be fine but, that dosen't mean your lunch isn't ruined."
2288,Are you going to re-order from some where else?
2289,You could always just go the sushi route from now on.  You can't udner cook it.
2290,Congratulations
2291,That's great. Some people aren't so lucky. They die at a job they hate
2292,That's awesome. I hope you love it
2293,Were you able to get it off of your shoe?
2294,"Keep working at it, you'll get it all. Try ice on it to harden the gum first."
2295,Its really hot where I live.  I'm ready for it to be over.  Its 100f out side right now and very humit.
2296,I guess its different if you live where it gets cold during the winter.
2297,You continues a series on Netflix I hope and not the other thing
2298,You shouldn't have. What happened?
2299,Thats nice.  She's becoming a teenager full force!
2300,I am sure she will be fine.  We all made it through.
2301,Why were you nervous?
2302,Oh I see. How did it go?
2303,I bet you were.
2304,That just means more food for you. That sounds like a win to me.
2305,"Tell them the next time they need to get up if they want good food, too."
2306,That has been happening a lot lately.  Everyone in the US seems to be getting wet.
2307,Im so sorry you got rained out.  Do you at least get a refund?
2308,"Whoa, that's scary! Did you freak out?"
2309,"I can imagine. Did it look like a stereotypical ghost, like Casper?"
2310,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, were you close?"
2311,"Oh that's so sweet, I wish I kept in touch with my family too"
2312,Cool. Was it an all nighter?
2313,That's my kind of party.
2314,that's really good! Have you been driving distracted when you uber?
2315,"oh okay sorry, i was just a little distracted about my car accident the other day."
2316,this semi pushed us off the road I'm still a little freaked out about it
2317,Well that's nothing compared to what could have happened.
2318,Who else was in the car
2319,I'm sorry to hear that. That's awful.   How long were you together?
2320,You must not have been speeding too much!
2321,Were you nervous being pulled over? I've never been pulled over myself.
2322,"That's great, how did the interview end up going?"
2323,"That's always great, better be be over prepared. So, did you get the job offer?"
2324,Oh no! They are terrifying little dogs aren't they?
2325,"They're really loud too actually, they bark a whole lot more than other dogs"
2326,"Oh I totally hear you there. You cant just like be yourself, and not that being yourself is bad or anything"
2327,Yeah me either. Once people get to know me its fine but usually people dont like me when they first meet me. idk!
2328,You still consider them your friends after that?
2329,That's messed up.
2330,"Wow, that's absurd.. Of course it's the ONE that's impotrant."
2331,That's always so awful.. It's too bad it wasn't something you bought with a credit card and could just dispute it..
2332,"I can see why you'd be happy about it, I mean you doubled up even with it being a small amount! Where did you buy it?"
2333,"Wow, I mean everything happens for a reason.. That's great!"
2334,"oh gosh, that's horrible. i can't imagine how you feel. i would be so heartbroken"
2335,you don't deserve it! nobody deserves it
2336,it happens. i hate being late
2337,oh gosh lol that's so funny. 
2338,I am a pretty trusting person also. 
2339,"It's okay to trust, but always be cautious too."
2340,That really sucks! Have you put up any posters to help you find him?
2341,Well I hope you find him. Hopefully nothing bad happened to him.
2342,Oh yeah those lines can be super long. What did you do?
2343,Oh no that is terrible. What happened to all your things?
2344,"Oh no, that's horrible.. July is not the time for that! Do you have someone ready to come out and fix it yet?"
2345,"That's good to hear, how hot is it where you are?"
2346,"Oh man, good for you! I would have caved for sure. Pizza is my life"
2347,So true. I always eat it all. I really can't control myself so better not to even start. Good on you
2348,"Wow thats awesome, what kind of car did you get?"
2349,"That was a good choice, did you consider any other makes/models ?"
2350,Don't blame you there i remember by kid getting his first shots.  He was so upset and wouldnt stop crying.
2351,I got lucky there he was fine after we got him away from the doctors office and got him his very treat.
2352,"Yay!!! Congrats! That's so exciting, i'm really happy for you"
2353,You will! I believe in you. Just go with a flow and take one day at a time. Your baby will love you so much
2354,"You should read the instructions before you start.. You need to work off the prompts.. But hello,"
2355,"Yes. I did go to college, but I did not complete it."
2356,I hate when that happens!
2357,I'm happy for you. I have been in that situation before.
2358,"Well, even going by yourself you can always have a good time, especially with alcohol involved! Did you end up having fun?"
2359,That's when you drink more and talk to everyone around you and make a good time for yourself!
2360,Uh oh.. Definitely not where you wanna go if you don't like clowns! Were you afraid while you were there?
2361,That's terrible! Did you make it through the entire show?
2362,"Awh man, that stinks.. I never watched it before.. I'm assuming you really liked it?"
2363,Yep why is it always with the good tv shows that it happens!?
2364,Congrats! Hard work really does pay off.
2365,I can only imagine how excited you must of been when you got the promotion.
2366,"There are a bunch of people who really don't! I don't get really why people are afraid of it, though."
2367,"Yeah, I guess I can see why that would frighten some people.. Nightlights work wonders!"
2368,"Yes, I think everyone was shocked! The real question is, were you happy?"
2369,That's awesome.. Hopefully they win again in the future!
2370,Did you enjoy it?
2371,I bet that was fun and relaxing
2372,That sounds definitely terrifying! Did you figure out what it was?
2373,Hmm.. I guess it is still July so it makes SOME sense at least! Did you ever confront them?
2374,"That is great, your studying paid off."
2375,In what college did he go?
2376,"Oh, that's awesome! I am glad he made it!"
2377,I suppose I have. Why did you go to Texas?
2378,Oh no! Were you all by yourself?
2379,ohh! that is frighting. Didn't you scare?
2380,Yeah! I am glad he didn't bite you or something!
2381,Cool. Where are you going?
2382,I've been to Cozumel. It was lots of fun
2383,It is nice. School can be very exciting.
2384,Are they happy to go back to school?
2385,Why were they fun
2386,"Yeah, its not safe at all"
2387,"Yeah. I know that feeling., although I had to buy my own."
2388,I know. What kind of car was it
2389,Parents can be awesome sometimes. Do you still play baseball?
2390,Who's your favorite team?
2391,Thats a great way to start
2392,good luck going forward
2393,Why would you do that
2394,I guess we all were though
2395,I'm sorry to hear that. Losing family is always tough
2396,I recently lost my grandmother. I thought I wouldn't get through it at all.
2397,What did you get
2398,"I understand, time is important"
2399,That's awesome. Was he the first in your family?
2400,Did he get a god job?
2401,"Wao, how did you felt? did you work hard in that project?"
2402,IWhat was your project about? it was for school or something?
2403,Where did you guys go?
2404,That's cool! I thought they'd only be around for Halloween.
2405,I hope you get it also! What type of position is it?
2406,That's great! how soon until you hear back?
2407,Well ... I put myself in your place and I admire you because it is something very emotionally tense
2408,Now you must take the corrective so that it does not happen to you anymore
2409,Oh no. What happened?!
2410,I haven't tried uber for important places. Not I know to be weary. So sorry to hear that.
2411,Oh no. Did you lose your job then?
2412,Maybe they can put you in a different department.
2413,Oh wow. Are you a parent?
2414,You must be proud.
2415,That's great!
2416,That is a real blessing. Being debt free is gonna be sweet!
2417,"I'm glad to hear that. If you can get through that, you can get through anything together."
2418,What matters is that you both learned from it.
2419,Oh wow. That is not something you hear everyday!
2420,Your friend must really like the woman. 
2421,I'm sure you are going to miss her.
2422,Will you be able to communicate through social media?
2423,What situation?
2424,Oh wow. Kid is crazy!
2425,"Oh man, that must be a horrible feeling."
2426,There is always next year champ. Im sure you'll try harder next time.
2427,That's so bad. You must be feeling bad
2428,I am surprised at their behavior. Did you ask for a refund?
2429,That is quite an achievement! How did you do it?
2430,I bet their were struggles and you learned a lot. Do you have any tips for me?
2431,That's exciting! How old is she?
2432,Oh my god. She's so little. I hope she'll enjoy it.
2433,"Oh no, that's awful. When did this happen?"
2434,"I hope the worst didn't happen to them, that's so sad."
2435,Wow that's really nice. Are you going to wear it?
2436,It must've been a great guy.
2437,Wow nice! What are you going to do with it?
2438,It is a lot of money. Take your time deciding on what to do with it.
2439,That's good news.  Is her cat microchipped?
2440,How long has the cat been missing?
2441,I bet that was scary! Did you like it?
2442,Were you ever scared? 
2443,Are you ok?
2444,Is your vehicle damaged?
2445,Did you try to find who it belonged to?
2446,"I understand, I hope you do something special with it then! It's always exciting to get a little extra cash, even only $20."
2447,Oh no! Are they even allowed to do that?
2448,That really sucks. I hate how employers expect us to work to death.
2449,Oh wow. Glad that person helped you out there. 
2450,Glad to hear there's still some good people out there.
2451,"Was that difficult? And is it your extended family, or your immediate family?"
2452,"I know that can be really tough. Sometimes, though, it can strengthen communication -- hopefully they've been able to visit?"
2453,That sounds kind of suspicious.
2454,Oh no. Did anything happen?
2455,How do you respond to the girls who are hitting on you?
2456,Seems like you might be enjoying the attention.
2457,That's definitely concern. Is there no more room for advancement at  your current job?
2458,"I hate to say it but, I think that ship has sailed.  She's either dead or not your girlfriend anymore. "
2459,"Women, amirite? "
2460,Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that and glad people at your church are there for you.
2461,hahaha must be some really great cookers. How many kids do you have?
2462,That is so tough. I always feel bad when people have a hard time conceiving because it was so easy for me.
2463,I have 4 kids. I wish you all the best of luck and will pray for you. Kids are so much fun. Mine are all almost grown now.
2464,That sounds very exciting -- if nervewracking! How did it go for him? (And you ;-))
2465,That is the *best* feeling seeing hard work pay off! You much have been so happy for and proud of him!
2466,Oh no what kind of damage was done?
2467,Did you tell her? She may want you to go ahead and get it fixed.
2468,Must've felt really nostalgic.
2469,Do you get to see your mom often?
2470,"That sucks.  If it makes you feel even slightly better,  the dumbest, most imcompent coworker I have makes more than me... because you know.. nepotism."
2471,"Yeah, its infuriating."
2472,Oh no. I'm so sorry.
2473,"I hope time will heal, and they don't lose hope."
2474,Why did you cheat on her? 
2475,"Sometimes, it feels good to get revenge"
2476,How did you get the raise?
2477,What did you do that got you the promotion? 
2478,thats great it always nice to be encourage.  Really like it when my co workers do it
2479,glad to hear it.
2480,you are such a nice person.  Hopefully you helped.
2481,That is a bummer.  On the bright side you probably won't do that again!
2482,That is awesome!  It is nice to know people can be fair!
2483,"Sounds terrible, how did she get in the accident?"
2484,What did she say after waking up?
2485,that's awkward where was it?
2486,from what you have told i cant go there what else did you see 
2487,Are you sick? What happened?
2488,That's terrible. I hope you get some rest.
2489,That sounds like a happy homecoming! Or was it bittersweet?
2490,"That's a great feeling. Knowing you *can* go home again ;-) Hopefully they can come visit you, too!"
2491,Oh that's nice! Most people don't adopt older dogs
2492,"Mostly medical. But, also that you most likely won't have long to make a bond, play, etc. It would be mostly care"
2493,Oh no. Did you explain it to him?
2494,You'll be more careful next time. Everyone makes mistakes.
2495,Why do you usually bring him along?
2496,How far away was it? 
2497,Oh man! I'm so sorry! Is there any part of the season you can still enjoy? 
2498,Do your parents feel terrible about that? (Not that you want them to....I just imagine they'd be pretty devastated to know that's why a holiday was ruined for you.) On the other hand -- I LOVE New Years!
2499,Why did he lie?
2500,What did he say for the reason?
2501,Why is she the love of your life?
2502,How does she complete you?
2503,Were you scared?
2504,What movies do you enjoy instead?
2505,"That is nice of her, did you have fun?"
2506,Who was all there?
2507,oooh really do ghosts exist 
2508,i used to but nowadays i don't what else
2509,Who won instead?
2510,Did you bet on the game? 
2511,"That is amazing! I went to college for a few years, never ended up graduating."
2512,"I studied hard for a while, but in the end it was just too much fun to party every weekend."
2513,You should not do that anymore.
2514,Can you retake it?
2515,That's too bad. All you can do is try harder next time.
2516,Did you say something?
2517,Did you say anything to the clerk?
2518,Did you say something to the clerk?
2519,Was there damage?
2520,Was there anyone else around?
2521,Did it turn out ok?
2522,What was the puzzle of?
2523,hahaha i can see hoe students laughed at you
2524,ahw that was good
2525,What about 3?
2526,I have never been to Asia.
2527,something wrong with your meal or what
2528,can you kick an innocent dog for nothing
2529,That isn't very nice.
2530,What about 4?
2531,Were you afraid or thrilled or both?
2532,Were you in the water?
2533,That is terrible news.
2534,How did you do it?
2535,That is wonderful! I actually won the lottery once myself and it changed my life for a bit.
2536,oh no! That is terrible. I didn't give anyone any money either. 
2537,That must be a good feeling.
2538,I use to go to church when I was little.
2539,Was it something that you could ignore?
2540,What did you do?
2541,That sucks. I am sorry for your loss.
2542,Maybe you should get a new one.
2543,Happiness comes and goes. it could change at any time.
2544,"As long as you take care of it, and use it the right way it will last you forever."
2545,"Oh, that does not seem very nice."
2546,"Yes, she and I have a bond that will be unbreakable."
2547,Why did you think that?
2548,What makes you qualified?
2549,Oh no! I did that last month. I still feel bad. Get them a gift to say sorry.
2550,Give him a call too. It is a bit more personal.
2551,I always try and order my food and get it delivered.
2552,"There a bunch of apps that let you buy food online, you should check it out!"
2553,That is a great idea for when emergencies happen!
2554,"Yes, that is a smart plan. Knowing that we cannot foresee the future, it is a good idea to be prepared."
2555,"Oh no, where to? That is hard."
2556,"Well, at least there is sand!"
2557,Why is that? Are you scared of something in the water?
2558,"I was pleased and shocked at the same time, I will take it!"
2559,Oh no! I'm so sorry!
2560,That is not fun. Hopefully it will not be too hard.
2561,"I expect that too, but it is not always the case."
2562,"Yes, you do. You can do it!"
2563,That's great to hear. Did you have to wait a long time to get it?
2564,"Oh, well I am very happy for you. I bet you were celebrating when you heard the good news!"
2565,After the interview was over I though it went very well. I am so confident I will get the job any day now!
2566,That's awesome! I love dog sitting no matter the occasion!
2567,That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise!
2568,"Awesome! I've never been able to sit that long, so getting really good at video games is hard for me"
2569,That's neat. I wish I had your motivation for...well...everything else in life.
2570,What is that?
2571,"Nice, how much did you get for it?"
2572,"That is so thoughtful of him, did you guys catch a ball? "
2573,I am sure it was! :) 
2574,tell me more about this
2575,but i would less satisfied
2576,Tell him to get out and do something! That must be frustrating. 
2577,Its hard being a parent... but i am sure you are doing it right! 
2578,I love peruvian food! What did you make?
2579,That green sauce with the cilantro and the jalepenos is the best! What is lomo?
2580,"Yum! I have all the ingredients for the chicken, I might make that now instead of the bbq chicken, thanks for the idea. "
2581,"Oh wow, sorry to hear, that was really rude of her."
2582,Some people can take things so far. I hate it when they do that.
2583,I am the type of person that gets what I have to buy and get out of the store. 
2584,"proud parent right , do you miss her during the year ?"
2585,one day my child will make me proud like that
2586,"thats a lot of kids, god bless"
2587,Going good...what's up with you.
2588,So how did  you do? Did the hard work pay off for you?
2589,Holy cow. I hate when that happens. It happens a lot here since I live near the ocean. How did it end up?
2590,"Wow, how lucky. How did you end up thanking that person?"
2591,Where are you moving to?
2592,I love California.
2593,Cool who were they up against? 
2594,Nice! 
2595,why would you do that
2596,I am not sure I get it
2597,I love it when teachers are down to earth and easy to get along with. What did you like most about him?
2598,That's pretty cool. Do you guys still keep in touch?
2599,Sorry to hear that. I hope you've had good teachers since then.
2600,I'm sorry to hear that. Did something happen to make you miss them?
2601,"Oh no! That is hard, I have the same issue. How far away did you move?"
2602,Omg! I am the same way... i always end up putting my list down while shopping. Where are you going? 
2603,Thats so kind of them! 
2604,"oh man, i'm sorry to hear that! We all make mistakes though, so it's okay. don't be hard on yourslef"
2605,"it's okay though, i'm sure you learned from your mistake"
2606,i know how you feel. I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. I just got food stamps so i can buy food for me and my son
2607,I encourage you to apply for it no matter what
2608,Its a good time to jog right now in the morning. good for you! 
2609,"I know it does I am right in FL! I dont jog, I work out but running isnt my thing. "
2610,What kind of risk are you taking?
2611,"Yikes, that's stressful. How big is the family?"
2612,I am so sorry. You must be heartbroken.
2613,How long was he part of your life?
2614,Did the dog bark at him?
2615,That sounds terrible. Sorry to hear that. What exactly happened?
2616,"That's the worst, when you personally know someone that treated you badly. I hope things turn out better for you. "
2617,oh no.. are you upset? 
2618,awh thats good it turned out well afterall 
2619,"Yeah, I think most people feel that way, but it's still a valid feeling. How did it end up?"
2620,that's great to hear! Did you have any cool teachers or make any new friends?
2621,I bet that was a little scary
2622,"Oh well, I am sure most people forgot about it quickly"
2623,"Thats awesome! Im glad you persisted because that is so important these days, not being able to swim is a real danger!"
2624,"Yes, sounds like your doing a great job with the little guy!"
2625,"Oh no, did it take you a long time to figure out what the issue was?"
2626,"Dogs can be a little squeamish when it comes to that sort of thing. I wouldn't feel bad, it could happen to anyone!"
2627,I know you are over the moon. What did you have?
2628,Enjoy every minute with him. Time goes fast when they are little.
2629,"That is horrible, so sad."
2630,"Yes, fire prevention shouldn't be that hard."
2631,Wow! I'm so envious! How long ago did you buy it?
2632,"Makes sense. when you know what you want, you should go for it. Well, I'm happy for you. I'm far away from being able to do that."
2633,I bet you had a wonderful time together
2634,how fun! Where did you guys go?
2635,I bet
2636,"That is good to hear, less weight the better"
2637,The loud roars also make my dog shake and run to the basement
2638,"My dog never used to do that, it was only just recently that he started doing that."
2639,"Oh no, was anoyone hurt?"
2640,"That is good news, I hope your car is ok."
2641,You must have been so proud of their hard work.
2642,Was it a large graduating class?
2643,"Wow, I am glad you got help, that could have been a lot worse"
2644,"That is so sweet of him, those are the people we need more of in the world"
2645,how was the experience?
2646,"It was good you got over the fear, do you ride roller coasters more now?"
2647,"Oh my gosh, that's terrible. How did that happen"
2648,"That's one of my worst fears when I drive to my girlfriend's parents' house. So everything ended up being okay, though?"
2649,what do you think your score was?
2650,Ah thats a good score.  When i took the LSATs about 15-16 years ago I received a 156 i believe.  Where do you hope to go to school?
2651,I too was surprised.  To leave the team again sort of upset me.
2652,He is a legend in the making
2653,I feel the same way. The times you spend with family should be cherished forever.
2654,"I agree, be grateful for those in your life because they help you become a better person."
2655,Congratulations?  How much did you win?
2656,Wow.  Now you can spoil yourself
2657,He already left for the Lakers.
2658,He technically is from Akron not Cleveland.
2659,"That is sweet of him, marriage can be tough at first, so at least he is trying"
2660,"That is true, marriage is great in a vaccuum, but life pops the bag sometimes"
2661,Was it a long campaign?
2662,I bet it did
2663,Lebron isnt a saint though
2664,how did you do?
2665,were you able to retake it?
2666,"That is great, did you spend it on anything cool?"
2667,"That is smart as well, future you will appreciate that!"
2668,I am happy that you have someone to share your life with.
2669,Keep the faith that it will continue.
2670,"That's seriously impressive. Sounds like a lot of work, though. Hope it all works out. Are you nervous?"
2671,"Well, you sound confident. And applying and getting in is one of the toughest steps, so I'm sure you'll do fine."
2672,Wow. That is great.  Not everyone can say that.
2673,Most struggle in their first year.  That is amazing that you did so well.
2674,I am an older student too so I hope things go well for me in school.
2675,"Oh no, did the relative say what happened? That sounds fishy."
2676,"It's an easy mistake to make, we're supposed to trust family, you know?"
2677,Thats great.  I love taking the kids to Disneyworld.  What do you want to see most?
2678,Yea you wont be disappointed.  Its wonderful there.
2679,I am sure you were happy
2680,All that hard work was worth it I am sure
2681,Making a change can be hard. Did you take the offer?
2682,It's always best to do nothing if your not sure.
2683,were you able to do any extra credit to bring up the grade?
2684,That stinks. There's always next time!
2685,"Oh, very interesting. I'm not a fan of the owner either. Why do you feel that way, though?"
2686,"That's a fair point. But Lebron James is different, and probably seeks to try to really control the team he is on, so that can be difficult too"
2687,how long have you two known eachother?
2688,I think you just need to give it time. Hopefully she will come around.
2689,What were you thinking? Have you been thinking it over for a long time?
2690,Was she keeping him in her classroom? I can see how that can be a lot of work.
2691,That's nice. Hard to find nowadays.
2692,I know. I wish things were better!
2693,"I do too honestly, I used to play all these fun games with our neighbors late summer nights, it was amazing, but I took it for granted"
2694,"I hear you there, that is the worst part!"
2695,I remember those games too. What kinds did you play? My favorite was flashlight tag.
2696,Ghost in the graveyard was a blast! I can't believe I forgot that one. It sounds like we both had great childhoods.
2697,"I get that, I am not sure how some of these people can afford the places they go!"
2698,"Yeah, that is not me at all, I barely post anything to people online"
2699,How exciting for you. What kind of car is it?
2700,That was so generous of them.
2701,That is not nice! People do that all the time as long as the person they tell is closer to them
2702,"Everyone believes that of course, but I believe you, people make mistakes"
2703,"Ugh I remember those days! All the shopping, making sure to look good for the first day! good times"
2704,"Me too, I am looking forward to winter and christmas, much better in my opinion!"
2705,congratulations. marry her
2706,then maybe you should cheat.
2707,"I am sure you are, that sounds bad"
2708,There are just bad people out there
2709,That takes a lot of strength to be able to do that. A lot of people would just break down instead of trying to help however they can.
2710,"Good for you, I'm sure your dad is so very thankful for you."
2711,"Yikes, did anything out of the ordinary happen?"
2712,"That is weird, sorry to hear that, paying more money is never fun at all"
2713,Wow that's awesome.
2714,Why so surprised>
2715,I know exactly what you mean.
2716,It makes it hard to communicate though.
2717,"I am sorry to hear that, how did it end between you?"
2718,"That makes sense, sometimes things are just not meant to be"
2719,"that is no good, I am sorry that happened to you"
2720,"It happens I suppose, maybe there is some sort of refund policy where you bought it from"
2721,WOW! Why do people have to be violent... ugh 
2722,right me either. its too bad but glad you are thinking right! 
2723,Oh no. Not another Lebron story.
2724,I know. He is a great player though.
2725,thats nice.
2726,sorry to hear that.
2727,Where are you headed to?
2728,"Oh, well that sounds like it will be a ton of fun, I hope all goes well!"
2729,Oh no! How old were you at the time?
2730,"That's like a bad dream scenario. Better to be a little kid though, even if kids are mean."
2731,Please don't care about those people. Try to be true to yourself. World will recognize you one day.  
2732,Exactly. You're right. Ignore them. 
2733,Have you been married a long time?
2734,I know that had to hurt. But forgive her and let her make it up to you.
2735,"Dads can be strange like that sometimes. Was he trying to be malicious about it, or just having fun?"
2736,What did he used to do?
2737,Why did things end between you?
2738,"Oh, yeah I understand that, it is the same way with my girlfriend now"
2739,I was just saying the same thing.
2740,I'm only 34 and a lot of my old friend are dead.
2741,Was your previous neighbor good at least?
2742,"Ah, well at least you can only meet or exceed expectations!"
2743,Why did it make you feel awkward?
2744,"Oh, well I am sure the date was just happy you were there!"
2745,That's a shame - I'm glad that you've got friends now though. Why was that?
2746,I thikn lots of people are shy until they find where they belong.
2747,"i bet you did, did you want a boy instead of a girl?"
2748,"That is a good mindset, I wish you the best of luck with that!"
2749,how did it happen?
2750,"how, did you get into trouble?"
2751,"I understand that, he seemed to seal his own fate there, but still sad"
2752,"Potentially, he seemed a bit deadset, but we do not know too much all in all"
2753,how much do they run?
2754,damn.. how times have changed..
2755,Was it Roseanne?
2756,Me too. What show are you talking about?
2757,That can be a hard situation to deal with. Any chance of moving?
2758,Good for you. Just hang on best you can until your in a better place.
2759,"Aww, that is so sweet! I'm sure you were very happy"
2760,"Oh yeah, definitely! She seems like a very good girlfriend to do that for you. Sounds like y'all have a good future ahead."
2761,Oh no... maybe you can get it fixed asap so no one will be upset? 
2762,I am sure it was glad its fixed 
2763,How does it hold up now?
2764,"well that is good, that seems rare!"
2765,The results for what?
2766,"Well, best of luck, I am sure you did awesome!"
2767,Childhood is a boon and it never be taken again. But everyone wishes to do so. 
2768,Me too. Try to spend time with kids. We can get into their life for sometime.
2769,well theres only one way to find out!
2770,"yea, everyone probably does at one point or another."
2771,Oh no! I would have too. Did you find him?
2772,Oh... Interesting. A hole under the fence? I'm sorry to hear that.
2773,thats amazing.. im happy for him too.. i bet you are proud 
2774,thats to be expected but you seem like a caring person 
2775,"Wow, that's terrifying.get really big? Did it "
2776,"That is crazy lucky. Well, I'm glad everything ended up okay."
2777,Oh that sounds very exciting! What kind of car?
2778,That is so awesome! Happy for you!
2779,"That is nasty, did it get on anyone else? that would not be fun"
2780,"That is so nasty, I am glad I was not there"
2781,wow ! that's really awesome. What kind of car did you get?
2782,what? that's absolutely horrble
2783,"Shock? Uh oh, what happened? Is everything okay?"
2784,"Ohhh... That makes more sense. Well, congratulations. That's a defining point in people's lives. I hope you have a great experience."
2785,im sorry.. distance sucks. luckily you guys have skype! 
2786,I know because sometimes technology doesnt work the way we want it too.. i hope you get to be together again soon. 
2787,how did it go?
2788,how did you make up for it?
2789,Did you find him?
2790,How long has it been? I am so sorry. That must be so difficult.
2791,No!!! gross... did you flip? 
2792,i am sure it wasnt 
2793,Hah... I have a teenage sister. I can agree. But they can have their good moments. I hope for the best for you.
2794,"With the way you sound, I'm sure you'll have the patience and the wisdom to raise her the right way through the teenage years anyway."
2795,Congrats!!! Do you already have a job lined up? 
2796,thats so awesome good for you 
2797,Don't we all!  Work is often times one of the most stressful things in life.
2798,Where do you suppose you would like to take a break at?
2799,That's a large amount of money!
2800,"He is a Superbowl caliber QB, so I guess he deserves it."
2801,What happens Tuesday?
2802,"Nice, how much will you get?"
2803,that is so cool! omg beautiful.. what part of france? 
2804,"beautiful, congrats! "

2809,"Oh wow, that was nice of your friend, that is not a fun situation to be in"
2810,Well that is a true friend right there then!
2811,"That's nuts, do you know if they are ok?"
2812,Ah ok. That's crazy though. Hope they are ok.
2813,Have you called animal control? What about putting up flyers?
2814,Maybe someone found her and took her in.
2815,Were you able to help? How scary for that child!
2816,That's good. I am glad it was a happy ending.
2817,I know you're not asking for advice but... DONT. Just dont.

2819,My anxiety would have been having anxiety - so I feel you... hows the dog doing today? 
2820,Awh.. if shes okay today she will be fine! 
2821,I bet you'll be fine if you work hard enough. What language is it?
2822,"I feel that way sometimes but it's the best way to learn, and it only gets easier!"
2823,That is so sad.. im sorry! ugh... i hope you can find peace. 
2824,what a cute name... i am sure you will.. again im sorry! 
2825,At least you feel bad about it?
2826,"how, how are you going to spend it? or are you a saver?"
2827,thats a good choice
2828,Eek!  I hate spiders!  Did you kill it?
2829,Oh no!  That's too bad.  Now you will have to keep an eye out for it!
2830,Did it go well for you then?
2831,"It's great when it works out that way, I hate presenting."
2832,You should take it somewhere then
2833,You need to save up then
2834,Did he give you tips for getting the best deal?
2835,"That's really sweet, I'm happy for you"

2844,It can happen.Were you better prepared for the next one?
2845,It can be a hard lesson to learn but will make you a better student.
2846,My cousin bought a really pretty shirt that I had been wanting
2847,No I can but I didn't want her to have it and not me.
2848,I understand.. i wish life could be eaiser! Im sorry.. whats going on? 
2849,sounds like a lot of stress... i hope things change for you VERY soon! 
2850,"Oh no, I hope you feel better soon. Do you want to talk about it?"
2851,"I'm so sorry. Have you tried reading Rainbow Bridge, that could provide some comfort."
2852,wouldnt that be cool and your bestfriend would be kevin 
2853,yup
2854,What did she do for your birthday?
2855,"I understand that completely, I still have a bit of time to wait"
2856,"I get that, sometimes it is not in the cards though"
2857,Did you get in?
2858,"That is nice of him, that is a good dad right there!"
2859,"oh, I am sorry to hear that he passed away..."
2860,How do they help
2861,They sound like good people
2862,"Me too, I dislike heat but I love the leisure"
2863,"Me too, that made summer great as a kid!"
2864,"That is good you met your girlfriend, where did you meet?"
2865,Where did you go to college.
2866,Nothing wrong with that.
2867,"No, only one extra day isn't bad."
2868,IS that a real thing?
2869,Wow. The first one is so old now.
2870,That's amazing!  How much did you win and what did you buy with it?
2871,Smart move!  Good for you for deciding to use it responsibly.
2872,"That's so sweet! Always a special moment, how old is she?"
2873,I bet you are so proud!
2874,I can understand that. My husband went to a friends to work on his car. I'm home with 5 kids!
2875,Ha ha! No loneliness here. I think the biggest worry is craziness.
2876,"oh how sad, how did you lose your car?. Public transportation is not every one's cup of tea.."
2877,you guy's will get back everything you have lost. It is difficult for travel as you said
2878,"oh no, that is unfortunate. are you alright?"
2879,"wow, you might just have bad luck"
2880,i would just take an uber from now on if i were you.
2881,Thats sounds so delicious.  How did it turn out?
2882,Did everyone else enjoy your new found passion for cooking?
2883,That's always a great holiday. What did you do to celebrate?
2884,Sounds like a great time! Did you celebrate with family or friends?
2885,I'm super bummed out. I worked really hard for this promotion and I ended up not getting it.
2886,"I'm not sure, my boss won't return my request for a meeting emails."
2887,"I'm excited personally, I guess you have to like your school and what you're studying."
2888,I hate writing papers too. That's why I am an engineering major. Lol its still pretty hard though.
2889,I bet you are excited for that
2890,"Yeah, it's always hard to leave in those situations. Are you flying to see her?"
2891,"I live near the beach, too! It really is great. Although I've been out of town for a while, so I haven't been to it yet this summer. I'm glad you got to go there."
2892,Only thing I'm not wild about is dealing with cleaning up afterwards.
2893,Why weren't you able to do it?
2894,"Oh man that sucks, do you feel bad about it?"
2895,I'm sure if you apologize he'll understand at least a little. Were you just really busy or something?
2896,Sometimes people say things they don't mean when their angry. Maybe you should just let it go.
2897,"Well, you both have the same blood, so I would advise just to let bygones be bygones."
2898,"thats awesome, love the positive vibes. good for you! "
2899,good paying job and keeps you active! 
2900,Whoa... that's awesome. I love hearing that. Can you tell me about them?
2901,"Absolutely. I'm glad you're experiencing that. Me on the other hand, I'd be worried that I wasn't good enough for them. But I'm sure things will work out for you."
2902,Yes it is... when can you see her again? 
2903,well i hope you two get to spend a lot of time together when she comes up 
2904,That sounds like trouble. What exactly is going on?
2905,"Dang! I'm not a parent, but I have siblings who have done the same (and of course I've done it to my parents, too). Any idea what you're going to do?"
2906,Oh my!  I have never heard that before.  I hate feeling that powerless but it is bound to happen many more times unfortunately
2907,That sounds shady.  Did it ever get worked out?
2908,That is very discouraging.   I am sorry you have to deal with that stress.
2909,Oh that is terrible! Kids are so mean! What did you do?
2910,I hope that it only gets better.
2911,What happened to make it that way
2912,"Yeah that sucks, I have gone through that too"
2913,"Yes, it's hard to see people you know and care about struggling.  Are they doing better?"
2914,That's great to hear!  I hope it stays that way and whateer troubles they had are subsided
2915,That's great! Are you getting better at driving?
2916,Are you going to buy a car?
2917,Thats good to hear and do
2918,I hate being late
2919,How did you do?
2920,That's great! Congrats!
2921,That is outstanding!  I bet you are excited!
2922,That is great news and a lot to be proud of!
2923,"That is the greatest feeling in the world, to see them smiling."
2924,I do.  A child's laugh takes away all of life's stress.
2925,I would be scared of that
2926,I am not sure I am ever prepared
2927,So why didn't you end up going?
2928,"It happens to everyone, you'll feel better about it soon"
2929,"Wow, that can be stressful, Why were you happy?"
2930,Maybe she should have just quit! but i hope the best for her in the future.
2931,"indeed, the future could be bright for her."
2932,when are they?
2933,good luck
2934,"oh, did you lose it somewhere?"
2935,Good you got it back.
2936,"Ah, that is no good! Why didn't you get to leave early?"
2937,I know what that is like! I hate being an adult sometimes!
2938,"wow congrats, how long have you worked there?"
2939,thats cool
2940,"I feel like since the show, catfishing has decreased a little bit. It's easy to determine when someone is using fake pictures."
2941,I have and it didn't go so well for me. I hope your experience is!
2942,No I didn't that's pretty awesome lol...is that the show where celebrities get slimed
2943,That's cool I remember it was a big theme in Nickelodeon. I'd be so embarrassed if I was the losing family...but I'm sure they all got paid so it was worth
2944,Was it a surprise?
2945,That is so cool. I bet you were happy!
2946,"I'm so sorry, what happened?"
2947,You must be missing here very much.
2948,I saw that.  It was pretty crazy!
2949,What are your thoughts on that?
2950,wow thats a good feeling to have
2951,you seem to have done a good job. congrats
2952,Well that sounds just wonderful! What kind of entrepreneur are you?
2953,You've sparked my curiosity on the last one haha!
2954,Did you try talking with your supervisor 1 on 1?
2955,Well I hope it works out for you.
2956,"That is really weird, did he actually knock the tree down and how thick was the tree?"
2957,I wonder how long it would take him to kick through a large and wide tree.
2958,Nice did your friend give you a piece?
2959,Cool what kind of pizza was it
2960,That's awesome. You must be so proud of her!
2961,That's a good goal!  I recommend online dating if you are trying to meet many different women!
2962,I hear eharmony is pretty good.  I have a couple friends who have had success with it.
2963,"I know the feeling of finish finals, but not with all A's. Congrats buddy!"
2964,What are your plans afterwards?
2965,Awww man that stinks! I thought you two were going well.
2966,"Yeah, but like 10 years of that committed time."
2967,"I agree, people who catfish need to get their priorities straight."
2968,"Exactly, looks are not the only think that matter in this world."
2969,I sure hope they say YES with a very low interest rate. Will this be your first home?
2970,A very exciting and scary time of life. I remember it well.
2971,"Fine, what did happen at last?"
2972,Good. Is it a bike race?
2973,Oh no. What happened?
2974,That's very kind of your manager. 
2975,Being sick does stink at times. But at least your husband is there to assist when in need.
2976,Hopefully your kids also understand and aren't being a handful.
2977,"What was the game? That happens to me all the time too, it's a treat to remember such great times."
2978,I remember that show! And the books! But I had no idea there was a game!
2979,have you asked them? 
2980,they seem like not very nice people! im sorry 
2981,How much! Sometimes things happen like that when you really need them!
2982,"Wow, I hate when people feel like it's okay to waste other peoples time."
2983,I'm glad you are. You deserve to work for a company that values you and your time.
2984,"aww, it's amazing how fast time flies and how quickly kids grow up."
2985,I think like that with my kids. This sounds cliche but it's so bittersweet. 
2986,did he lose it?
2987,"Boy, that's pretty messed up."
2988,"Ouch, seeing that news probably knocked your mood down hard."
2989,Yeah that is like half a year of rent for me. I would be livid.
2990,Im glad to hear it brought memories and not tears! Its hard losing a parent. 
2991,yes we do i understand i lost both of my parents at 22 
2992,Oh really? Is there any specific reason why?
2993,That's great! Do you have good days often?
2994,That's awesome! Gotta take credit for those genes haha
2995,haha that's cool...always good to have the best of both worlds
2996,I absolutely agree with that mind set! Pick something you're passionate about and do it with passion!
2997,"I'm a fitness enthusiast myself, and you'd be surprised how people even find reason to be negative about THAT."
2998,About what exactly?
2999,What did he need it for?
3000,Why do you hide it?
3001,Why is that considered more attractive?
3002,It must have felt good to see him after such a long time.
3003,A brothers bond is unbreakable. I'm glad you guys got to spend some time together. 
3004,"They are just kids, I think you should give them toys to play with and also take a pain killer"
3005,:) we have all being through the age. You will miss this stage when they finally grow to become adult
3006,I think so! That sounds like you worked so very hard for the company!
3007,Have you tried to talk to him?
3008,I am glad that it is
3009,Its nice to have things like that happen
3010,Where was it to?? 
3011,sounds awesome! 
3012,I've never been in an eating contest! How much jello did you eat to win? 
3013,What was the prize for winning? 
3014,Wow that's kind of cool. 
3015,"Yeah, those are rough when you are so hopeful about it."
3016,"Yeah, hopefully your still looking for another internship."
3017,I bet.. what did she pass away from? 
3018,ugh thats terrible im sorry for your loss 
3019,I hope she is okay
3020,"I bet, good luck though"
3021,So many people are.
3022,I totally agree. Why do you think some people really like him though.
3023,Did you call to complain?
3024,Less salt is always better than to much salt on food.
3025,I'm sorry to hear that. Why would you considering putting it on hold?
3026,"Yeah, raising kids is very tough. I do hope everything works out for you. Just find a way to keep your motivation up!"
3027,That is disappointing.  I wonder if you can see if anyone you know is doing it and they can hype you up for it.  
3028,That is no good!
3029,oh no... will you tell them? 
3030,i think so its for the best 
3031,What job?  Don't be discouraged if you don't get it though!  Keep trying!
3032,"Everything happens for a reason.  When one door closes, another one opens!"
3033,Woah! That's super scary! Did it do anything to you?
3034,So creepy...I wouldn't be able to forget it either...
3035,I am sorry to hear that
3036,That isnt too far
3037,Is he okay now?
3038,thats a good bond how long have you been together? 
3039,very adorable good for you guys 
3040,was that  the only time you stole in your life?
3041,That was very cool of your dad.He taught you a lesson.
3042,How is everything coming together? 
3043,What did you want to happen exactly? 
3044,That is sad
3045,That makes me feel better
3046,I bet that wasn't a great feeling.
3047,I am assuming you did study hard for it right?
3048,That sucks! Have you been able to contact the bus company yet and get it back?
3049,Oh no! Would your phone cost a lot to replace?
3050,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it turns up.
3051,"Wow that was a long time ago, I am sure that you regret it now and have learned from your mistake."
3052,That's good that your friend wasn't affected by your actions too badly. If you guys moved on from it then it was a great learning opportunity!
3053,Its okay to stay at home
3054,Tv can be fun though
3055,Most kids are like that. I was definitely scared.
3056,Most of us do that too. Kids over reacy to new environments
3057,Don't be.I am sure you are ready.
3058,We all are.
3059,Awesome!  Where are you going!  I am jealous!
3060,No I am really jealous!  I have wanted to go there for the longest time.  I am happy for you!
3061,how thats cool.  
3062,hard work must pay off if you are seeing results! congrats
3063,"That sucks to hear. I don't know too much about basketball, to be honest. Was it really a big deal?"
3064,"I hear a lot of people say that, he must be real good. What team would you prefer to see him on?"
3065,"So, you are not anymore?"
3066,Did you graduate?
3067,Why does he do that
3068,I guess thats a reason
3069,That is extremely lucky.  It's nice to know there are still good people in the world.
3070,"Wow.  That sure saved you a lot of money on replacing a phone, too!"
3071,"Oh no really, that really sucks to hear. Why were you not able to go?"
3072,"It is sad that you can not go, but you are making a good sacrifice to make sure your family will be able to survive. Also you could use the alone time to do stuff you are not able to do with them around!"
3073,"I am sorry, they are sweet animals"
3074,That is adorable
3075,oh i hope she got better
3076,well thats great news!
3077,Why did she break up?
3078,Did she give you a reason why she didn't love you anymore?
3079,That's bad. I feel sorry for you 
3080,Oh god. Thanks. I feel care for you. 
3081,I felt the same way. 
3082,Are they coming back soon?
3083,That is never a good thing to do
3084,You will get through it
3085,"Surely not, do you trust her. "
3086,"Then I wouldn't be worried, you can't live your life that way. If someone wants to cheat, they will find a way. "
3087,Congratulations! It must've been a very happy day for you and your family.
3088,I could imagine. I one day hope to experience that feeling.
3089,Oh? How did you find him?
3090,Oh he must be a good boy then or girl.
3091,what happened to it?
3092,that stinks
3093,Why are you happy
3094,That is nice to hear
3095,I'm so sorry to hear that.
3096,I lost my grandmother last year. It is a rough thing to go through.
3097,I am very sorry to hear about your loss. take you were very close.
3098,I am sure she is in a better place now.
3099,"That is great to hear!  Part of being successful is being confident, and you sure sound confident!"
3100,Try to be confident but not overly entitled.  There is a fine line between the two.  Congrats though if you get the job!
3101,Wow that must have been a terrifying experience. Are you ok now?
3102,That is good that you escaped your accident with a minor injury. Please take care of yourself in the future!
3103,I am sure that will be fun
3104,I bet you have a lot of good times
3105,I could imagine! How do you lose your dog?
3106,"Oh, wow! Those dogs are smart! What did you change to make sure it doesn't happen again?"
3107,wow im sorry to hear that. you still stay in contact?
3108,thats good
3109,Wow what did they say about skipping it?
3110,probably won't forgive him for a long time.
3111,I bet that was stressful
3112,I am sure they did not mind doing that
3113,How'd he get out?
3114,"Oh man, I hope you weren't too hard on the kids."
3115,wow thats awesome
3116,sounds like you will be using that often
3117,"Yes, but I will be sad when it ends."
3118,I can't wait to find out the end of the series.
3119,Why?
3120,"That's sad, did you move away from your parents?"
3121,I'm sorry to hear that. That would be hard. 
3122,Did he just come back to you?
3123,That is pretty great! My dog takes forever at time because he's playing with the neighbors dogs.
3124,"oh no, did you ever get caught"
3125,did you learn your lesson?
3126,"I bet you were, poor pup"
3127,That is good to hear
3128,Oh my gosh! Did you run and hide?
3129,I don't live in an area that is known for tornadoes but they still scare me. I'm glad you're ok!
3130,Oh gosh I hope so too!
3131,I guess you got to just wait and see.
3132,wow thats cool!
3133,i bet that night was fun!
3134,Did it get resolved
3135,"Well that sucks, sorry"
3136,Well you should always think that. It's not hard once you get into the groove of it.
3137,Hopefully you do go to college. I had fun but was stressful.
3138,I guess guys tend to do that
3139,Forward isnt always good
3140,"How old were you? That can be dangerous, you hear stories of people falling in all the time."
3141,I'd be scared too!
3142,I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried looking for him.
3143,What kind of dog do you have?
3144,what position did you play
3145,because of my illness i got some frustration too
3146,family is much needed thing during these time. take care of your health
3147,"Wow, I sure beat he beat your butt, I bet you thought you had it in the bag, rigtht?"
3148,"Hahaha that just goes to show ya, age is just a umber!'"
3149,For sure. Trust is a key driver in having a good relationship with anyone. If you can't trust people then you will feel like you are alone a lot.
3150,I agree with that. You should be able to trust people until they prove that they are untrustworthy. 
3151,how often do you eat it?
3152,Dogs can be bad. Did he come home?
3153,We've all been there. How did you do?
3154,That was nice. That doesnt always happen.
3155,Yeah that does make you feel good. But make sure it's a good charity.
3156,I like those too especially when i don't want change anymore.
3157,Well dang! Are you feeling alright?
3158,I had an experience like that before - one that I never want to live again. How is the driver?
3159,"Oh goodness, I bet that made you jealous!"
3160,Wow! I'm glad it didn't escalate to that point!
3161,I bet that tasted good
3162,"Oh well, at least it was something"
3163,It was a huge achievement when I graduated too. Did you get good grades?
3164,Nice. Did you go onto to university?
3165,what do you think happened to it?
3166,Well that sounds really sad. How long was he missing for?
3167,Did you ever find him?
3168,Oh man! I hate big storms too. Was it as bad as a hurricane?
3169,Well that's good. Did you lose any shingles from your roof?
3170,did you say something?
3171,wow thats cool
3172,That's an awesome experience. How was the wedding?
3173,Did they have an awesome catering service? I am looking one for my wedding that is coming up
3174,How do you like it so far
3175,I am sure you will
3176,Yes. And in the closet too
3177,MY cousins used to play scary tricks on me. I hated that.
3178,That's awesome! Were you invited to the wedding?
3179,Do you know your co-worker very well? What do you think you'll get them for a gift?
3180,How far away does she live?
3181,Wow that is pretty cool of her to do.
3182,I bet you were proud
3183,That is great to hear
3184,why dont you tell them to stop?
3185,yea i coud understand that
3186,That is great news!  Was he lost?
3187,"That has definitely got to be a relief that he is back!  That is the best case scenario.  Hopefully, he never gets away again.  Make sure to check your fence!"
3188,oh wow. did you clean it up
3189,wow that stinks
3190,What happened to him? Did he run away?
3191,Oh wow. Did you put posters up all over the neighborhood to find him?
3192,oh wow congrats
3193,i wish i could go back to get another degree. thats great that you were able to do that
3194,Thank god! Was your dog missing?
3195,haha dogs always want to go out and play.
3196,"Hopefully, another position opens up! I'm so sorry to hear that."
3197,That sounds so gross! Did you try any yourself?
3198,Likewise! I even too terrified to try sushi. It just looks so slimy.
3199,"Wow, that is very annoying. What will you do clean the carpet?"
3200,That is good idea.
3201,Summer was so much fun! What did you usually do with your cousins?
3202,I used to be an outdoorsy person myself. Did you guys ever go to the pool?
3203,I'm so sorry! Have you complained at all?
3204,That's unfortunate. I hope that something changes soon. It is detrimental to your health!
3205,haha so what are they like now?
3206,I hope you taught them that it doesn't!
3207,I'll be your friend
3208,I used to have a had time making friends when I was younger. 
3209,Thats great! How old are you.
3210,You're never too old to have fun! Don't ever think that. Always stay a kid at heart
3211,Awwwww that's so sad to here. Where did you rescue her from?
3212,I would have done the same thing! Who does that guy think he is? I would've tried kicking him back.
3213,Oh that's really bad!
3214,That is just sad. People in education dying really sucks.
3215,That's cool. What did you guys all do?
3216,I bed it was exciting just because of the idea of getting caught!
3217,Oh wow! Wasn't expecting that. But kissing your girlfriend is hardly something to be shamed of.
3218,Maybe someone is playing a trick on you
3219,Set a trap. Or maybe just a camera
3220,How's it going with that?
3221,hahaha I've been that way too.
3222,No but I've had my hours so reduced that it wasn't working going to work due to everything going to union dues and transportation.
3223,"Oh, that's never any good. Did the group see you do anything embarrassing?"
3224,"Well, that does sure sound like a show. I bet they shared a bunch of laughs over those wretched and foul farts."
3225,"hm never tried baked salad. How'd it go, Ramsey?"
3226,"Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better."
3227,It's been raining hard here in Virginia too. Did you get whisked away in a flash flood?
3228,Some days trapped inside the house aren't always bad. At least you don't have to think too hard on what to do.
3229,That is good! What work do you do there?
3230,Must find some cool things while doing it.
3231,That's horrible. Did they divorce?
3232,Of course! betrayal is horrifying to go through. I hope he became a better man for it?
3233,That's so sweet.
3234,Was it for your birthday?
3235,I hope I work with nice people like that one day.
3236,There is so much different kinds it can be daunting sometimes on where to find the good stuff.
3237,Oh wow. I would suggest using Spotify and then make a radio playlist on your favorites artists. That is how I find newer but similar music.
3238,Sometimes it takes a while to really hone into your preferences. 
3239,A+ for creativity.
3240,"Never ventured, nothing gained and all."
3241,Seems like things turned out for the better. What is she going to do with the winnings?
3242,Sounds like the responsible thing to do. Hopefully she gets a new one soon and her luck continues.
3243,How exciting! Where is your friend originally from?
3244,So awesome! Has she ever been to America before?
3245,That is good stuff.  I bet that made you feel good!
3246,You are so much fun!  Jogging gives off a pretty good feeling too!
3247,I hate that too! Do you make him clean it up?
3248,That's a tough situation to be in. I would just take all his belongings to the dump and be done with it. Maybe he can stay there too.
3249,"Yea, you can do whatever you want."
3250,That's for sure. How long have you had your independence?
3251,Really? Why?
3252,I don't like vacations that make you feel like you are still at home. Where do you live?
3253,"Awwwww, poor little doggie. Did you end up helping the poor thing?"
3254,That's good! Small dogs like that make excellent companions. Do you plan on keeping him?
3255,"Wow, that's interesting. What do you do with it?"
3256,Oh no- Well I am the opposite. I rescue bambi and small critters :)
3257,That's too bad to hear. What's wrong with her?
3258,That's incredibly awful. At least the surgery fixed the injury (I assume). Did the doctors say when she is going to wake up?
3259,"Think I've done that, too. No regrets, my friend."
3260,They are tasty sins.
3261,are they being loud and annoying like usual?
3262,"Ugh, well good think mine are still at summer camp."
3263,What's game club
3264,Sounds like a fun club though. My school didn't have anything like that.
3265,Well congratulations! What will you be doing at your new billet?
3266,"You managed to get a promotion, so you're obviously talented. I'm sure you will do just fine and earn many more promotions."
3267,"Oh no, how dare he! Doesn't he know that is forbidden"
3268,That's so sad :( Maybe he should buy you a substitute
3269,that was nice of you
3270,it could have been sentimental. like a gift from someone special
3271,Wow. How'd that go?
3272,That must've been embarassing. Happens to us all.
3273,Me too! I helped a guy with his immigration case and saved him from being deported. He ended up becoming a pastor.
3274,He deserved it. He was fighting for his life.
3275,That's too bad. What seems to be wrong with him?
3276,Doesn't sound good at all. Has anyone taken him to get it checked out?
3277,Big Mac's are heaven in your mouth.
3278,"I mean you can still go back for more after this. Don't give up, bro."
3279,I stayed at home - I hate trying to fight over that 50% off pack of pencils at Staples. What did you do?
3280,Sounds like a swell purchase. Have you taught Big Brother Alexa to say any mischievous phrases?
3281,"I'm sorry to hear that, what led you to this?"
3282,"Yea, you need to stay away from those, especially if you don't know who they are, your email should be able to block stuff like that, look in the settings."
3283,"Oh wow, you must have a lot of responsibility there!"
3284,That sounds fun! You must be really happy about it. 
3285,Awww... how long have you had him?
3286,Why didnt it work out?
3287,Oh well that's good.
3288,Are you attending post secondary?
3289,That's awesome! What are you and your kids taking?
3290,Thats cool! What band is it?
3291,Fantastic! That would be so fun!
3292,That sounds great. Was it a promotion or maybe a raise?
3293,Oh I see. Well thats all very exciting. If you keep working at it Im sure you will continue to be successful. It will pay off.
3294,O no! That's a terrible thing to have happen or see.
3295,Was the person ok?
3296,Oh! What is it for? Just remember to think of all your good qualities and the interviewers :)
3297,Cool! What industry is it in? I hope you get the job!
3298,What city are in right now?
3299,"Oh well, be carreful.Make sure nobody is following you."
3300,Oh wow. Well are you going to use it? Why are you ashamed?
3301,Why did you buy it then?
3302,Wow that's awesome. Congratulations
3303,Did you like the food?
3304,Can you explain more?
3305,Donate is good thing to do. Great
3306,That is so disgusting!
3307,I probably would have done the same thing.
3308,I am a teacher so I understand.  You must be working well with him!  Do teachers know what accommodations to make or how to differentiate for him to be successful in the classroom?
3309,The amount of pride he will have in himself with speak volumes.  Let his new teachers know what works for him.  You are his best advocate!
3310,That is awesome! What do you go to school for?
3311,"Well if you are doing so well, I wouldn't quit! Good luck!"
3312,How sweet. How is it now?
3313,It great that he has a good home then.
3314,He must love his grandkids.
3315,"Ah well, he raised your and your brother so he knows what hes doing."
3316,"Don't feel bad, many people are experiencing the same feelings.  Try to focus on meeting new and interesting people!"
3317,Have you tried online dating?  Many of my friends have experienced success with apps like eharmony!
3318,That's not fair. Why didn;t they split it up with more people.
3319,That's terrible. Maybe you can get a promotion if you get it all done.
3320,That sounds pretty admirable. What kind of animal? Dog?
3321,"Yeah, I'm afraid to get a cat because you never know what kind of personality you'll get with them"
3322,Thats very admirable.
3323,Enabling is pretty bad. People don't learn if someone is always saving them from every thing.
3324,"I'm about to watch it! Please don't spoil it. I'm excited for it, even though I've only seen a couple of TV shows and movies based off of his books, and only read a couple of the actual books"
3325,"Yeah, I like a lot of the actors they've got for that show, so I'm really looking forward to it. Might save it to binge it though"
3326,Big dinners are always a great way to tie everything up at the end of the day. Was it a pretty long day for you?
3327,"Haha I bet! Always great to have everyone together, though, really gets your mind off all the stresses of daily life."
3328,I'm sorry. Are you sure you did that bad?
3329,They'll be other interviews.
3330,What shows are you thinking of specifically?
3331,I didn't realize it was ending? You must be disappointed.
3332,"Oh wow, I hope you are fine!"
3333,"Yikes. If I was you, I would get my own gun! Better to have it and not need it, then have not have it then need it!"
3334,payday is the best day! What are you doing to do?
3335,OH wow! I feel you there and it's totally worth it! If you have to sit- get a donut pillow to not sit on your tailbone.
3336,Oh that's horrible. Who's Brian Lawyer?
3337,"I've never heard of him, but that sucks. How'd he die?"
3338,Oh wow that's horrible.
3339,What is the name of it?
3340,I hear that stuff is bad for you.
3341,"Ohh no, were you pulled over wrongly?"
3342,How fast did they say you were going?
3343,Thats great news.
3344,That is great news.
3345,Did you really steal it or was it more like borrowing without asking first?
3346,Hmmmm. with no job and no way to pay it back I sure hope he can be understanding.
3347,What show was it?
3348,Oh. I've never seen that show. I know it has die hard fans though.
3349,That's a tough one. Do you eat out a lot? That's usually the culprit. I had to learn how to cook for myself so I could afford to live.
3350,"Oh man, that's doubly terrible! Yeah, if you can, you should try to make a budget and get better at cooking for yourself. Huge money saver, but I'm sure you already knew that. I hope it works for you, though."
3351,Those jobs are hard. You can always try it and see if you like it. I recommend a temp agency they often have nice desk jobs. Some even offer work from home jobs.
3352,MOst work requires multi tasking. Yes that is true. You sound like you already have a good head on your shoulders.
3353,that's terrible. Was it an expensive one?
3354,No kidding... Who goes out of their way to get a lawnmower? Like... Why risk getting arrested and going to jail for a lawnmower... Oh well... Humanity. Sorry to hear that happened to you.
3355,"I'm sorry to hear that, I hope he is in a better place now! How old was he?"
3356,"Oh wow, I can't imagine losing my dad at 67. I hope you make it through these hard times, stay strong!"
3357,Right on! That's cool to hear. Everyone likes to rag on older people driving. Glad to hear she's the exception. What kind of car does she drive?
3358,"Haha... That sounds awesome. Wish I could carpool with her. I hate driving, but it sounds like she loves it."
3359,I have a friend who plans ahead like that.  I'm a last minute gal.  I think you will be less stressed by planning ahead.
3360,"Not to mention enjoy the actual party, too!  Are you celebrating anything in particular?"
3361,"Oh my god, I would have been so embarrassed! How'd you react?"
3362,So you left work at lunch time? Did you come back or were you too ashamed?
3363,"Yeah, I mean things happen. Better to put it in the back of your head and keep trucking along."
3364,"Dang, a whole two weeks? Going anywhere, or just hanging out and really enjoying yourself at home?"
3365,That's a good way to do it. especially because it's easy to get those post-vacation blues. That's actually really smart
3366,Good to hear you're confident! I'm sure you'll do well if you've been studying.
3367,"You don't have to tell me, I know you'll ace it! You sound well prepared."
3368,"Yeah, everyone speeds. Terrible to get caught. Hopefully you weren't speeding in a neighborhood, were you?"
3369,"Yeah, I know. Adrenaline gets to you. You're human. At least you were doing it in a sort of safe way, it sounds like. Some cops are just out to get you."
3370,Don't go check it out. That never turns out well in horror movies. Bring a gun then or another person.
3371,I would do that! Or call a friend over- Get a weapon too.
3372,Yikes... sounds like they need to hire better people. Hopefully the noise isn't too loud in the morning
3373,Man.. Good luck with that. Sounds like it will be hard to fight them. But I hope it works out for you.
3374,That is lucky!
3375,I'm happy you got to avoid that!
3376,"Seriously? How? What was the mistake? Did you talk to him about it, or your boss?"
3377,That's sneaky... and hard to explain. I'm sorry you have to deal with that hard situation. What do you think you'll do about it?
3378,Wap you must be disgusted with the farting. were you mad? or are you used to this kind of situations?
3379,"Yes i do have 2 siblings, older brother and younger sister, but we dont fart in front of eachother, i love them!"
3380,Sounds like the good old days seemed more relaxing and care free.
3381,Oh man! I grew up on that cartoon too!
3382,Yeah... that's a tough one. I've pirated stuff before. Kind of how it goes as a poor college student. Maybe when you get older you can pay for things appropriately.
3383,"Hahaha... Good point. I understand. Some things are just more important, fair point. My fault on assuming your age."
3384,"That's awesome, the exact opposite is true for me. My little brother is just about to start his first year of college next month!"
3385,"Yes, I hope so. Well, I hope your brother can put his degree to good use and make some moolah!"
3386,Who knows.. I've dealt with slow internet all my life. Wish I could finally get a decent ISP.
3387,"Not really, especially since they vary sometimes by region. We should just move to Europe, I hear they have great internet there because they actually view it as important."
3388,I am so sorry to hear that. I assume lots of folks close to you have entered eternity lately?
3389,"sadly we all know that everyone and everything is going to die, but that is why we need to really live while we are able. Don't retreat. Embrace everyone who is close to you."
3390,"Thats so scary, do you believe in ghosts?"
3391,Hope it's a friendly one at least.
3392,"Haha.  Makes it hard to take care of business, and you'd think she'd get the hint from the locked door!  I would have sat longer ""just because."""
3393,Maybe her first class seat should be on the royal porcelain seat!
3394,You should put yourself out there and meet some new people.  Just start exploring the city and you are bound to meet others!
3395,It is.  It isn't healthy to be by yourself for too long.  Humans are social creatures!
3396,"Wow, no parent should ever abuse their children like that. Did you or anyone do anything?"
3397,Yea I totally understand where you're coming from. Hopefully someone nearby was able to call CPS or law enforcement.
3398,"Lol, what a bummer. What happened?"
3399,"Well there you go, at least you a got a positive out of a negative situation haha!"
3400,Where did this happen?
3401,"Oh wow, yeah that sounds gross! I agree with the wasted food too. There are starving people all around the world!"
3402,"Oh no, why were they closed?"
3403,"Im sorry, I know how much that stinks, like when you really really want Chickfila and its Sunday..."
3404,Why would you always get fake checks? That would drive me crazy.
3405,Well that was a surprise I bet.
3406,O really? Any specific reason for this fear?
3407,Flying scares a lot of people but it's safer then driving over all.
3408,I have to say that is a true blessing. I have a wonderful mother myself. Why do you say she is a good mom?
3409,She sounds like a wonderful person.
3410,"Oh really, congrats! yes when your kids acomplish something it is very happy for us parents!"
3411,"Thats so cool, do you have any othe children or just one? when you have more they are very competitive"
3412,He couldve killed you!
3413,I really hate bad drivers. 
3414,I know that can be hard.  How long has it been since you've been out with someone?
3415,"Yeah, alot of times you just have to be reminded why you broke up.  I know there is someone out there for you, just stay positive and they will come your way!"
3416,That must of been no fun.
3417,Hopefully she doesn't do it again.
3418,I'm not too fond of them myself. Why don't you like them?
3419,"Yeah, especially fire ants. Those are nasty little buggers."
3420,"Sweet, was it a difficult test?"
3421,"Yea, same, it's nice to be out of school. All that learning pays off though!"
3422,Yea that is the worst. I don't understand how it can comeout of here mouth
3423,I hope you just walked away dude. Nothing good can come of that. I bet you were furious.
3424,"Well, that escalated quickly. I'm hoping this is not real?"
3425,":( That is messed up, did he/she show any warning signs before their passing? It's not your fault by the way."
3426,Did you hurt your self?
3427,That wasn't nice of them.
3428,Sorry for the bad news.
3429,I know she will make it.
3430,Congratulations! What are you doing to prepare for it?
3431,That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of cake did you select?
3432,It probably stank a lot too.
3433,"You probably should have moved with a shovel of something, instead of running over it"
3434,I am too! I am really not a fan on how he is handling relations with Russia. What makes him annoying to you?
3435,I know right? Doesn't seem right. Especially with the whole Russian interference with the election.
3436,Me too! These kids in this house are driving me crazy.  They need to get back on a schedule.
3437,I think mine have two weeks left.
3438,Did you have a flashlight?
3439,Oh no. Ive only been once but it was great. What happened?
3440,That terrible. Were you able to get a refund?
3441,How old is she?
3442,Why not send her to summer camp?
3443,What was it about?
3444,What did you spend it on?
3445,What movie was it?
3446,I have never seen it.
3447,That would be scary! Can you imagine what the dmv is like? 
3448,That would be an amazing neighbor! I would be so worried!
3449,That is great. Everyone should be loyal to their spouse.
3450,Maybe you can renew your vows one day.
3451,He must of been crazy.
3452,"Yes, id he do it for money?"
3453,Good luck with that. Do you found yourself confortable in your new job?
3454,I understand
3455,"Holy moly, that must've been a very depressing sight. Did the police end up finding the culprit?"
3456,I do hope nothing of value was stolen. I would be frantic if someone stole my family heirlooms.
3457,The visit would be the best gift ever and the paint job a huge bonus.
3458,How far did they have to travel?
3459,What job are you going to get?
3460,What did you use to do for work?
3461,I think he annoys most people.
3462,His tweets are rude and ill informed and he never apologizes for anything.
3463,I bet you were starving! Did they say why they were so late? 
3464,Did you get it free? I would be so annoyed!
3465,"Aw man, I've been there before. Has anyone tried using it?"
3466,That really sucks. Fortunate to hear that no one misused it though. They are typically pretty fast at sending you a new one.
3467,"Wow, that sounds unique. What exactly do you sell?"
3468,"Oh! Well duh, silly me. I thought it was food or something. Do you sell other things too?"
3469,Did you call the police?
3470,They will find who did it.
3471,Is he unable to take care of himself now?
3472,How caring of you.
3473,"That sucks, did you still have fun?"
3474,What did you bowl?
3475,She annoys me as well! She seemed pretty fraudulent in the last election.
3476,"Yes, especially for all those emails they found on her private server. Despicable."
3477,That is awesome! What subject was it in?
3478,I sure hope that you did. Statistics is tough!
3479,"I hear that, my friend. It ain't exactly easy living with mine, but ya gotta do it for love."
3480,It has to be enough - that's the whole reason why we seek out a soulmate. I do hope things get better.
3481,I love card games also.
3482,Yes I have won a few poker tournaments.
3483,"Oh man, why are you even still sending him money?"
3484,"Ahhh, so you're upset at your past self? We all make mistakes, man, it's good. What we think is good for us sometimes turns out to not be, but hindsight is twenty twenty."
3485,So much for them being up front for you. Man $300 for what thats a lot.
3486,"Yea construction zones are crazy, so often nooones there!"
3487,That would be exciting! What do you plan to do with your winnings? 
3488,That could lead to a gambling problem! I always run away with my winnings.
3489,"Yes, I hate that so much. The sound of screeching and crushing metal is traumatizing."
3490,"Unfortunately, yes. I had to get a few staples in my head but my car was totaled..."
3491,Smart move - it's always a swell idea to get ahead of work so that we can do the things we want to do in life.
3492,"Yup, I used to procrastinate all the time, but I think I am getting better at doing things ahead of time. And it feels so much better to get trivial things out of the way."
3493,"Aw man, that has to be rough. Were you guys really close?"
3494,That's even more saddening. Did you get to say somewhat of a goodbye to him at their funeral?
3495,Did you return the socks?
3496,That is mean.
3497,Me too but it is still one more month of heat coming but it also means September is on the way.
3498,Why do you say that?
3499,I don't like 100+ degree days myself!
3500,I like driving closer to the ground.
3501,"I could sure but I will be starting over on payments, I might look into it."
3502,"At the time it was a change and I like the ride of it, but I did not realize I would miss the sedan as much as I did."
3503,What do you have against the ole waterbug?
3504,That is terrifying indeed! I hoped you swatted that beast with the biggest fly swatter available.
3505,Congratulations. Are you excited?
3506,You'll do fine. I look at new things as adventures. 
3507,"That would be depressing, did you plan it yourself or did someone plan it for you?"
3508,"Maybe if you post to social media, a bunch of random strangers will show up."
3509,"Ouch, was it an unfair test or did he not study?"
3510,"Yea, hope he can make it up the rest of the year."
3511,"Ewww, throw that away ASAP."
3512,Throw it in your neighbor's trash can. I'm sure they would understand?
3513,What a nice gesture! What did you get to eat after not eating for so long?
3514,What kind of toppings did it have on it?
3515,Oh no! What was it?
3516,Yikes! I hope you didn't have any car damage.
3517,"I hate it when people laugh at me, it's so humiliating!"
3518,"Oh god, that's the worst part. The shame afterwards...."
3519,"Yea man, that's good karma!"
3520,Me too. Its always the worst when you are trying to get into the carpool line.
3521,That's awesome. I hope ro retire one day.
3522,What are you going to do now?
3523,What diet do you want to do?
3524,Make sure you drink water also.
3525,"I have never heard of an EDM, what is that?"
3526,Lol- sounds like fun! Nothing better than nice hippies!
3527,What does a caregiver do?
3528,"Oh, I see. Your mom is an angel!"
3529,What happened to him?
3530,So sorry to hear that.  I hope that the pain fades with time.
3531,"Oh what a disapointment, well you can keep saving, does it hurts too much?"
3532,"Oh ok i get it, well you just will have to save longer, thanks God its painless!"
3533,I am sorry to hear that.
3534,I hope you had fun with her.
3535,"Same, I need someone else to watch horror movies with me."
3536,"Hahaha, you are very adamant I see."
3537,That is so sweet. I want a puppy. and a boyfriend.
3538,Why did you break up?
3539,"oh I do too, they must have been having a bad day"
3540,yeah I guess so what did they do to you?
3541,"Oh lord, you might make me vomit right now!"
3542,You totally aren't sorry. You are being super gross! lol. TMI
3543,"That sucks. I've been nearly broke too several times but thank god for family, right?"
3544,What happened if you don't mind me asking?
3545,They are really nice cars! Have you driven one?
3546,They are nice looking cars and I have heard are great to off road in!
3547,That's not cool. Did you put your name on it?
3548,"I'm so sorry that happened to you, better luck next time."
3549,Oh no. Why do you think that happened? 
3550,Maybe you should slow down and only drink a bit at a time. 
3551,"I feel you on that, man. I get nostalgic all the time. What do you miss the most?"
3552,"Haha, yea, no one ever tells you how bad it really is. We get charged for every little thing."
3553,"When I was younger, but yes"
3554,Was she okay? Couldnt have been that bad
3555,Woman lol
3556,"Yeah, I hate that. Sometimes people will leave their carts right in the middle, blocking everyone while they walk off grabbing what they need. So annoying."
3557,I guess they have never heard of a personal bubble.
3558,I am not someone who likes that but I
3559,I'm sorry it submitted early. But I'd love to hear why it excites you?
3560,true! Thank you- It is very real
3561,"Ouch, did it make you late to work?"
3562,That's great to know there are still good people in this world.
3563,I bet! Could you see yourself walking around?
3564,I bet that brought back a lot of memories! 
3565,Why? Are you from New York?
3566,"Nice, do you play football too?"
3567,What kind of gamer?
3568,I love video games. 
3569,That was very mean of him.
3570,That is great! Always nice to see a good dad for once
3571,Can you give me an example?
3572,What's the Braves?
3573,"Okay cool, I'm not that big into sports. "
3574,They must of been so proud.
3575,Who gave them to you?
3576,Who got them for you?
3577,Are you quitting your job?
3578,That will be a nice change of pace! Do you have plans for retirement? 
3579,I hate that too. Have you ever noticed that's what they do in movies?
3580,I have seen them leave whole foods in movies. gross
3581,"I wish there would be, but I very much doubt that there will."
3582,"I do to, but there are so many unhappy people in the world and they seem to think they have to make everyone else around them unhappy."
3583,"Oh nice, I don't really watch football."
3584,I haven't really watched it on TV but my family watches it sometimes.
3585,Did you fix it?
3586,How many hours did you put into it.
3587,I sadly have no musical skill.  Do you think you will ever become a musician?
3588,What part of being a musician appeals to you?
3589,Life can be tough sometimes. It almost seems like you spend more time preparing for the unexpected than living life in the present. It's cruel sometimes
3590,"It's always good to have happiness even in times of worry and panic. So, I'm glad you still have some optimism!"
3591,Wow! Did you report him to the police?
3592,Sounds like that person has boundary issues. My ex's brother did that bother and I quickly nipped that behavior in the bud. Good on you for stopping that. Is he in too drugs or something or just entitled?
3593,Omg. I was devastated I grew up listening to him.
3594,I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little.
3595,What can you win?
3596,How much is a ticket?
3597,It was really sad. He was a really good artist.
3598,That would be awesome. I bet it was a really great concert.
3599,Why did he not graduate?
3600,Did he go to college?
3601,"Oh no, well I'm sure you'll do okay if you just prepare really thoroughly. "
3602,"I hope so too, good luck!"
3603,Thats a bummer. Maybe you can take it to a repair shop.
3604,Im sure they can figure something out. They might be able to remove the harddrive to recover the photos.
3605,Oh my god! Have you posted everywhere and checked shelters?
3606,Oh no! Did she have a microchip?
3607,That must be so frustrating.
3608,Yes it is. I would be furious!
3609,Im very sorry to hear that. hopefully it will get better with time.
3610,Im sure she is in a better place. Looking down on you.
3611,I hope you do well. What do you think?
3612,Does the job come with more pay?
3613,Good luck to you!
3614,Do you ever try to call the police?
3615,Well do you try to catch them lol? Thats insane We have a dog poop problem at my apartments
3616,I would just throw the bottles back at them
3617,"Oh yes, I bet the bosses love them too right? That happens a lot. Very unfair"
3618,Oh geez- work on your side hustle and get out of there. I did a long time ago. Hate those jobs!
3619,You are very lucky. I have 4 children and I have been lucky also to have healthy children.
3620,I know what you mean. I am always so sad when I see all of these sick children on tv.
3621,I would be so happy if they could find a cure for cancer.
3622,Wow. Can she handle all of that?
3623,Thats awesome. She will do great in college.
3624,That sounds awesome!
3625,"I'm glad that worked out for you, it could have gone in a completely different way."
3626,Yay you! I hope your next project turns out just as good.
3627,"Oh no that is so sad to hear! I have one dog and two cats, so I totally understand what you are going through..."
3628,"Aww what a cute name. Hopefully you an your Mom made up, and maybe you got/can get another pet."
3629,Oh no! I know it stinks but maybe one day you can forgive her- I hope...
3630,"Oh no, I hope it was for a good reason"
3631,Oh man! It's hard when those accidents happen.
3632,That's great! I hope it goes well for you!
3633,"Dang, I would have been so upset too. "
3634,It would have sucked more if it was raining. Hopefully you have some good vibes come your way.
3635,I bet. You guys were together for so long. Is this for the best?
3636,Well I am sorry to hear that. If you need anyone to talk to let me know.
3637,"was? that almost makes it sound like you didnt graduate or something went wrong, did you graduate?"
3638,"Nope, unfortunately not, i was hoping to at one point but it never worked out. What did you study? "
3639,"medicine and/or nursing, initially also liked psychiatry but then realised that its history is full of abuse and horror, some of which still is ongoing so i didnt want to participate in that. What can one use a business management degree for? Do you literally become a manager in some business or how does that work?"
3640,"Oh no, Im so sorry! They probably already filled the position and it didnt have to do with you personally!"
3641,Yeah! People tend to be lazy and not take down the posting once they have filled the position and the automated emails will send a canned response instead. 
3642,Sorry to hear that. Did you have trouble getting the extra precautions?
3643,"Well, I hope everything turns out okay for you."
3644,i have
3645,Irma last year
3646,How much was it?
3647,"Wow, that's a lot, what type of vehicle?"
3648,how many of them were tehre
3649,What color were they ?
3650,"Well, transportation is very important.  take some old clothing and cut it up if you have to ."
3651,"Tissue is so expensive, it's unbelievable"
3652,"I do as well, how long does it take you to do it?"
3653,"that makes sense, but I guess everyone needs food!"
3654,Yeah? Who were they playing against?
3655,I think I remember watching it. How old were you then?
3656,It's a boon for everyone. Great life period is childhood.
3657,"Yeah, whenever I miss my childhood I try to spend the time with the kids. So we can feel better."
3658,"I know, but now we have another kind of football season coming up soon"
3659,"Me too, I am so excited, since the Eagles just won last year!"
3660,That happens sometimes. Maybe you should take a break
3661,what kind of food do they serve?
3662,"I do too, TN, but I can't think of a soul food place here."
3663,cookeville
3664,Its summer vacation. I hope you got enough sleep or it might be a long day for you.
3665,Oh ok I see. Im sure he will want a nap later. Hopefully that gives you time to recharge a little.
3666,I'm sorry to hear that. I lost mine recently also.
3667,That must be hard. 
3668,I know what you mean. It's not safe to send your kids out now.
3669,I have to take my kids to parks outside of our neighborhood.
3670,"I know that feeling, that is no fun, but at least they are learning!"
3671,"That is good, that is a nice way to make a bit of extra money!"
3672,I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you spend a lot of time with her?
3673,That's terrible.  I hope she's at least at peace now.
3674,I never really got into pokemon.
3675,I tried to do the mobile game but I didn't get it lol
3676,Oh really? How much did you win?
3677,"Hey that is nothing to sneeze at, I would take that in a heartbeat"
3678,Really? Have you got a large family?
3679,But you are all very close knit then?
3680,"That must be fun, it is so cute watching kids try to read books for some reason"
3681,"Yeah, kids are just so adorable, watching them learn in front of your eyes is an awesome privelege "
3682,That's awesome. What was your major.
3683,You'll do great. Your parents must really b proud.
3684,Oh no. That may ruin the walls.
3685,Hopefully she learns her lesson. 
3686,What is it called? I may tune in!
3687,"Oh, I have hulu, I need to look into that!"
3688,What is you job now?
3689,Oh. Well keep looking. You will find something soon.
3690,That is really scary. Hydroplaning is something you can really do nothing about
3691,It happens really quickly. You forget everything then.
3692,"Oh, you're starting up again soon, too? Me too. I'm excited and a little bit unexcited. Will be good to have a schedule, but worried about being able to do school and earn money to pay rent. What are you majoring in?"
3693,"Hey, that's pretty cool! I'm majoring in social work. Those both are close alternatives to social work that I gave some thought to. Sometimes I think I should have done criminology, but oh well. I hope you enjoy your semester."
3694,have you grown out of it ?
3695,well thats a good start
3696,"That is obnoxious, I would switch just to stick it to them"
3697,"that is terrible, that is not a good way to keep people"
3698,Glad for you. I have broken up with mine after 3 years of being together
3699,It was her who initiated the first move for us to split our ways. She said she was not feeling happy with me
3700,"I would be more than jealous, but maybe I am not super sane about that kind of thing"
3701,"That is probably true, but the stories we hear do not help"
3702,I'm sorry to hear that. Did she pass away recently?
3703,Yeah. It is difficult when you lose someone you're close to.
3704,"that is a perfect time to go, that is when I went as well"
3705,"It sure did, it was the best vacation I have ever been on"
3706,"Was he just playing tricks on you, to get you to laugh? Or was he being malicious about it? "
3707,"Yeah, sometimes dads forget how young kids are and just do what they think is funny. My dad wasn't the best either at understanding how fragile kids can be. But he was still a good da"
3708,"That is scary, I was in that position before, I do not know why they make it so difficult"
3709,"Still, school is about making mistakes and learning from them"
3710,"Nothing wrong with that, it's the unknown that scares us all."
3711,I'd try not to be too down on myself over it.
3712,My daughters started back to school today.
3713,"It's good, but I'm a little nervous for them. I know they'll be fine."
3714,"i agree on all terms, without family we dont mean much in the world"
3715,of course
3716,"That is not cool, I would cancel immediately"
3717,"Oh, yeah you should definitely cancel in that case"
3718,That's lucky!  Did he get hurt from his shoes breaking mid game?
3719,Oh no!  I hope it didn't effect his team too much.
3720,"that is pretty normal, so do i"
3721,"those days will not ever come again, we have to live with it"
3722,who are we talking about?
3723,"Oh, I am sorry to hear that!"
3724,"That is no fun, leave the kids at home for stuff like that!"
3725,Yeah - is it a reboot of the old version from years ago?
3726,"Oh cool - I haven't played all of them, but did playthe first one."
3727,"I'm not familiar with that, tell me more."
3728,"That sounds like fun, which game platform?"
3729,"That is awesome, I am very much the opposite, hat is a great skill!"
3730,"Wow those are not easy to learn either, good job raising them!"
3731,"oh, what happened?"
3732,oh that's bad. I feel sorry for you.
3733,Small things like what?
3734,"Ah, well for some people, that is a very big thing!"
3735,that sure is a lot of savings
3736,did you check ebay ? its cheaper tehre
3737,How small is small?
3738,That's not bad. I want a 75 inch but I'm settling at 55 for now lol
3739,"Oh, well i hope the tides turn for you soon!"
3740,when is the release date
3741,"just in time for the holidays, nintendo is smart"
3742,Congrats! I bet that feels great!
3743,"oh, tell him not to feel nervous. He worked very hard indeed."
3744,Oh that's great! good for you him!
3745,"Oh no, what happened?"
3746,"That's not good. Maybe they are trying to protect them better, but haven't figured out a good plan"
3747,"Wow that is not cool, why not tell your parents?"
3748,"Ah okay, well that makes a big difference"
3749,i am excited for you
3750,will you be playing it a lot ?
3751,"that is great, that is a dream come true for a lot of people!"
3752,"I understand that, it can leave a large void, my mom used to be like that too"
3753,It can be hard. I went through that myself.
3754,We have to deal with it and try to move on. 
3755,How good. I think you like it a lot
3756,to me likewise I find it a super fun game
3757,thats what the love and family bond i think
3758,accepting .. but not in my case.. you are lucky i guess
3759,Notified of what?
3760,"Ah, that makes sense"
3761,That's always a bad thing about having to work with others.  What kind of issues do they have?
3762,The worst kind.  I bet they think they know what they need to do and get really annoyed when you try to help.
3763,about what?
3764,I am sorry? I do not understand
3765,no iam here dude
3766,yeah me tooo. then how was your day today?
3767,"Okay, I'm feeling nostalgic about my childhood."
3768,"it was a long time ago, but I still remember it well."
3769,ok thank you bye
3770,4
3771,"Friends help us in difficult times, thank God we have them"
3772,I hope you overcome that situation with the help of your friends
3773,That really sucks... did you tell them how that made you feel? 
3774,I would tell them.. and if it happens a 2nd time then they arent very good friends to have! :/
3775,Oh wow! That's great. Did she say how it went?
3776,"Hired the same day though...she must have done really well, despite being nervous!"
3777,Sounds like hard work has been paying off for you.
3778,That is always a good feeling. I love when I am on top of things.
3779,That's awesome.
3780,I bet that warmed your heart. My old friends won't even drive across the city for me. We always meet downtown.
3781,I went through that for like 5 years.  Ended up finally going and they've made a lot of advances in comfort since I last went before that.
3782,"Yeah, you should definitely bite the bullet (metaphorically).  It'll only get worse from here if you don't do anything, and it probably won't be as bad as you worry."
3783,Thats great! How many do you have?
3784,Wonderful! What kind of instruments do they play?
3785,Are you better now?
3786,That's so nice to have someone to depend on.
3787,That is so annoying. Do you check the bag before arriving home at least?
3788,Its the worst. I would complain to management. You cant be the only one it happens to.
3789,I hope so too! Waiting for the call back is so nerver wrecking.
3790,"Take your mind off of it and before you know it, you'll be filling out new hire paperwork!"
3791,"The strength remains us the prayer, it helps us to get ahead"
3792,Well ... God is in the hands of your doctors
3793,Are you going to go out alone or with the family? vacation?
3794,"Well, I hope you have a lot of fun in contact with nature"
3795,Oh my god. That is horrifying.
3796,"I rescue animals, it's best not to let cats wander outside. So many bad things could happen."
3797,yes! That can happen around any bigger dog. We had a foster dog do it. It is horrible! So sorry for your loss. I have lost many this past year. Accidents happen. 
3798,You are not! I let my cats outside but supervised. Yes it's hard if they love it. You can get a special cat fence :) 
3799,I can understand that. Was there a reason one color was chosen for her and another for you?
3800,"Sounds like you wanted to be the same as your cousin and not set apart. It may seem trivial now, but I know it wasn't trivial to you at the time."
3801,It must be hard being apart. Just know he will return a better person most likely.
3802,He will need your support when he gets back. Just stay strong and know its for the best.
3803,Wonderful! Congratulations! What are you going in too college for?
3804,You sure can! Hard work is required to get something of value.
3805,:( I am so sorry to hear that... how old was she? 
3806,She lived a long life for a cat but its never long enough for us who they leave behind. I hope you feel better soon... 
3807,It really is bad everywhere and the bullying policies don't help. 
3808,Yes it is. It makes me want to homeschool.
3809,Wow! had she ever won before?
3810,Sometimes those things happen just when we need them. It would be nice if they happened for extra money too! lol
3811,You definitely can! What are your plans?
3812,That's true. I wish you the best of luck!
3813,I congratulate you on your children .... That says a lot about you as a father o mother
3814,"We need good parents, that will make the world more human"
3815,Mistakes happen but it's good you are learning from it. We all make mistakes
3816,Maybe it will be just what you need though. Time to really concentrate and learn and grow within yourself as an individual :) Maybe you will have a nice romance too
3817,That is very kind of you. You should take it to the vet for a check up.
3818,I takes a special kind of person to do what you are doing. Im sure that dog is already much happier in your care. 
3819,Oh no... yikes have you told your friend yet? 
3820,well thats good of you! too bad it happened :/ but glad shes not upset 
3821,That's nice to hear! What's going on?
3822,Wow. Those are 2 fantastic news!
3823,Sounds like you have a wonderful family. Some people take it for granted.
3824,I've had those experiences as well. My family is also very precious to me. 
3825,The weirdest thing... it sucks when you dont know whats causing it. Has she been to an eye doctor or just a general dr? 
3826,sounds like a good idea i hope her pain goes away asap! 
3827,You can. It will take some persistence. How's it going so far?
3828,Oh that's like the reverse pregnancy. When the husband gains the weight!
3829,wow! that's so amazing. I bet you are so proud of him
3830,I bet! What a bright young man you raised!
3831,Oh no. Have you made plans on what you're going to do to take care of them?
3832,It sounds like a tough situation. I feel for ya.
3833,Does she live far away from you?
3834,How often do you get to see her?
3835,how interesting. What country she is at now?
3836,I think England is a pretty safe country. That will be so much fun when you go there
3837,Oh man. I am sorry. Your time will come. That is a very hard situation! One of those hard ones in life.
3838,Maybe you should ask your boss? Maybe he is more charasmatic. That happens sometimes. I am sorry. I've been there!
3839,That is so generous. Sounds like she has found her calling in life.
3840,I hope she is getting the donations she needs to keep doing this.
3841,I agree with that.  That animal is probably very lucky because of you.
3842,"It has already taken its first steps towards independence, that is something big"
3843,is achieved at a steady pace ... it fills us with hope and happiness
3844,Thats a bummer. What do you do there?
3845,Oh nice! Good for you. Maybe go for a run?
3846,Wow. What gripe does your aunt have with your mom?
3847,Those kinds of people usually have the worse self-esteem. 
3848,Woohoo! That is amazing. hope it came with some great benefits.
3849,Hey sometimes thats even better. More financial stability is great.
3850,Must have been really nostalgic. Did you think about going to play on that field again?
3851,"Childhood seems to be a great time for most, but then we wanted to grow up too fast."
3852,I bet you feel great too.
3853,That is awesome. Congrats!
3854,I'm sorry to hear that.  Tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with.  
3855,"Going isn't fun, but unfortunately it's necessary some times. I hope you feel better soon."
3856,you did the right thing... do you foster them or are they yours since kittens? 
3857,really kind of you! 
3858,Oh my god. You shouldn't just get over it- it is not right. Betrayal is something no one should do to another.
3859,"Wow! It's always nice when life works out well, especially if the person deserves it."
3860,That is hard! I am glad she sees her worth and is going to get more education.
3861,That's some great police workforce your town has. (sarcasm)
3862,"Wow, What state is this in?"
3863,That is awesome!  What are you going to do?
3864,That is very brave.  I a sure you will do great!
3865,What does? Were you in a car ride with your aunt?
3866,"Oh you're an 80s kids, hu? What do you feel about the music nowadays?"
3867,Is it something that commits you a lot?
3868,ahh ... then you have to support it
3869,That really sucks
3870,I always hate when work gets in the way of having friends. It's always one way or the other.  If it's not your schedule it's theirs
3871,"Cool. Did he thank the ""little people""?"
3872,That's good. Sometimes bosses think they do it all by themselves.
3873,That is great.  you must be so proud
3874,That is really impressive considering summer is really tough to learn that!
3875,"Great, are you taking anyone with you?"
3876,That should be a very fun trip for you.
3877,Oh god. How big was it?
3878,"Man, that's scary. Is it out now?"
3879,"What?! You should ask them for a free upgrade, because that's not cool."
3880,That's awful. Try asking for the manager next time. 
3881,Getting away is definitely needed sometimes.
3882,Are you vacationing somewhere nearby or somewhere else?
3883,That is disappointing.  What kind of laptop is it?
3884,I know how that is.  Good luck with your search!
3885,I know. Sometimes it's hard to have some left over after bills. What are you saving for?
3886,"Yea, it is a lot of expenses people don't prepare for soemtimes."
3887,Why did you leave?
3888,It's rare to find a place where everyone gets along. I hope your new job is still nice?
3889,"Yea, but I try not to compare. It'll just make me feel bad. What about you?"
3890,Wow. How does one get a new car every month. Must be loaded.
3891,That's great.  True freedom!
3892,I will get there one day.
3893,Is it a well paying one?
3894,"stabilize things first, then save regularly."
3895,That's awesome. You must feel really relieved.
3896,Do you tend to have a lot of work?
3897,Woo hoo! Thats awesome. Losing weight can be so hard!
3898,Thats the way to do it! keto has helped me a lot. Yes a lifestyle change versus a diet.
3899,"Wow, go mom! Is she always such a sweetheart?"
3900,I hope you guys let her know how appreciated she is!
3901,Yikes! What did he do to deserve that kind of punishment?
3902,Oh man! You're right for punishing him. Theft is very bad!
3903,"That's great!  I've been meaning to, but haven't had the time."
3904,Have you lost any weight over ht epast month?
3905,WOW! I just found one dog and I thought that is rough. Are you fostering them now?
3906,Wonderful! Rescues will help you with contracts and getting them fixed if you need help. Fix those babies up :) Thanks for keeping them safe!
3907,She sounds like a wonderful person. People who try to help defenseless animals are really special.
3908,She sounds wonderful. I'd definitely want to be friends with someone like that.
3909,That is hilarious! Was it embarrassing or funny at the time?
3910,I can understand that
3911,"That's great. Sometimes co-workers can be hit or miss. When you get good ones, it's awesome."
3912,Is that something your work arranges?
3913,Have you tried rewarding him when he does?
3914,It is great to have more time with the kids.
3915,MY first work from home was stressful I had to send the kids to daycare. Not anymore!
3916,Uhoh.  Was it work appropriate?
3917,Oh no.  When will you have to talk to your boss?
3918,Wow. I bet he is tired all the time. I drink coffee all day for energy
3919,"Yeah, it's very important to finish school so you don't have to work three jobs just to survive."
3920,Oh no! That's so sad.
3921,I don't think they know where they're going. Probably just trying to get home.
3922,Oh I used to love babysitting... depending on the child haha. How do you feel about it?
3923,I understand where you're coming from. I would probably feel the same way in your shoes.
3924,Oh? What's your new gig?
3925,"That does sound pretty good. I mean, working from home is great, but doing it on your own time is way better."
3926,Lol. That's funny. Better hope you dont end up on YouTube.
3927,You will be the talk of the break room.
3928,Being single isn't all that bad. Are you looking for someone?
3929,Better to be single than be with weirdos.
3930,How can you tell if a cactus is dead?
3931,I've never seen that before
3932,that's very kind. Many people wouldn't go out of their way to do that.
3933,We need more people like you. The world would be a better place.
3934,That sounds like a good lunch! I love Taco Bell
3935,"That is definitely good, I am not that fortunate! "
3936,That's pretty nice of you. Has she had any interviews?
3937,I know the feeling. It can be hard getting back out there.
3938,Why? What do they do?
3939,People can be so lazy and inconsiderate of others.
3940,That will be sad. Are you going to get to go again before then?
3941,"Take lots of pictures, so you can remember it!"
3942,Must've been a really difficult exam. Will there be other exams to balance it out?
3943,I guess the teacher wasn't going to listen to you? That sucks.
3944,That sounds great! Any particular cuisine in mind?
3945,Oh I love those. They always have great selections and the desserts aren't bad either.
3946,I hope it goes well!
3947,try to get some rest beforehand.
3948,"Woah, did she say she was coming back? She's awfully trusting."
3949,"Totally, and I bet most people would walk off with it. I have no faith in humanity."
3950,Are you the parent or the teacher? I get nervous meeting anyone new
3951,I felt like that when my kids were younger. Doesn't feel like that now they're teenagers. It'll be ok just act natural
3952,That was nice. IDid they have to start it over?
3953,Did she hurt herself?
3954,That's great to hear. What's going on?
3955,That sounds really great. Happy for ya.
3956,Wow. That's a great accomplishment. I hope to buy a house soon.
3957,I don't stretch myself too thin. I know I'm far from rich.
3958,"Oh no, that sucks. What happened at court?"
3959,Jesus. That's terrible. I hope you get a breather from that.
3960,That was so nice of them to do such a thing.
3961,I bet it is. When things like that happen it makes you really value where you work. Makes it enjoyable.
3962,Do you guys not get together often anymore?
3963,You all can still spend time together separately even if you can't all be together. Have to make it work.
3964,"That's great to hear! If you don't mind me asking, what happened?"
3965,"Still, that's still great. You better knock on some wood though, just in case. Don't jinx it!"
3966,I know the feeling. At least you made it.
3967,Three hours though. I don't think I would've made it.
3968,Oh no. what happened?
3969,If only people were more considerate of others. It's not just them in the world.
3970,Are they grown up now? They grow up so fast.
3971,hahaha I bet there are.
3972,Cool. I've never been camping.
3973,I would be afraid of animals and bugs I think.
3974,That happens sometimes. Maybe next year.
3975,I took my kids to the beach and now every time we leave the house they ask if that's where we are going. 
3976,Well it's 9 hours away so we probably won't go until next year either lol
3977,Did you get lucky and some kind person turn it in
3978,That is horrible. Just think it could have been worse. You could have wrecked and totaled a car or a house burnt. Lots of things are worse.
3979,Glad for you. A girl I know was walking to her house and a car hit her and killed her. So it's just money and can be replaced
3980,"Yes, we are here for just a short time"
3981,OMG. I would have been so scared.
3982,Did it get away or bite you?
3983,With what?
3984,"Well, you're popular then at least."
3985,that actually makes sense to me.
3986,Did you notice any funny glances from anyone?
3987,Did you taste anything funny from the lipstick?
3988,That sounds great! Did you just get out of a rough relationship?
3989,"Oh gosh, I'm sorry to hear that. Hang in there, there's a lot of great guys out there."
3990,"probably, time to get the traps and get rid of it."
3991,going to have to do something...call somebody to help you.
3992,huh?
3993,That happens sometimes. Is it like that this time of year?
3994,will it pick up soon?
3995,Why have you been lazy?
3996,What kind of work is it?
3997,Oh nice! Are you taking any cool classes?
3998,How exciting! The first day of school is always so fun. 
3999,Hope they don't find out.  Were you just tired or something else?
4000,"Well, next time try telling her the truth, like , I am too tired right now, can we do it another day. and that way you won't feel bad."
4001,I'm sure she would understand if she is a good friend.
4002,"I bet it will be a good dinner, since there is some guilt involved. lol"
4003,That's true. I'm glad I live in an apartment.
4004,"Lol. I think that's more hard work, but you'd only have to do it once lol"
4005,What's the model/make
4006,Dang that is a pretty slick ride...how close are you to buying one
4007,I really hate that!
4008,Some people are so petty.
4009,Does that still happen? I can relate...it was a relief to go on vacation and get away from them.
4010,That's great. I went to Europe for a while and came back to the more of the same stomping around above my head. It was a dream to get away.
4011,Wow. That's exciting!
4012,Its not that bad. I'll get to Europe one day lol
4013,I dread that it will go so quickly!
4014,What do you do during the day?
4015,What were you standing on? Just the ground?
4016,Are those by Kanye West? Not hip with the lingo.
4017,"I have heard water is expensive in California. Well , they are worth it if you can jump straight up five or six feet."
4018,"I might be able to do that, not sure."
4019,Oof that sucks. Sorry about that. I dont like cutting my grass so my front door is covered in pink papers from city citations. oof
4020,Nothing like redneck engineering. Did you use Flex tape.
4021,"Oh darn I really like those infomercials, wanted to know how the stuff worked."
4022,Actually it costs 15 dollars where I'm located.
4023,"you like it a lot, now what does it do?"
4024,of Mike Tyson
4025,"I hate when that happens, and they tell you to come early too."
4026,"Seems fair, they don't value your time it seems like."
4027,It is always nice to be able to rely on friends when you need them most.
4028,I hope the party turned out to be a great success because of his help.
4029,"Oh no, I couldn't imagine! I'm so sorry!"
4030,Yeah and how easy life was? i wish we could atleast have 1 day a year like that but to actually feel as free as them! 
4031,Idk ourselves maybe? lol :D
4032,Do you mind talking about it specifically?
4033,haha well that's a pleasant surprise...what kind of car
4034,That is such a beautiful memory to have. I love that we forever have moments like this... How cool Hong Kong! 
4035,I do actually quite a few mainly old country songs like daddys hands is a big one super oldie! :) 
4036,Do you have a past traumatic experience?
4037,Sorry to hear that.  I'm positive you'll be smart about your lifestyle choices though
4038,Some things like that you wont ever forget thats pretty rad 
4039,you should do it again just for the heck of it 
4040,Sometimes I feel the same as you ... but I get up and move on
4041,That's right ... I wish I could do that ... disconnect
4042,Did you stub your toe?
4043,Oh no! That's even worse! Did you puke a little? I would've thrown up!
4044,What did he say? 
4045,"Always good to trust your spouse, but I would be on the fence a bit and have my eye out too. "
4046,That is pretty bad situation he is in. I feel little mad myself too.
4047,Yeah i would say the same to him too man.
4048,When did you start getting better
4049,That's pretty cool
4050,How old is he? I really hope its nothing serious :/ 
4051,wow that really is TOO young! Lets hope its nothing serious. He will get thru it regardless. 
4052,What is it?
4053,I can tell! Are you doing anything special for it?
4054,Are you going to be okay
4055,I am glad you are okay
4056,"That doesn't seem fair, I  hope they changed their ways eventually."
4057,"That's unfortunate, I wonder if he's forgiven them?"
4058,thats so sweet i bet she is how old is she? 
4059,omg i cant wait to see what that feels like as a parent congrats! 
4060,"Oh no, please tell me what's going on! Can I help?"
4061,"That's the worst, I'm sure it was an annoyance!"
4062,Nice I can relate.  How old were you when you moved out
4063,"That's cool. I was 17 when I first moved out.  Now I'm 26, fully self-employed and hang out with whoever I want to.  But I had to have a lot of faith in myself"
4064,That is pretty great! I like it when you can wake up and not care about stuff.
4065,That is pretty awesome! I wish i could do stuff like that.
4066,Did he get it for you for a specific reason or just because?
4067,That's so kind of him! What a dad!
4068,I am sure you will love it
4069,"I am sure you will, good luck"
4070,Why do you feel bad about yourself?  I am sure whatever it is can't be that horrible.
4071,"Even if you feel you voted for the wrong person, you shouldn't worry.  You will be able to vote for a new person in a couple years!"
4072,Good luck! I have faith on you.
4073,I am sure you are going to excell
4074,I love that as well!  Nothing better than unexpected cash!  Has this happened to you recently?
4075,Awesome!  Congrats to you on that unexpected windfall!
4076,I think you should get out and explore.  I'm in a similar situation--moved to South Texas with zero connections/family to jumpstart my business...and I've met some pretty amazing people
4077,You definitely will trust me
4078,That happen to me frequently. Did your manager said anything because you are late?
4079,It can be annoying
4080,I am sorry to hear that.  How long has he been promising you the promotion?
4081,I can imaging.  He sounds pretty spineless and shady.
4082,Why did they do tha
4083,I am sorry that happened to you
4084,Family is very important.
4085,"The same for me, i try to keep them close."
4086,Why do you think that?
4087,What will be her major?
4088,"Do you? You should trust her, that's what marriage is about!"
4089,"That's awful, I'm sorry."
4090,I am really sorry.Do you have house insurance?
4091,Do you have a place to stay for a while?
4092,Yes...but in what context
4093,Nice that's pretty smart...always go with your instincts
4094,Yeah....But his daughter is doing pretty well at least almost ending up like him.
4095,Well she is still pretty young and learning to handle animals probably be like her father sooner or later./
4096,"Well, that't not your fault at all. It's your scumbag significant other's fault. You shouldn't feel ashamed for the crummy thing he did - you did nothing wrong."
4097,If he's not meeting your standard then it's time to find a new boyfriend - even if that's the hard thing to do. You shouldn't ever lower your standards.
4098,"Oh my gosh no, are you feeling okay?"
4099,Are you taking medicine for that? Do you have heartburn or do you feel gluttonous?
4100,I would love that too
4101,That wont be too hard
4102,Sorry to hear that. Is he better now?
4103,Did the doctors have found what was the issue with his heart?
4104,That's pretty cool. What flavor do you think you are going to get?
4105,Berry sounds like it would be very tasty.
4106,"Whoa, did anything bad happen? "
4107,"I'm glad nothing bad happen, snake venom can really mess you up..."
4108,How did you feel about that
4109,"I know the feeling.  Just broke up with my ex-gf 5 months ago.  But he/she is out there, chin up :)"
4110,"Wow good luck, I'm a big fan of watching MMA myself."
4111,"Oh oops, my fault for assuming. Definitely an intense experience either way as you said."
4112,"Ugh, I did the same thing today! I'm going to have to start making fresh cups in the morning and afternoon."
4113,Can't go wrong with a spittoon. And it makes a nice conversation piece when you have visitors over.
4114,That's awesome! Was it your birthday?
4115,Your friends care a lot of you and that's always a great feeling! I hope you had fun!
4116,"Oh no, are you okay"
4117,I hate being that drunk
4118,"Dang, that's kinda hurtful. Why did you miss the wedding?"
4119,I've had those days before. I would just take it as a lesson and try to control your drinking next time when important events are in the near future.
4120,How long did it take to prepare for?
4121,"Aw, sorry about that! Did you have a pet you could take there with you?"
4122,"Yeah, I have a dog and I take it to the park sometimes. It can help you feel less lonely for sure."
4123,"Dang, that's quite a large amount of money to lose. Hopefully it went to someone who needs it."
4124,That would be nice. Maybe he'll go and buy some candy from the candy store.
4125,I try not to have any friends.
4126,I advice not to trust anyone ever. Stay to yourself and be sad my friend.
4127,I do not want to be the first one.
4128,Well that isn't really pleasant i bet.
4129,Well hope you didn't have flashbacks of it too often.
4130,Best of luck! Have you won in the past?
4131,Wow you're pretty lucky...I can never win those things
4132,Are you a mother? It could be a maternal thing/instinct.
4133,"Oh, well you could still have protective traits as a male. How old is your cousin?"
4134,That's nice of your dad - it's sometimes hard to get a car on your own. What kind of truck is it?
4135,Nissan's are top of the line. I hope you get a lot of use out of it.
4136,What is the trick
4137,That is a good dog then
4138,"Aw, that sucks. Everyone gets old eventually, how old is she/he?"
4139,"That's good to hear, I hope he feels and gets better"
4140,"I think those people don't actually eat that much, it just seems like it though."
4141,If he's taller/bigger than you it would make sense if he doesn't gain any weight
4142,"That seems like a lot of pizza rolls, how do you feel?"
4143,"Hey, we all pig out at some point"
4144,That's too bad. It's nice to have friends to revel in our victories. Why don't you get yourself a beer and relax on the porch?
4145,"If you need someone to join in, just let me know!"
4146,I am sorry to hear that.  Any certain areas you think you could have done better on?
4147,Don't be so hard on yourself.  Most people can't even spell physics.
4148,Oh no what happened
4149,"I am sorry, I hope you find it"
4150,That's so sad to hear! How did she pass? If you don't mind me asking.
4151,"That's terrible, my friend. How are you holding up?"
4152,I love it when it rains.
4153,Sunny days are very hot and i do not like that.
4154,"Nice, I usually forget a thing or two. Did you get everything you needed?"
4155,I assume you were very prepared!
4156,What techniques have you learned so far though?
4157,I think you will do pretty well then in a street fight.
4158,Go on
4159,That's pretty cool.  Grew up with the Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance myself
4160,"Wow, that sucks. Did you try calling the grocery store?"
4161,Your neighbor is a good person. I would have...given it back to you haha.
4162,"I have a pesky, sneaky little dog like that too! Did you clean it up?"
4163,That's good. Was she guilty when she saw you cleaning it up?
4164,"That is disgusting, my dog does that too but in sneaky places. It's always a surprise lol"
4165,"Yeah, our dogs need to be punished and maybe trained more."
4166,Oh wow. Maybe they were busy doing other things? Did you find anyone else to play with?
4167,Sometimes playing by ourselves is how we get better.
4168,What kind of job
4169,I am sorry that happened
4170,Six Flags is such a fun park! Are you a fan of roller coasters?
4171,They are! Cedar Point has some gnarly roller coasters too.
4172,I love that too! Isn't it great!
4173,What are you planning on doing with your vacation time?
4174,What happened that day?
4175,Did any of you get hurt?
4176,"Wow, that's unfortunate. People don't realize that can happen but it happened to my friend when we were little."
4177,"Sorry to hear that, recovering from any pet lose is hard."
4178,Did you get attacked by a big dog when you were little?
4179,Maybe it was because you saw your brother get attacked by one and you are scared it might happen to you.
4180,Did you try to go to the grocery store to give it back?
4181,I understand.
4182,Sorry to hear that. How did she pass?
4183,"Man, very sorry to hear that. First your mom, now your aunt. Sounds like you have very unfortunate relatives."
4184,I do love to read as well
4185,That sounds so nice
4186,Holy moly! Sounds like you are eating well tonight!
4187,"Well, I'm sure you can find a recipe online that uses spent lottery tickets."
4188,Are you homeless?
4189,"Lol, I bet that a good looking sandwich then."
4190,"Oh, you will probably be just fine don't worry about it too much."
4191,Dentist aren't people focused on trying to hurt you.
4192,Ut oh.. What did you eat?
4193,Don't worry... you only live once!
4194,"I hate driving, I avoid it as much as possible. "
4195,Mine was from being in one and just being nervous about having to be in charge of things.
4196,Thats good to hear. Why do you thank god for her?
4197,Well thats nice. I thank god for my wife as well
4198,Well there are always bigger fish in the sea trust me.
4199,That is also very important to learn.
4200,"That sucks, do you feel better now?"
4201,"Yeah, isolation can happen when you get super sad. At least you are feeling better now"
4202,"That's always a positive in my book, what kind of food was it?  What were your reservations about the restaurant before going?"
4203,Is it in a bad part of town or is the building just bad luck or run down?
4204,"I am sorry, that sounds bad"
4205,Maybe it wont happen again
4206,Oh my gosh!  That must have been so embarrassing!
4207,Don't worry.  I'm sure you will never make that mistake again!
4208,"Aw, that sucks because money was the issue. Maybe she can take a bus or something?"
4209,Yay! I love happy endings
4210,Oh how scary! What happened?
4211,I am so sorry you had to see that. That is so bad. Did you have to call it in?
4212,Ouch! that stinks man why she do it?
4213,"That is even worse, Like why would someone just do that when commited to someone."
4214,Parties are some times very loud.
4215,If my friends did that I would have a heart attack.
4216,What movie are you referring too?
4217,Oh! Well i haven't seen that yet. was the action at least somewhat decent?
4218,Yeah I hate waiting for the results of a long term goal
4219,"Damn, you suck at soccer. Just kidding, good job!! lol"
4220,Oh no.. what happened?  Are you ok?
4221,What did you lie to him about?
4222,"I am sorry, he will stop eventually"
4223,He will get better
4224,"Wow, why does he need to drink so much?"
4225,"I'm sorry, I've dealt with something like that before and it can be very anger inducing."
4226,Did you do anything wrong?
4227,Oh.. thats horrible.  I am so sorry.
4228,"Myself as well, friends are what make life better."
4229,Alone time is important but you will go crazy if you are always alone.
4230,Was it a smartphone? Maybe you can track it ?
4231,"Aw, that sucks. Did you get a new phone?"
4232,He is a terrible person! Did he even know it was your cat? What took so long...
4233,I hope you feel better
4234,What kind of cars do you like the best?
4235,Range Rovers are my favorite too. If you work hard you can get one!
4236,When did she pass away?
4237,Well have you been living a happy life? She would probably be happy about that.
4238,I am sure she is happy too
4239,"It can be hard, but its possible"
4240,Do you have cameras?
4241,I know right? It's even more worse when it's hot outside and it cooks to your car so it's harder to clean up
4242,"Have you seen any recently? It is really sad, what gets me the most is hearing about black bears being hit."
4243,"Poor thing, it's not fair! Drivers need to watch out!"
4244,Well hopefully the car didn't get damaged.
4245,Well i would just be happy nothing too bad happened at least.
4246,That's frightening. Was it dark outsside?
4247,That's even worse. I hate being lost in general
4248,Oh man that stinks. What did you do in response?
4249,Did he ever apologize?
4250,I've never had a party like that myself.
4251,No one really likes me enough to do that for me.
4252,What journey?  Do tell.
4253,Oh Congratulations...  That is a huge accomplishment!
4254,"oof, that is a long healing process after the surgery."
4255,That is tough i bet. I hope he heals well.
4256,That's awesome! Did you guys do anything?
4257,Nice! I hope you guys did a lot of catching up!
4258,Wow! What a jerk for him to up and leave with no way to contact him. Was it a lot of money?
4259,"I'm so sorry, you should see if you can find him on social media!"
4260,Who was following you?!
4261,What did he look like? I would call the cops if they are stalking you.
4262,Oh man! Does it still work??
4263,I would have sat there playing for hours.
4264,Oh snap! dude get your camera you might have found nessy.
4265,Probably could be a new species of gator.
4266,I know how that goes.  It can be hard to stay on track at the end of the semester.
4267,Congratulations!  Studying really pays off!
4268,"Jeeze, I thought that only happened to me. Doesn't it just suck? I don't blame you for not picking it up, I can imagine how gross it must've been"
4269,"It's okay, most people would do that and not even care, so the fact that you even have the trashman in your mind shows that you're a good person."
4270,"Yeah, been there done that. You want to comfort them but you don't know what to do/say"
4271,I hope he feels better and you could be there for him too!
4272,Oh poor lady. I know how it is though. Sometimes our initial reaction is to laugh even when not appropriate.
4273,At least you recognize that it may not have been appropriate. 
4274,I can imagine. Was she a hoarder of some type?
4275,Did you see anything interesting?
4276,Did you tip him well for doing such a good job?
4277,It is not often that you get good service at a restaurant.
4278,I enjoy doing that after a hard day at work as well.  I hope it relaxes you!
4279,Now I am in the mood for Netflix!  Enjoy the new series now that you are relaxed!
4280,Did you punch him in the nose?
4281,This is why i got rid of all of my friends.
4282,Ah - that's a big accomplishment!!!  Did you get her a great present?
4283,HAHA!  That is the best tradition I've ever heard of!
4284,"Oh man, I know the nerves can be rough, but I'm sure you're excited as well. But yea, throwing yourself into a group of new people can be rough."
4285,"Oh wow. Well, I really hope you enjoy the new job! I have a feeling you'll do just fine."
4286,Yes.. I have a test coming up and I should be studying right now!  LOL
4287,They say some of the smartest people are procrastinators.
4288,Did you find anything interesting inside any of the buildings?
4289,"Oh man, I would have freaked out! What did you do?"
4290,That is pretty great! what show is it?
4291,Haven't heard of it but since your son's going to be on it i will watch it.
4292,"As someone who was once a 19 year old man, don't be too shocked."
4293,Yikes he's one of the zombie drunks.   That's unfortunate.  Drinking might not be for him.
4294,Most do. I know a guy that kind of gets blackout drunk like that.  His brother does too.  Now neither of them drink hard liquor (well they haven't for ages now)
4295,That's really cool. I know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him.
4296,That's really interesting. I know my husband is bad about leaving his laying around and forgetting where they are. When he finds them again it is such a surprise.
4297,What was it?
4298,So everything is okay then? That's good news!
4299,Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about getting another one?
4300,"Oh I understand. They say time heals all wounds, I hope it does in your case as well."
4301,Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I have been to court before; it isn't as scary as it seems.
4302,"That won't happen. Even if it does, the judge may have a good laugh and cut you some slack."
4303,I am guessing she is not with us anymore?
4304,I know the feeling i had my grandmother gone for 5 years now still miss her.
4305,Did he tell you the reason?
4306,If you live under his roof then you should obey him.
4307,"I understand, I have trouble waking up early too."
4308,"Me too, I just have to set a bunch of alarms and try my best."
4309,Were you worried it could be something very serious?
4310,That's good to hear. I'm sure you feel very relieved now.
4311,What was that?
4312,A bunch of toys and stuff?
4313,That is pretty good news! What kind of job is it for?
4314,Everyone needs a IT guy though so probably.
4315,I see people walk out of the bathroom all the time without washing their hands. So gross.
4316,That is really disgusting. I don't think I would ever eat at his house. 
4317,"Yeah, no doubt!"
4318,"I'm sure you aren't the worst in the class, don't say that!"
4319,"There's always next time, you just need to study harder!"
4320,That is awful. I hope she has friends and family she can lean on during this tough time.
4321,I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.  I feel so bad for her.
4322,"That's unlucky, did you ever exchange information?"
4323,Well I hope it all works out in the end somehow.
4324,What kind of dog was the costume or did it look weird?
4325,Well were they trying to sell something maybe?
4326,That is so cool.  What kinda stuff does she juggle?
4327,hahaha funny.
4328,"Oh, lord. Did the other person die?"
4329,"Man, i would have left and walked out right away."
4330,That has to make you feel so good deep inside.
4331,"Wow, that is thoughtful.  Thoughtfulness will help him go a long way in life."
4332,Wow! How can someone do that to someone with someone so close?
4333,"That's such a shame. And shame on his brother, too!"
4334,What did you watch/?
4335,So what was it?  You are making me scared.
4336,Oh man that is pretty scary.
4337,You should probably see a priest then.
4338,I hate when that happens.  Makes you want to leave things for the mailman.
4339,I hope they can take it back for you.
4340,Are you baby crazy?  Let me guess.. 30-ish?
4341,That sucks. Missed opportunity or biological problems?
4342,"Whatever it is, you seem excited. What is it?"
4343,Vacations are sooooo nice!!!  I hope you have an amazing one@!
4344,That's really annoying for you but I hope everyone involved is okay.
4345,I cannot stand people who do that! Don't they know they could be blocking someone from getting the medical attention they need?
4346,Why are you there all alone?
4347,I hope you aren't too lonely!
4348,Oh no. Why did he steal?
4349,"Sometimes they have a reason, and it doesn't make him a bad person depending on the reason."
4350,That was so nice of her. I'm sure that you really appreciated her for doing that.
4351,Maybe you have a budding chef on your hands.
4352,"A bit of nostalgia, huh?  It is always wonderful to look back on old family memories."
4353,The times we share with family should always be cherished.
4354,"Oh no, what happened if you don't mind me asking."
4355,"Oh man, that sucks. You can enjoy the day on your own! Forget them then."
4356,"Oh, I love surprises like that! How exciting!"
4357,I hope not either but it's sweet!
4358,You must be thrilled. What did you have?
4359,Is this your first?
4360,"Oh no, I know that must make you feel bad, but you can't always be there."
4361,That's good. How many girls do you have?
4362,That sucks.  Maybe they can wait just a bit longer for you?
4363,We always need to make time for our families.  They are the most important thing in this world.
4364,Wow. Must be a really good show. What's it about?
4365,I love thrillers. I watched Killing Eve.
4366,Are you working while you are at work?
4367,Smart man smart man.
4368,"Oh no, what happened to cause the cheating?"
4369,Have you guys talked about it? Or is he still upset?
4370,How many do you have? Are they excited?
4371,What is making you so nervous?
4372,had they been eating too many?
4373,"oh, that's a cute one."
4374,What will you do if you can't be with your wife all the time?
4375,Oh that makes a lot of sense now then.
4376,Ohhh no!  There was no one there to offer you a towel?
4377,Was it crowded?
4378,Make him Facebook famous. The Viral terrible mail man. 
4379,Send you self a empty package or something.
4380,"Wow. Raccoon digging through the trash, hu?"
4381,Are you usually afraid of raccoons or just surprised?
4382,Was this an unplanned trip?
4383,"Well, I'm sorry that this was sprung upon you, but I hope you have a safe trip!"
4384,Wow. That's a pretty low thing to do.
4385,Oh just a nail? You are a nice person.
4386,Wow! What a champ for doing that. You guys owe him!
4387,Get that man a wife!
4388,You must be so relieved that its done. 
4389,They are going to have so much fun with it.
4390,That's a really adult move on her part.
4391,She's showing she's responsible. I think she'll be just fine growing up.
4392,I wish you the best of luck on your proposal and the possibility of it becoming a reality.
4393,What kind of project may I ask?
4394,I hope you did well and congratulations on Law School!
4395,"Law is a pretty tough career. You must've worked hard, and I'm sure that will pay off."
4396,Sometimes it is very hard and the jealousy can come out. I hope you have a really strong relationship though.
4397,I have seen many relationships be destroyed because of time and space. Good luck to you all.
4398,That's so great to hear. Relationships can be hit or miss sometimes. Sounds like you got a good one.
4399,Over 2 decades. That's a long time.
4400,That sounds cool.  So you are fixing it yourself?
4401,Best of luck with that.  Hopefully you will do fine and save a ton of cash.
4402,"Oh no, do you at least have food?"
4403,Ramen is delicious! I eat them even when I'm not worrying about money.
4404,Whoa awesome! Really you've never been? Which one are you going too?
4405,Whoa! Make sure to bring money for food or bring frozen drinks. And lots of sunscreen and comfy shoes!
4406,I'm glad you can do what you're passionate about.  What kinds of animals do you rescue?
4407,"That sounds so fun.  I hope I can do that some day, too!"
4408,I can imagine. Take this time to do something for yourself.
4409,There you go. Sounds like fun.
4410,Caught by a train? Do you mean it was late?
4411,hahah I was kind of concerned but didn't want to ask. Glad that is the case then.
4412,How do you cheat a little. Either you cheat or you don't.
4413,what show was it ?
4414,i loved the ed gein documentary 
4415,Oh no thats terrible.  Did you make it up to him?
4416,That is thoughtful!
4417,congratulations. You worked really hard and deserved that pass!
4418,That's an amazing feat. Studying is kind of a chore for me.
4419,Awww.. what kinda dog is it?
4420,that is so cute.  I had one of those.
4421,"Oh, were you just tired that day?"
4422,lol it happens. Had a good night?
4423,Congratulations on the kid
4424,I am sure she will be fin
4425,I get that so many people in the world are so much worse off then us. I think it's easy to forget that.
4426,I wish I could be more like you. 
4427,Oh no! I really hope it goes well for you! That must be so stressful!
4428,I'm sorry. That is a really tough situation. I'll be thinking of you and hoping for the best.
4429,I'm sure you'll be able to do yours soon.  And maybe you can get some good ideas from hers!
4430,And when you do yours it will be that much newer than hers ;)
4431,"I bet you are very eager to find out, good luck!"
4432,Was the test hard?
4433,Double check your list.  Camping is always wonderful but hard to come back for something you forgot.
4434,Did you make a list?
4435,"Me either. I don't want too though,lol. Are you scared?"
4436,Oh man. Well I used to cuddle a dog when I would get scared. Find a dog
4437,Oh nice. What color is it?
4438,"Interesting to see how muave works. That's a shade of purple, isn't it?"
4439,Oh no. I hope they're okay. How long until your neighbor gets home?
4440,I hope everything turns out okay.
4441,"Man, that's horrible luck. Did you forget to lock it, or did they just bust in?"
4442,"Are you kidding me? The nerve of some people. How desperate do you have to be... Well, I hope you can at least replace the present so your son isn't too sad. And at least they didn't try to bust into your home and harm you."
4443,"That's pretty lucky, did you spend it?"
4444,Well if you do choose to spend it make sure you do it wisely!
4445,"Lol! The real question is...was the poop fresh or old? I hate that shit, no pun intended"
4446,"Ewww, did you clean it off?"
4447,I wish I had a expedition
4448,I agree with you there. Let's just finish this one.
4449,I hope they do for you as well. Thank you!
4450,That's funny. I'd tell them the tooth fairy stole it. 
4451,You better come up with something.
4452,Oh man! Will you need a new keyboard now?
4453,"Oh don't worry, accidents happen!"
4454,Yes!!! I hate the city and prefer the rural areas. Are you going to get farm animals?
4455,"I agree, I love farms because it feels so natural."
4456,At this point all you can do is hope for the best. Hopefully if you worked hard it will turn out good.
4457,Don't stress over it. You can't change anything at this point.
4458,"That's always rough, maybe she didn't hear you?"
4459,Well she was just rude then. Not your fault at all.
4460,OMG that is wonderful!!!  I bet you are really proud!
4461,You say that but it sure is nice!
4462,Oh wow. Is it raining or something over there?
4463,How long is the work gonna take? I hope you don't get any weird power outages.
4464,That sucks. What did you order?
4465,"Yea, Mcdonald's can be so hit or miss sometimes."
4466,Thats sucks
4467,Well. Maybe youll get a promotion.
4468,It would.
4469,Nice! Where did you learn Thai?
4470,That's impressive. I bet you are more than prepared for this trip then!
4471,"You're moving into the dorms soon, hu? Are you excited?"
4472,What's your major?
4473,That is cool! Was it a gift for any certain occasion? 
4474,I bet you were so happy! That's so awesome!
4475,I am sure it will be worth it in the end
4476,I bet he was proud too
4477,Animal abuse disgusts me. I don't what would drive someone to do that...
4478,"If I had a chance to rescue an animal, I would totally do it. "
4479,Did you get sunscreen and a waterproof belly bag and a hat?
4480,Oh no! Yes it's the number one thing to not forget. I hope you all have fun!
4481,"Wow, how exciting. I bet it looks like a fat little old man."
4482,I would hit it out of spit now
4483,Must have thought you wanted some of his sweet unemployment check
4484,"That's what I'm talking about! That sounds so nice. I'm a little jealous. Sounds like you deserve it, though."
4485,That's always nice to hear. Better that then hearing someone else getting the spotlight and recognition just because they're in a higher position. I hope that keeps happening for you.
4486,He sounds so computer-savy.  How will you repay him?
4487,Dinner might be a welcomed surprise.
4488,Me too!! I love summer weather and vibes so much
4489,"I know, the free time is the best. You can do whatever you want, whenever!"
4490,OH no. Shame of you!
4491,Just don't do again and I'll keep your secret.
4492,Nice! What is his major?
4493,I am sure you will get it
4494,I do believe you
4495,"Whoa whoa whoa, that still happens in this day and age? How did they even get away with that?"
4496,"Well, good. I hope they got a lot of negative press. That stuff shouldn't fly these days. "
4497,That is way too much money to blow for sure
4498,I feel bad for the parents then
4499,That is horrible! Were their any cameras?
4500,Oh man. That's too bad. Still not fair.
4501,Sounds like so much fun.  What did you see?
4502,It must have been really scary movie then.  Try leaving the tv on to help.
4503,That sad. I hope she is okay.
4504,It will be fine. Make sure you spend time with her and let her know that it will be okay. It can be helpful/
4505,That sounds delicious! What type of pizza did you order?
4506,Lol! Maybe the rat is the chef? The restaurant's secret is a rat in the hat!
4507,"Aww, that's sad. Do you have a bad relationship or not have one?"
4508,That can get really lonely but it's good to find yourself so you are really ready when the right one comes along.
4509,"I feel you, my brother is my roommate and my friend too :)"
4510,"That sucks, why did she move out?"
4511,I know exactly what you mean. I've been single 2 years now.
4512,I think I'm a little rusty in that department myself.
4513,Why aren't you looking forward to it?
4514,That's unfortunate. A week is a long time.
4515,"That sounds like a lot of fun! I mean I haven't even really gone anywhere higher than Olive Garden myself, so I'm jealous. Did you go with anyone special?"
4516,"That's really sweet! I bet that was a nice scene. Was it a special occasion, or did you guys just want to enjoy yourselves just for the heck of it"
4517,Thant sucks. I always use turbo tax. 
4518,Maybethey will let you do a payment plan?
4519,Well I bet you'll do better next time. I hate paying extra for anything.
4520,Oh wow! That's awesome! What will you buy?
4521,That's a good idea. It's extra money so do what you want!
4522,That's awesome! How long has it been since you've seen him?
4523,"Oh, that sucks then. I hope you guys get along and squash beef?"
4524,"I am sorry, that sounds gross"
4525,I hate that smell
4526,Nice! Thinking about it...I'm 22 and still don't know how to change a tire hahah
4527,"I should learn how to do it, it seems pretty basic?"
4528,"Nice, tell him congrats. What did he major in?"
4529,He should become an English teacher1
4530,How much did you lose
4531,I am sure you will make it
4532,Why would he do that??
4533,What is her name?
4534,That;s cute. I love the cute names people give their pets.
4535,Don't feel guilty. We all slip sometimes.
4536,Ha Ha. Just try to do better next time.
4537,What was the menu?
4538,I bet she loved it!
4539,What's wrong?
4540,I hope so too. I'm sorry that he is going through that.
4541,A lot of kids these days are addicted to technology. Does she listen to you often?
4542,That sucks. How old is she because if she is young she may grow out of it
4543,That's great. Sometimes family isn't good with loans.
4544,Was it pretty far down before?
4545,"Wow, they are still making them? Only ones I enjoyed was MW1, MW2, and BO1."
4546,I actually did buy that one on Steam but it barely has any players :(
4547,What is your favorite dish?
4548,"I've heard of that dish before. I need to try it sometime, can I come?!"
4549,I bet you find someone soon
4550,"I have been there too, it will get better"
4551,"Sounds like she's going to be on ""Master Chef"" in a couple of years. What did she make?"
4552,That's wise - it's irresponsible to let kids meander in the kitchen alone. Too many sharp objects.
4553,Thats sounds promising.
4554,"Sometimes people think they don't need to study, but it really is helpful even if you think you know the material"
4555,"Aww, that's sweet of her! You're lucky to have her, not all moms are good."
4556,"That's good, I'm sure she enjoys seeing you happy and taken care of."
4557,"That's pretty sweet of her. Some people would find it annoying that their parents still want to baby them, but I say you shouldn't take it for granted. They just want to be in your life."
4558,"Well, let her know here and there how much you appreciate it. Sometimes we forget that even though we think and feel certain things, it's not always obvious to the other person. They need some verbal confirmation of appreciation!"
4559,Eating vegetables is disgusting to me so I just blend it all in a smoothie. You should try that
4560,"Honestly, I have no idea. But it beats eating vegetables 1 by 1 because that takes forever"
4561,I hate that feeling. Hopefully you will feel better about it tomorrow.
4562,You can always start again tomorrow.
4563,"Well at least after the storm, there will be some sunshine!"
4564,That's where earmuffs or plugs come in handy my friend
4565,"That is horrible luck!  At least you weren't hurt.  Some insurance companies cover that as well, so you should check."
4566,Hopefully that little mishap doesn't cot you anuthing!
4567,"Oooo, that sounds fun. Will you visit that giant place where gladiators fought?"
4568,"Well, now I know where I want to visit too. Great idea!"
4569,"Hey, I just saw that trailer! I'm kind of excited for it too since I loved him as a kid. But I felt like the trailer had a few dumb lines it, even though I love Tom Hardy."
4570,"You're right, he was pretty good as Bane. Glad to see someone else is a fan and is looking forward to it.I see it getting a lot of negativity."
4571,"I agree, I love that feeling. What do you do for work?"
4572,"Nice, I bet it sucks when it's blazing hot outside."
4573,Who did you invite?
4574,Where was the party?
4575,October? I thought most Call of Duty games come out in November?
4576,"It will be October as soon as you know it, trust me. Hopefully they release a beta so we can play it earlier."
4577,"I have not seen it yet, tell me abnout it"
4578,That sounds insane honestly.
4579,Wow.Really? What kind?
4580,What's your uncle's number? lol
4581,Cool. Say hi to your new Auntie! 
4582,"Happens a lot to me actually, it's sometimes enough to make me sad."
4583,"Yeah, I get like that. I sometimes drive somewhere just to get the feeling I used to have there. Crazy how life goes."
4584,I'm sorry you were dissappointed.  It is hard to spend so much money on a dud movie.  Was the popcorn good at least?
4585,"It's always good to save money, but still, it stinks.  They should have to make them good for the prices they charge."
4586,"Wow, she is a keeper. What car is it?"
4587,Congratulations on the strong marriage and car!
4588,I know you will be great in the end.
4589,"People do that sometimes, and it is really sad."
4590,Why? What happens on Christmas eve for you?
4591,"Ohhh, duh! I should have seen that coming lol"
4592,That's too bad. Are you thinking about going to court for it?
4593,"Yeah, that's a load of whack. I hope you win your case and show those pigs who's boss."
4594,Well that's disappointing. Have you been working there longer then your co-worker?
4595,I believe in you!!
4596,"My friends and family always talk about that show, is it good? "
4597,I heard it's really graphic and a lot of sex scenes. I will watch it...for educational purposes.
4598,Ive been there
4599,Just imagine if you found a mix tape on an actual cassette
4600,Are you sure it wasn't palying dead?
4601,"Eww, what the heck! I guess you really were at a bad place at the time."
4602,I'm sure you will knock it out of the park. What is it on?
4603,That's neat - I like economics as well. Why are you so gung-ho about it?
4604,"Oh, then don't feel bad? I think the teacher is trying to get everyone else involved."
4605,You can always give them some money once you get yourself back on your feet. Just keep your head up - things will get better.
4606,"If I ever meet you, I will toss a few bucks your way. We all have to help each other out in this tough world."
4607,Cool! What did you get?
4608,Well good for you!
4609,Investigate that right now! You need to know
4610,"I would not do that, just get a divorce and take half of all."
4611,wow. I hope you have studied hard so you will do well. 
4612,Well as long as you have studied hard you should do well. Just relax knowing you have prepared yourself. 
4613,Oh my goodness! Did you get hurt?
4614,That's so sad. Did your house get damaged?
4615,"Yeah, that bothers me to.  Don't sweat it too much though.  Just consider it their loss and move on."
4616,There are.  The people who ignore you are not worth your time or effort.
4617,"You got this bro, just be confident. I believe in you"
4618,She likes you! If she asks/talks about you then you have a much better chance too.
4619,That is so great! Are you in the process of applying now? I'm sure you will get in eventually.
4620,Perhaps. Or you just need to keep trying. Don't give up on your dreams so easily!
4621,"That sounds interesting, is it hard to make?"
4622,Did you really just say that hahaha. You are crazy
4623,That sounds like fun. But I don't think Hillbilly is a very nice way to describe people. 
4624,"Funny, but true. Have you ever been to the races before?"
4625,Exciting! Did you get any neat gifts?
4626,It's always good to have friends that know your likes. What is in your collection?
4627,That's always fun. Did you win any money?
4628,Oh darn. Better luck next time.
4629,"That is terrible, are you okay?"
4630,"I feel super bad about that, i wish the best for you."
4631,"I believe in you, man. I'm a bit rotund myself, but I started hitting the gym this past week."
4632,"Yeah! By the end of the year, we'll be lifting Ford F 150's!"
4633,For what? Are you a diver or something?
4634,"Oh, well good luck. Have you heard of Wim Hof? He's like a world record breath holder and he does it in freezing temperatures too. "
4635,My dog does that too. I think it's the loud noises that scare them. 
4636,"Lol, if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying. That would be hilarious."
4637,"Haha. These dogs that I'm dog-sitting wouldn't let that happen. They wake me up at 6:30AM every morning to feed them. But hey, we make mistakes. Maybe you had a busy day today."
4638,"Ah, hate's a strong word. They're smarter than we give them credit for. They know you always feed them. At the end of the day, I doubt she could have a much better owner"
4639,What is a aardvark?
4640,"I thought so. The name alone sounds so exotic, were you mad that you had to clean pooop?"
4641,"You usually don't get that much jail time for drunk driving if it is your first incident. It shouldn't be so bad, but hopefully it will make you more cautious in the future."
4642,Oh wow. I really hope that you get the help you need. I can relate though...I used to be reckless like that a couple years back. Just have to be responsible and arrange an uber or some other form of transportation.
4643,"Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. Did you get her something nice?"
4644,"That was very thoughtful, something to keep her entertained when she wasn't feeling well. Is she doing better?"
4645,That's gross.
4646,Thanks for that information.
4647,That's so nice! Did she like your craftsmanship?
4648,It was still a nice gesture. I would love my children to build be a big ole gazebo.
4649,Nice! Did you manage to snag the promotion?
4650,It's good to work hard for that dough. What's your new billet entail?
4651,Oh my goodness! I bet that was embarrassing. But it happens. 
4652,eventually they will forget. They will probably do something even more embarrassing then the joke will be on them. haha.
4653,That is nice. What kind of computer did he get?
4654,I wish I had a better computer. Why do they have to cost so much?
4655,How did that experience go?
4656,"I'm very glad, and I understand how the memories are."
4657,I would too.  What had happened?
4658,Yes.  Did they admit fault?
4659,How old are your kids?
4660,Are you worried they are going to be abducted or something?
4661,What can you lose?
4662,"You do. I mean it can only go one of two ways. And if it goes one way, you can try again with another girl."
4663,Do they have insomnia?
4664,Well they will have insomnia and sore bottoms haha
4665,"That happened to me too when I was in elementary school. I lost all my friends and had to make new ones, which sucks."
4666,I agree.
4667,I bet she felt really special!
4668,I can relate to that!
4669,Me too. I miss payments sometimes because I forget about them and I'm lazy.
4670,That's my exact situation too.
4671,"Ah, so you're in the same boat as me? I can understand how that goes. Electricity is so necessary nowadays, too."
4672,"I'm with you. Sometimes responsibilities get too overwhelming and you feel like you have to hide from them. At some point though, I'm sure you and I will improve."
4673,Smoking is pretty bad for everyone.
4674,"You have to try, it could change your life."
4675,I like dogs
4676,How many do you have?
4677,Can you get another job?
4678,Can you take out a loan?
4679,"Yankees fan, huh? I should pit you against my brother. He loves the Red Sox. I bet you guys would argue for a while."
4680,"Haha, he'd probably say the same thing to you. He's been a fan of them for about 20 years. What about you? How long have you followed them?"
4681,"That sucks, how old were they?"
4682,"Wow, how old are the kids?"
4683,IT;s sad but I think so too.
4684,Congratulations. We don't share the same sentiment.
4685,Have you asked him how he feels about that entire situation?
4686,"Life is a scary place, anything could happen at any time."
4687,"Really? That's one of the saddest things I've heard in a while. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened to your family, if you don't mind me asking?"
4688,I am terribly sorry to hear that. You've got to be really resilient to deal with that. Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen during Thanksgiving so you could have a chance to be around others?
4689,Did you do anything after she did it?
4690,"I have never had siblings, so not sure what to tell ya."
4691,"Why's that? Did you specifically have a bad experience with them, or just assume they're terrible no matter what?"
4692,Trapped in a cave? I couldn't handle that. I'm claustrophobic. I'd freak out in a second. How long were you trapped for?
4693,Some people are just cruel.
4694,You should have called the police. If they were just vandals they probably did it to someone else to.
4695,"That's annoying. Kids these days are really attached to electronics, just how it goes. I know it's hard to cut them off, but have you tried managing his electronics time more closely?"
4696,"I would be, too. At that age, they don't understand why they can't have it. It's like talking to a brick wall. I hope it gets easier for you as he gets older."
4697,Did you practice first in a parking lot?
4698,Did you use GPS?
4699,I can understand that.  I feel like Trump should have gone to jail a long time ago
4700,I totally agree with you
4701,I think they are just empty threats but you never know.
4702,You and me both. 
4703,Why don't you move back?
4704,Can you make new friends where you are now?
4705,Oh no! How many days left until she starts school?
4706,"Wow, that's some really slow shipping times. Maybe you will get lucky and they will come in the mail sooner."
4707,I am totally with you
4708,I am sure you could
4709,"Wow, you can teach an old dog new tricks."
4710,Indeed. It would be fun to see your friends again and be around them
4711,I think being with children is a joy that not everybody can understand
4712,How much is the phone?
4713,Will you be able to pay that off quick thou?
4714,Oh no. Did it ever come back?
4715,That sucks. MY sisters dog used to roam the neighborhood a lot and one day he didn't come back either. His name was Oreo. I told my daughter he got married.
4716,Where did you go?
4717,I love New Orleans.
4718,Awwww  i can relate to that.  I am so sorry.
4719,I am very sorry to hear that
4720,Who was it?
4721,That was nice of them.
4722,"I'm not too fond of winter, but what kind of coat did you buy?"
4723,"Awesome, I bet it's comfy! How cold does it get where you live?"
4724,When does he start?
4725,I am sure he will have fun.
4726,You may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need
4727,"Neighbors, co-workers.  Try and get involved in local sports or comunity groups.  How about volunteering.  That is a good way to meet people that are positive"
4728,Where did they come from?
4729,Where did they go?
4730,"I'm not particularly a fan of subways either, but why are you so scared of being robbed?"
4731,I think the overall chances of that are pretty low. Though I do understand your fear.
4732,So I take it you get along well with your boss?
4733,"That's great to hear, often times we here of people who hate their bosses!"
4734,That really is disappointing.  Can you fix it?
4735,I am so sorry to hear that
4736,Did you hurt yourself?
4737,"I am sure they have fallen before, no big deal."
4738,I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think that is? Is it a painful or happy memory?
4739,I can understand that. That does sound like a difficult thing to deal with. Hopefully you have a lot of nice memories you can look back on to remember her by.
4740,It is these delicate balance of our natural body that makes us to be diligent for survival
4741,Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features
4742,"I bet that was a nice surprise! That's pretty cool. What was it for, if you don't mind me asking?"
4743,"That's really cool... And also way above my head! But seriously, that sounds like smart, hard work. You should be proud. I'm glad you got that ""moment in the sun."""
4744,"Wow, that's amazing! Shows that we can't judge a book by it's cover. We automatically think it would take a large man to do something like that!"
4745,I would have been unable to move for the rest of the day!
4746,"Dang, that's rough. Like a double-dose of sadness. My girlfriend and I are long distance, so I know how that goes. Is there any way you can still keep in touch with them?"
4747,"Yeah, she and I don't use social media, but I can imagine that'd be really helpful in your case. Well, I'm glad you at least have that. And maybe it will open up the possibility for you to meet new people, too."
4748,"Well, we don't like unnecessary attention, and we don't like talking about ourselves. We just like skyping between each other, and that's it. And talking on the phone, of course."
4749,Was it for school?
4750,Did you get fired due to it?
4751,That is a little daunting.  Have you considered joining some groups with like-minded individuals?
4752,Check with your community center
4753,Aww! How sweet! I can imagine the first few days are crazy.
4754,I do not have any kids. Honestly too scared for child birth haha
4755,"Aw, that is fantastic! How did yall meet?"
4756,"Wow, you guys meet pretty early on. That's nice that you pretty much grew together as you became adults."
4757,Hopefully a happy birthday is going to be in order soon!
4758,Happy early birthday then.  Drink up!
4759,Oh really! Any ideas why?
4760,Maybe they like you?
4761,"Yes, they can be fun I guess."
4762,Yes that could be very annoying.
4763,That is so sad. Did the kitten die? I hope not.
4764,"Oh, I hope it was ok. I understand you not being able to stop."
4765,"No joke? That's terrible. Why was the security camera off? And seriously, who steals a lawn mower? What bums."
4766,"Oh, that makes sense. I had no idea, since I've never used them. That sounds really inconvenient. Maybe they were waiting for the perfect moment to strike... What chumps."
4767,"Oh wow, what luck! I bet you slowed down after that!"
4768,Well that's good that you use this as a reason to stop speeding. Some people never learn!
4769,I love Colorado.
4770,Did you have fun?
4771,It is. Now we have to deal with rains and snows. So much to go for the next summer
4772,I think climate change will only exacerbate the freezing temperatures during winter season
4773,Why did you decide not to go?
4774,Did you make it to the game at least?
4775,What is the big end goal?
4776,I think you can do it.
4777,That's not good. What's wrong?
4778,"Oh man, that would make me angry! Is there anyone you can call and report them anonymously?"
4779,Maybe you can sneak over and steal them?
4780,oh no that would make me feel guilty!!! Is he okay?
4781,is he allergic to that type of food? If not you need to transition him slowly! But that's funny lol
4782,Who did you leave him with?
4783,Did he destroy the house?
4784,That sounds great.  What do you get to visit for?
4785,That sounds like a great experience!
4786,I was too! What do you think caused it?!
4787,I agree with you. Having a good coach is crucial for team success.
4788,What state is that?
4789,That does surprise me actually.
4790,I'm sorry to hear that. It always sucks missing the good old days.
4791,I can kind of see where you're coming from. I personally try to avoid too much nostalgia. Others seem to love it.
4792,That is incredible. What a determination and dedication he must have put for achieving such a result
4793,I wish I had that level of willpower to even lose a couple of pounds from my hanging waist fat
4794,"Wow, I have never been! What all did you see?"
4795,Oh cool. What was you favorite thing at the square? 
4796,A part in what?
4797,What play is it?
4798,That is rough news.  How long?
4799,That is hard.  I am so sorry
4800,What kind of puppies?
4801,Why don't you buy one from your friend?
4802,oddly enough so am I. I just want to be comfortable. How do you feel about that?
4803,"That's very good, do you feel content at the moment?"
4804,Did you spill something on it?
4805,Are you excited about it?
4806,I hope you have a great time!
4807,Maybe you should take a different class.
4808,You will have to study harder then.
4809,Especially getting gifts from family. What a special holiday this is
4810,"How weird it may seem, but my mom still gives me children's book as a gift for each Christmas"
4811,Awww that is sad but happy al at the same time!
4812,I hear that.  You hang in there
4813,does that usually happen often? 
4814,haha yeah it happens to me too. I bet you're frustrated about that. Have you tried different apps?
4815,I know what you mean. It is always a reason to be proud.
4816,I just set short term goals along the way.
4817,What does he do for work?
4818,Well you could always pick up a new hobby! What is something you've always wanted to learn?
4819,Me too
4820,"Oh, man. Why is that?"
4821,That is wonderful to hear
4822,Don't ever forget why!
4823,What time is it at?
4824,Make sure you get there early.
4825,Have you spoke to her?
4826,"Oh yeah me too man, you like the fall?"
4827,Yeah me too it's very comfortable. What else do you think about it?
4828,Why do you think that is?
4829,"I love my dog, i still cheat on it."
4830,How much did you win?
4831,Do you have any of it left?
4832,"Yes, I prefer the fall also."
4833,That football starts.
4834,I'm sorry about your loss. How are you doing?
4835,What exactly happened?
4836,That's great! What makes you so confident?
4837,Well that awesome to hear! I hope you do get it soon!
4838,Gold club where?
4839,How many holes does it have?
4840,Oh no!  What does he do that is so annoying?
4841,It is nice that he wants to stay connected I guess
4842,Who are you going with?
4843,"Nice, have they been before?"
4844,you were? Was your pregnancy planned
4845,hahah oh man finally that is so good! Congratulations on your children
4846,Oh no! Have you bought a test yet? Were you trying?
4847,Thats scary! I hope that you aren't pregnant then!!
4848,I hope so
4849,What is the disagreement about?
4850,I agree. What do you think will help people get along?
4851,Yes when I was little.
4852,"I also had a dog, did you find your dog?"
4853,"That is terrible, i would cry as well."
4854,"you can always adopt, thats what we did!"
4855,What kind?
4856,"Nice, was model is it?"
4857,"Oh, wow! That's awesome that your friend unexpectedly surprised you. "
4858,I bet that was really heartwarming. I'm glad you had that experience. 
4859,Tell me about it. I got like 3 hours last night
4860,Hey! Girlfriends just need an ear some time. 
4861,you can do whatever you want!! You like beer?
4862,oh okay I see lol chugging reminds me of high school
4863,What do you do with her?
4864,Is she still alive?
4865,Yes you will with that attitude
4866,That is the key isnt it?
4867,Congratulations! You and your family must be delighted to have a new member!
4868,I am sure that you will be a great parent. You clearly show that you already love your new born daughter.
4869,"I would cry, very much!"
4870,I would cry and cry for days.
4871,Worms? yuck!
4872,But you just said you do like them.
4873,What are you going to buy?
4874,What store will you go to?
4875,I had to use a subway once to get to work on time.
4876,"It was ok, but while on the train I lost my phone and somebody returned it to me."
4877,Do you enjoy your free time or are you sad?
4878,"Cool, I have a pair of jeans."
4879,When will you wear them?
4880,Did you get sleepy while studying?
4881,i would have fallen asleep for sure.
4882,I live and take care of my grandmother too!
4883,"Yea, I feel that it is worth every second of it! They are the reasons we exist"
4884,That is understandable.  You need to let it happen naturally. Be with your friends and find yourself
4885,I understand.  It will happen for you if you keep an open mind and don't rush
4886,did you not want to leave them with someone else?
4887,it is did you have fun?
4888,Vegas is always a popular destination for vacation!
4889,Clubs are so fun! Any specific ones in mind?
4890,That's terrible! How did you punish your dog?
4891,Maybe your dog has learned it's lesson.
4892,What happened on it?
4893,"Wow, sounds like you have good fiends, and it was fun."
4894,That's good. Some people don't appreciate anything.
4895,That's a blessing too. I happy that my family is healthy too.
4896,Oh no!  What happened?
4897,That is really ridiculous that they shut it off over just $1 though!
4898,"Aww, that's a nice story. I'm glad you have that to carry with you."
4899,I'm thinking of a time that a party was thrown for me as a surprise. All those people getting together was really fun.
4900,These nostalgic emotions are unique and very pleasant to have. I sometimes rewind them in my mind just to escape from my anxiety
4901,Old memories that are good tend to help me emotionally and mentally. Not those that were distressing
4902,Did you ask why your partner refused. That is very weird.
4903,"That is okay, at least she was honest with you about her preferences."
4904,I would guess that if your survival mode you will do whatever you have to.
4905,"I would like to think that I wouldn't but if it were that or die, I'd eat."
4906,What happened? Did you?
4907,"That's perfect then, i'm sure you did a great job@"
4908,Tell me exactly what that was like? Hopefully it's different now?
4909,I could not even imagine how mad your parents must be.
4910,Nice! I bet it is a very cute puppy.
4911,That is just adorable! You should take many photos before it grows too big!
4912,yes i am mortified jeans ripped
4913, i am working
4914,Woah! That is great news. Have you told anyone yet?
4915,I don't blame you at all. You just received life changing news.
4916,You are so right. It can make all the difference.
4917,It is challenging to raise children. Everybody could use a hand.
4918,I feel the same way. There are so many people who are struggling now.
4919,It's such a difficult situation that you just don't know where to begin.
4920,Great@  So you found out already that you got it or are you just confident?
4921,that is upsetting.  I am sorry to hear that
4922,ok you going to your family
4923,no
4924,That can be upsetting. Did they tell you why?
4925,Maybe it's time to look for another job.
4926,That is impressive.  Why did you doubt them?
4927,Is it something you are happy with?
4928,I hate interviews the most.
4929,"Sure you can, work for yourself!"
4930,Is there any emergency need for money?
4931,It's our responsibility to take care of our parents. 
4932,That is great1
4933,You must have been so proud!
4934,Kids are amazing. How old are they?
4935,Great ages to have lots of fun with.
4936,That is fantastic.  What for?
4937,That is awesome!
4938,What does that mean exactly?
4939,I would love a vacation!
4940,Ps4 is the best system to play on!
4941,I love beating others.
4942,Can you be more specific about what things you had lost in the past?
4943,So you consider yourself a general loser in life?
4944,I am with you.  It is horrendous
4945,I agree with you
4946,Is it still there? 
4947,It sounds like that experience made a lot of amazing memories for you.
4948,I can understand that.  Were you by yourself?
4949,that is good to hear
4950,I wouldn't be so sure of that. Even the best trained dogs can run when given a reason.
4951,Ha Ha. They all are until they run.
4952,That is nice.  What show?
4953,That is really cool
4954,Because of the movie or where you were parked?
4955,It must have been really good to keep you scared afterwards.
4956,That's awesome! what was the project?
4957,you must be very clever
4958,I just got Netflix back.  What is good?
4959,That sounds good.  
4960,Oh no. Thats sad. What was wrong?
4961,"Im sorry. That must have been hard,"
4962,I could never ever sing.
4963,I can barely even talk!
4964,"Oh, What was your age when you've stolen?"
4965,"It's happening all around. If we're repeating the same, it'll become a bad habit."
4966,They may consider that shoplifting. It would be terrible to go to jail for grapes.
4967,I think I would stop doing that. Jail doesn't appeal to me.
4968,Cool. Are they still the same?
4969,Are you gonna get together again?
4970,Did you party after?
4971,I partied like crazy after graduation.
4972,Don't be daft! Kids should never watch tv!
4973,They have tv inside the school do they not?
4974,"Even I love anime and i stopped watching tv a few years ago, maybe I shall return."
4975,Well that's understandable.
4976,What kind of job was it?
4977,Oh wow!  I have actually worked there too
4978,I love apple pie. I feel you.
4979,You brought yourself. I am a glass half full type of lady lol
4980,You are  lucky to be able to have that kind of relationship. 
4981,You have a strong foundation. Even if she wavers she will return.
4982,We will see. Don't worry so much.
4983,Good for you. I like a positive attitude.
4984,I hate when that happens
4985,Being courteous isnt that hard. People just dont try
4986,Yeah? What do you need to buy?
4987,How many kids do you have?
4988,Cool What are you going to do?
4989,Well thats good if its quiet.
4990,Why and what did happen?
4991,"Oh, be positive, try your best."
4992,Oh well it wasnt on purpose. People lose things.
4993,Really? Why? They're so small.
4994,Oh no! Have you put traps down?
4995,Ok. Had any interviews yet?
4996,Lol. Well good luck. Job searches can be tough.
4997,You will.
4998,Those are the kind you better keep a watch on. You never know what he might do.
4999,Don't engage with him he will think that your interested.
5000,Is the coworker your friend?
5001,You probably shoulf have told them that wasnt a decent thing to do. 
5002,why
5003,ok
5004,I hope it is - do you have any funny experiences from the bad ones?
5005,I'm sorry to hear that. You'll find somebody good soon!
5006,Really? Are you watching training?
5007,Oh you mean soccer lol
5008,I will agree with you there. We use whatever words we want.
5009,How exciting for you. 
5010,There's always hope in a new beginning.
5011,What was the movie? Save me
5012,Well thanks for nothing lol
5013,I've never had a pair either - but I don't despise them. Why do you feel so strongly?
5014,Yeah - I don't see why someone would spend so much either.
5015,Maybe we're just jealous!
5016,Wow. I have never even tried. Seems complicated.
5017,Maybe I will try one day.
5018,What do you make best?
5019,Never even had it before.
5020,congrats
5021,ya i am interesting to help for people
5022,That's a hard thing to deal with. Do you think she's really hungry?
5023,Maybe her body clock is out of whack.
5024,Whos playing?
5025,Omg. I love her. 
5026,Do you have any of your own?
5027,I'm sure you would with all that experience!
5028,Wow. Was it intersting?
5029,I have no idea who that is. Sorry.
5030,Football or soccer?
5031,Whats your favorite team?
5032,Why do you hide snacks from your kids?
5033,That does not seem very nice.
5034,That's good to hear.
5035,That's good that you can get through and hopefully still care about each other.
5036,I hope you can find the peace and keep up whatever friendship you may have.
5037,That's great. I understand sometimes we might need distance as well. But being cool with the other person is nice to see. 
5038,Right now?
5039,Oh man! I feel sorry for you. What time is it where you are - 1am?
5040,Shame on you. 
5041,Oh wow. Maybe you dodged a bullet.
5042,Me too lol
5043,Is it? Do you like dressing up then? Or is it the tricks?
5044,You can make it every month! Have fancy dress parties for the kids
5045,Excellent!
5046,I bet I enjoyed it when I was 30 and pregnant!
5047,Did you have any money?
5048,That's good he is nice like that.
5049,What kind of test?
5050,Biology isnt as easy as I thought either.
5051,Good luck. Whats the job?
5052,Cool. Ive done that before.
5053,Does she? Do you want me to break her kneecaps for you?
5054,Me too. It's not fair. Just message me her address and $1000 and I'll do it :-)
5055,"Yeah? I'm sorry to hear that. Are you looking for someone else? (Does that sound sleazy, lol?)"
5056,"Oh dear. Maybe you don't need a man - I'm one and can confirm that they are messy, noisy and rude."
5057,It sure can.
5058,DEfinitely
5059,I hate that.
5060,People should be more considerate though.
5061,"Jeesh, was she not paying attention in class, or is there some other issue?"
5062,I couldn't imagine my kid going so far as to hide something like that from me. Maybe she was just scared of how you would react.
5063,"Well you tend to be a bit overly serious about things, maybe you should try looking at the issue from her point of view you know?"
5064,"She is a kid man, kids mess up. I can't imagine you were a beacon of honesty when you were a kid. "
5065,Thats cool.
5066,Oh. You're welcome lol
5067,I read your journal
5068,Im sldo in your closet
5069,Really? Why is that?
5070,Oh no! How does that make you feel?
5071,I know right
5072,Why are you done with voting?
5073,You shouldn't give up on your government.
5074,I hate horror films Too many nightmares.
5075,Whose idea were those anyway?
5076,Oh no
5077,That was nice. 
5078,Probably Im scared of birds.
5079,It flies. I am afraid of butterflies. Seriously
5080,"Well its to be expected, all you do is sit in your house on the weekends. "
5081,"Well next weekend come out with me and the rest of the group, bet we could find you a few interested guys."
5082,Well lets not aim too high. How about we start with good looking and go from there.
5083,"Oh shoot! What happened, are you okay?"
5084,What happened? I thought you guys were attached at the hip? 
5085,I feel really sorry for you. Will you be okay?
5086,I hope everything works out for you.
5087,"That's nice, do you get nervous?"
5088,"That's great, do you have a warm up routine to get your ready?"
5089,"Cool, what do you do if you happen to be low on energy?"
5090,Makes sense!
5091,oh why?
5092,Was it an important appointment?
5093,"I haven't seen it, but I know a lot of people like it. "
5094,"Sounds good, were you said throughout the series or because of an ending?"
5095,I appreciate that! I wish I had watched it so you could talk more about it. 
5096,What about it is annoying? Isnt it better for the dog?
5097,that does not seem safe for anyone. Is there anything you can do about it?
5098,I'm sorry to hear that. Are you OK?
5099,Oh man. That's so sad.
5100,That sounds like fun.
5101,"I love the sunshine, it's great."
5102,I can understand that viewpoint. It's a very complicated issue though!
5103,Well done! Do you get a prize or anything?
5104,That's great. Keep up the good work
5105,Why do you think you often feel that way?
5106,Do you have any friends around that area?
5107,That IS annoying.
5108,"That is wonderful, good food makes for happy people"
5109,thats my favorite food too! no wonder it was lovely. you should cook italian food often then
5110,Why not? That doesn't sound fun.
5111,"I'm sorry the hear that, maybe next time."
5112,Absolutely. What happened?
5113,That's bad. Did any charges get pressed?
5114,What kind of job do you want?
5115,Accounting jobs are usually high paying j.
5116,"Oh, wow. That's awful, I'm sorry!"
5117,I understand. Will your insurance help you?
5118,What was the hard work?
5119,Good. WEll done then.
5120,"Wow!  Never mind, the best is reserved  for the last"
5121,Don't give up! 
5122,What did she say?
5123,Congratulations. That's amazing!
5124,That is great news.  He must be lucky.
5125,It seems like everything worked out for him.
5126,Afraid of what?
5127,Can you provide more details?
5128,really?
5129,What do you mean?
5130,really - do you feel confident?
5131,So what  made it fondly? 
5132,Nice!  Was it on a summer time? 
5133,Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself. Will you celebrate?
5134,"I agree, be sure to keeping up the good work! "
5135,"Oh no, what happened to the car?"
5136,"Wow, that is so disgusting."
5137,I agree. I thinking making a list helps with that.
5138,I like to have a set of goals for the week to accomplish.
5139,Did you mess on the order?
5140,Wow.You must feel angry about that
5141,"That sounds amazing, good for you!"
5142,How surprised were you about it?
5143,I hope you didnt get any bad news from the doctor.
5144,I am sorry to hear that. Hopefully its a treatable disease! 
5145,"Uhmnn, so how do you  think  she would react? "
5146,"Anyway  you have to find a way of better explaining  ,hope he'll  understand? "
5147,That is unfortunate. You must have really angry to have wasted your time.
5148,It has happened to me as well. Its very annoying when it happens.
5149,What did he do to you?
5150,"You should not lend money to anyone,even if it is your friend"
5151,Really - are you scared of missing it?
5152,Me too - I get very stressed if there's even a chance of being late.
5153,That shouldn't be allowed in the first place.
5154,Oh my. I would be angry if that happened too.
5155,What?  Was that freezed to have stayed that long? 
5156,Uhmmnn!  That's awful!  
5157,What game were you playing?
5158,"Wow, I am so happy for you!"
5159,Good job! A good education is great for your future.
5160,It is very much worth it in the long run.
5161,Congratulation. Good job.
5162,Good. Self confidence is important. When did you get the promotion?
5163,Oh my. How did that happen? I hope no one was hurt
5164,Does your insurance cover fire damage?
5165,OK get prepared! 
5166,"Well, can only wish you luck!  You need to be bold "
5167,Is it not about 2 years away?
5168,OK - are you going to go to Tokyo to see it?
5169,"Am so sorry,  how did you handle it?"
5170,That can be tiresome. I hope you had it all handled at the end
5171,"That's terrible, will you be able to stay in school?"
5172,"Well, I hope you do better this year."
5173,yes it appears a trade war might happen now!
5174,"I agree, he needs to stop isolating the U.S."
5175,That is a great surprise. Did you drive it?
5176,You are very lucky.
5177,It ran away? Better make sure can't do that again. Stressful 
5178,I can imagine so
5179,I am in the US. Why does it make you so angry? I've never heard about.
5180,"I think I will, I'm very curious now. You think they would want to use their time more wisely."
5181,Oh man that's a good way to end up on the couch.
5182,You better find a way to make that up to her.
5183,Why is that? Is it your favorite type of car?
5184,"I see, turn that jealousy into motivation to get that Acura!"
5185,Congratulations. We have a boy on the way. 3 months to go!
5186,I remember my surprise too. She tricked me all day and said she wasn't pregnant.
5187,"Well, that really  bad!  "
5188,"Well ,that goodness you were not caught, that would have been expulsion "
5189,The customized version of what?
5190,Oh okay. What kind of car is it?
5191,Oh wow that seems like a bad situation. 
5192,Is there another company that may be able to help you?
5193,What a happy time I bet you were very prouod and excited!! :-
5194,Yay that is awesome! Sometimes not knowing the gender of the baby is a very cool surprise they say.
5195,Nice!  What is your favorite dish that she taught you?
5196,Awww I am sorry.  At least she showed you how to make it!
5197,Oh wow. That sounds like me and my husband!
5198,"That would make me mad, too. How hard is it to throw stuff away?"
5199,That makes me so sad. Why is that so?
5200,yes that can be a huge problem. I'm so sorry you're having to go through that.
5201,"Of course, I've felt sad for many reasons. Things that happen in the world make me sad."
5202,What makes me sad is hunger in the world. I cannot stand people suffering.
5203,That is a reason to be sad but also to be furious
5204,All people are the same.I understand why you feel ver sad and I guess frustrated too
5205,Sorry to hear that. Why is that?
5206,That must have been very upsetting. It happened to me back in 6th grade.
5207,So did you get in trouble for it?
5208,That would make me so mad!   I wouldn't even want to go to work!
5209,That is pretty gross but it happens often.
5210,If you plan on having a kid it will happen.
5211,That sounds like so much fun!
5212,I like the little roller coasters myself.
5213,have they offered to buy you a replacement?
5214,Thats not a very good friend then. accidents happen but you should own up to them :/ have you considered suing in small claims? youd at least get your money back to get a new phone
5215,Sorry to hear that.IS she going to be under treatment?
5216,Thats pretty kind of you.WHat is the doctor saying?
5217,"Yes, they are. They keep us motivated."
5218,My main one is to become a mother. I also want to be out of debt ASAP.
5219,Have you talked to him about being a bit cleaner in general?
5220,"Ah that's a tough situation. Maybe some subtle hints would work best, like leaving a deodorizer near his room."
5221,Oh that sounds like fun! What kind of film did you see?
5222,Action films on the big screen are very exciting with the loud sounds and visual effects!!
5223,Do you want to do something special today?
5224,you can read something
5225,That must've been hard. I love my dad the most of all family members
5226,I'm glad to hear that.
5227,What did happen in the store? Why did your daughter throw a fit?
5228,"Oh, did you convince her?"
5229,thats so adorable! how old is he? 
5230,i bet i would be too 
5231,oh cool how much was it? 
5232,holy! thats a lot but she will get good use out of it 
5233,oh my god 
5234,Well done. You must be very proud of him.
5235,Football is pretty much the only sport I like.
5236,"How did you feel, relieved or disappointed?"
5237,Did they reschedule?
5238,And what happened then?
5239,Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself.
5240,What did you do instead? 
5241,well you could always take him out or do something he would like to make up for it im sure he wont mind 
5242,I am sure that brought back memories
5243,I do love those kind of memories
5244,What are you worried about?
5245,"Ahh, well I am sure you will have blast!"
5246,Oh no! Are you ok?
5247,I'm sorry to hear that. What caused the fire?
5248,"Oh, tell me what happened."
5249,That sounds like a very eventful day!
5250,thats so cool where were you when you seen that? 
5251,i would have been too thats really cool 
5252,that happens to everyone
5253,i hope she forgave you
5254,Well done to you. Its not so easy to lose weight. What motivated you?
5255,Having a good looking body is not just to look good its also a reflection of a healthy life. You should try and keep it.
5256,"It's a good attitude, it keeps you young"
5257,keep like this ... happy
5258,I've been there. That must be rough. What's going on ?
5259,I am happy you worked it out. Stay loyal to each other. It's the most important thing
5260,What are you overwhelmed by
5261,I am sure it will begin soon
5262,omg.. sounds terrible.. do you usually get storms like that in your area? 
5263,it sounds like it well i am glad everyone is okay 
5264,"I'm sorry, how did she take it?"
5265,Hopefully she will forgive you for it.
5266,It must have been quite interesting. Did it make you feel hungry?
5267,"Oh my, I can see why. It must have been very noisy and animal-like"
5268,Then? 
5269,Where are you camping? 
5270,Who did? And I'm sorry to hear that.
5271,I am sorry for your loss. 
5272,thats a terrible situation you are in has it been resolved? 
5273,Yeah that sounds really bad! 
5274,"I see, it will be alright. You just have to be positive!"
5275,"You must be feel a bit guilty, but thats okay"
5276,How long did he study for? 
5277,awesome good for him... what will his career choice me now? 
5278,I am sure they will do fine
5279,She sounds creative
5280,That is an example of an awesome parent.  It is good to know he has got your back!
5281,I am sure it really helped your self confidence and feelings of worth.
5282,That sounds so annoying
5283,Just be civil as much as you can
5284,"Well, it is a good thing you had so much faith in your father."
5285,It is good you had someone so reliable in your life.
5286,I bet you were good at it
5287,That is pretty impressive
5288,Oh wow.  Have you ever been in a torando?
5289,People tend to say that...which makes me more curious and wanting to be in one haha
5290,"I'm sorry, I think it's an opportunity to start a new job better"
5291,that's right ... but you have to keep going ... I know that you will do well
5292,... I congratulate you ... it's good news!
5293,that gives a lot of confidence ....
5294,i believe this story please tell me ore
5295,such a manly thing to do dont you agree ?
5296,So...what did you do
5297,smart
5298,That sounds like a blast. Who are you going to see?
5299,"That is fun, is it an inside thing or outside?"
5300,whaaat that is insane! Alright he must be doing something really LEGAL right? lol 
5301,some people really are like that though. I am not one of those people tho. 
5302,I agree but you do not need much in life to be happy if you are a content person
5303,i am happy for you
5304,"Maybe, but maybe not. I bet it would be a lot of fun to have such a nice pool if you had the money for it. "
5305,I mean I would never be able to afford that but if they can then it is nothing for them to do the routine care.
5306,did he ?
5307,you have a great dad
5308,wow i closed 2 weeks ago
5309,it truly is
5310,were you drunk? 
5311,lol well atleast you are honest! 
5312,hope he takes care of it
5313,"you are a good friend,  i would never let my friend borrow mine"
5314,that literally makes no sense like i get it you are homeless but no reason to be dirty! ugh 
5315,probably so either way still disgusting 
5316,"Well, go ahead, know that women are an art, that you get many attempts"
5317,"quiet, we're like that ... you're right"
5318,You're not alone I've got a bunch of debt to pay off
5319,For now I just sweep it under the rug and pretend like it doesn't exist. So after that point my life is pretty much perfect
5320,"i am so proud of you, keep it up "
5321,you are probably older now as well
5322,Sometimes you've gotta live with regrets.  Accept it as part of your past life and move on
5323,Same I've put my parents through a lot.  But now I'm trying to be the best version of myself so I can eventually pay them back
5324,that is a very positive way to think i wish i could think like you 
5325,ill try my best and see where it gets me 
5326,"I know, it's awful! How much did your rent go up?"
5327,Wow...You need to find a new place to live because that's completely unreasonable.
5328,That's gross! Did you complain to your landlord?
5329,"Wow, that's pretty bad. I would complain to someone higher up, because that's just disgusting! "
5330,"you sound so motivated, that's really great! I believe in you"
5331,It does motivate me too! 
5332,I do remember that and I think there is a lot of nostalgia there
5333,"I love things that remind me of my childhood, it is even more fun to share it with our kids"
5334,Really! What was it?
5335,That sounds amazing! What was in the box???
5336,I think most people are really.  Anything specific about it?
5337,"Yeah, that's a scary thought.  I try to think about what I can leave behind, and hope there's something past death."
5338,"Oh, that's awful. What will you do to make it right?"
5339,"Yeah, I think that's a good idea. I hope it all turns out for good."
5340,"Oh no!  It seems as though everything turned our OK, right?  I am sure you were strong!"
5341,That is great!  It was all worth it in the end.
5342,Oh my!  I am glad to hear you managed to avoid the collision.
5343,Young people never appreciate the danger of speeding.
5344,what are you getting done
5345,"ouch , gargle some whiskey"
5346,give her an unlocked phone 
5347,is she being billed for data though ?
5348,that's not nice of them. is that parking lot assigned to you?
5349,they should be nicer! i'm sorry they are so inconsiderate
5350,"Wow, you're so well spoken. "
5351,so how do you better yourself?
5352,Maybe there is rain in the forecast
5353,"Probably a lot are on vacation  ,especially now."
5354,I'm sorry to hear that.  Did they replace the plant as well?
5355,I hope it comes back.  Fertilizer is always an experimental thing. Plants are so finicky.
5356,Oh wow! I remember my parents getting them so much. Why would someone need that now?
5357,"Possibly, but I doubt it could be worth anything. I would have thrown it out."
5358,did you cry ?
5359,i love the old days as well
5360,"Oh my, that must have been super embarrassing. Did you get red faced?"
5361,Did you ask for her number afterwards?
5362,"That seemed nice of her, maybe she felt bad about something?"
5363,Oh so she gave you money to kind of persuade you to do it?
5364,uhhh i know how you feel!! we have some young neighbors downstairs and sometimes they have late night parties in their apartment
5365,tell me about it. i even talked to them several times but they don't care
5366,That must have been amazing to see!  Did you try to scare it away or just watch it?  Be careful since it sounds like it may be dangerous.
5367,Wow!  Definitely be careful then!
5368,"That was some bonus. If you go to I think South carolina, they have a factory somewhere there and they are cheaper I think"
5369,A friend got one used down there near Spartanburg.
5370,"Aw, well I'm sure a child that young doesn't really need it."
5371,Well maybe you can practice and get better at it for when your baby is older.
5372,Thats good. One should always appreciate family.
5373,"I see, healthy relationships should be cherished!"
5374,"That is fair, I would be as well"
5375,"I undertstand that, I would be very upset as well"
5376,"That is cool though, does it still run fine?"
5377,"Wow, that is a good run though, great job keeping it running!"
5378,it will
5379,sure
5380,Sorry to hear that. I have lost all my grandparents so I know the feeling. 
5381,"Yeah, it takes a long time to get over .  And it's never easy."
5382,"That is so sad, humans made a huge impact on animals lives in that sense"
5383,"It makes me feel sick as well, I hit a bird once and almost cried"
5384,That's great. It seems that everything is going well for you.
5385,Thanks. I guess you are quite happy about everything.
5386,wow i am happy for you
5387,around christmas right
5388,"I am aspriing to be one, congrats!"
5389,"not yet, I am still young"
5390,I know how you feel.  I have siblings as well.  They are quite important and give life meaning.
5391,That is a great attitude and outlook to have!
5392,I am so sorry to hear that!
5393,I unsderstand that entirely
5394,"I've been there, it can really suck to be lonely.  It sounds like you're doing better though :)"
5395,I'm glad to hear it.  It's great to have found someone.
5396,why is that?
5397,Weren't we are like that...
5398,"That will be a ton of fun to play!  I rememeber when the first one came out, what a blast.  Now I have to go get a switch!"
5399,What is your favorite game?
5400,"I would imagine, that is a huge event! My favorite game was Zelda by the way"
5401,"You should, there are tons of age appropriate games like Mario Kart and Splatoon!"
5402,Sounds interesting. I'd love to check that out!
5403,"It's a Mario-type game, isn't it?"
5404,"Lebron is preparing for life after basketball therefore he picked LA, he achieved what he wanted "
5405,He doesn't have anything else to prove to anyone
5406,Mine too.  How many do you have?
5407,"awww, a 1 year old.  I miss when my daughter was that young."
5408,maybe he was not watching where HE was going
5409,at least he didnt hit you
5410,"Thaqt is too bad.  I like cats, but not the mean ones, only the sweet ones.  What does the cat do that is so bad?"
5411,"Yeah, I wonder what has made it so mean."
5412,"hi, that's sad. have you tried looking for facebook events? like local events. i bet you can meet people there"
5413,You can always talk to me. i'm here for you
5414,It is a interesting and relaxing way to end a evening. Ive been there before.
5415,"Sorry to hear that.All we can do is learn from it,really."
5416,"Oh my gosh, how terrible. Did you have them saved on your computer?"
5417,I guess you had to redo it all again?
5418,"That is terrible, is it someone you like? or did you not even know her?  I don't know which is worse."
5419,"Can you laugh about it now that you look back at it, or has not enough time passed yet?"
5420,"Oh my, did you find out who it was?"
5421,You must have been quite relived that it was just your dog!
5422,"That is a relief Ive been in a similiar situation.  I know its hard to bring yourself out of a hole, I can barely see the light at the end of the tunnell"
5423,"Im struggling myself, with 5 kids and 1 big kid (my husband) I feel like I should just buy a farm to be able to keep up. LOL"
5424,i'm sorry to hear that. i hate when my wife and i argue. are you feeling any better? did you have a chance to talk to your husband after that?
5425,i hope everything will go back to normal asap and i hope he will apologize for making you feel small
5426,"Holy cow, why did you take that bet?"
5427,What was the bet about?
5428,"Good for you, healthy relationships are the best part about life!"
5429,"I agree, going through life alone would be boring!"
5430,"That is awesome, I am trying my best these days"
5431,"That is good, that takes a lot of work!"
5432,did you drink a lot back then >:
5433,i am glad you are in a better place now
5434,That's awesome! It sounds like your life is going pretty smoothly :) Any big plans?
5435,Oh awesome! Did you buy a house?
5436,When you feel rain ... sometimes you feel its magic ... ask the children
5437,you're right ... then the umbrella always at hand
5438,"of everything, there is always something to learn"
5439,good luck with your learning
5440,did y0u get it ?
5441,awesome does it pay well ?
5442,How young were you?
5443,"That is not bad then, that is being a kid"
5444,sounds like your life is perfect. that's amazing. i'm happy for you
5445,where do you work?
5446,"That is amazing, that is a huge life event!"
5447,That is crazy how time flies like that! Next thing you know he will have a girlfriend
5448,Blood is blood.
5449,That is correct. It painful to see your loved ones been hurt
5450,"Wow, congrats, I know that is not a fun process at all, so great job!"
5451,Indeed. That is the whole purpose of getting a degree and education. Isn't it?
5452,"Well, it can also depend of your communication skills and how you can entice employers"
5453,"That is great, is it far from home?"
5454,"That is not bad at all, best of luck with that!"
5455,That is a lot to be thankful for!  You must be feeling really good!
5456,That is a great place to be.  Count your blessings!
5457,"Which system was it? My message got cut short, but I love nintendo, the switch is amazing!"
5458,i bet you did and i'm sure you got the job
5459,what do you do
5460,How far away is that? I have never heard of it!
5461,"Oh, that should be awesome, have a great time!"
5462,"Oh man, so sorry dude. Hope your coping."
5463,Why did she break up with you? Was it a long term relationship? 
5464,"I agree, I often reminisce about my childhood. "
5465,"You just have to stay positive dude, happiness is a relative concept."
5466,Audis are nice cars. What color is it? Does it look newer?
5467,"Oh, nice. Do you have a car?"
5468,that is very thoughtful of you
5469,you are very ambitious
5470,about what may I ask?
5471,"Is the person someone you know well, a long time friend, a family member?"
5472,I would talk to your brother and let him know how concerned you are and ask him for reassurance 
5473,That's so nice of them! Was it a surprise party?
5474,Hahaha We take those things for granted! Happy belated birthday!
5475,I can imagine it caught many people off guard.  I hope everyone came out ok in the end.
5476,That's good.  The only thing that matters in the end is our lives and health.
5477,its never too late
5478,i for one have not start saving yet
5479,"According to my knowledge and understanding, I believe that you did something really prudent"
5480,Moderation in driving is important to avoid dangerous situations
5481,oh my that must be embarresing
5482,well that sounds more pleasant
5483,Is that your brewski of choice
5484,Always been a fan of Corona though lately I've been chugging Hurricanes and Keystones
5485,"oh, i bet you are nervous. I'm sure she will be okay but i would be so nervus"
5486,"That's great! i see you trust her so much, you have wonderful relationship with her"
5487,It's alright maybe it's a working day and she has a surprise for you on saturday
5488,Did you check everywhere in the room? maybe she has a surprise  gift hidden somewhere for you to find out
5489,I think you should call the cab company and try to locate the driver!
5490,Yes I will pray as well. But try not to let it bite your conscience. 
5491,but that's so exciting! you will have so many good moments in your new house
5492,I understand. is your new house far from the old one?
5493,"I understand that, I hate bugs, even alive ones"
5494,"I get that, I am the same way"
5495,That is very sweet. I assume you guys are close.
5496,That is great that you have that kind of relationship.
5497,Was your house okay?
5498,"Good, being safe is all you can ask for!"
5499,My boyfriend just bought a Nintendo Switch last week. It was expensive!
5500,I will have to ask him about the Super Smash Bro's game. Most likely he's looking forward to it as well!
5501,He was dirty and I had to bathe him very thoroughly.
5502,"Blood's thicker than water, whether you like it or not"
5503,tell me why
5504,"That sounds fun though, I am a lightweight, after about 5 drinks I am about out of it"
5505,"I like Vodka, but mixed with stuff to kill the taste, I hate beer though, it is nasty to me"
5506,you should go
5507,it could have been worse you know
5508,That is great! I bet they are thrilled! Is that you favorite team?
5509,They are pretty talented.
5510,"That sucks.  It's the same for me, only it's because we recently moved and I don't know anyone outside of work yet."
5511,Ouch.  Were you too busy to go with them?
5512,are they alive or gone ?
5513,yes they will believe in it
5514,"I know that was the case for many, I am sorry that impacted you "
5515,"Many people did, he was a likeable fellow!"
5516,"That has happened to me,kids are brutal"
5517,"That is for sure, with online bullying existing now too"
5518,That makes me sad to hear.  Do you have lot's of friends now?
5519,I think it is better to a few really good friends than a lot of acquaintances.
5520,Glad you're doing well
5521,What are three traits that got you to where you are now
5522,Nice talking to ya
5523,I love nintendo and that series
5524,what system do you have
5525,How old were you?
5526,"Ah okay, that makes sense, at least it was sort of legal!"
5527,oh my thats pretty funny
5528,hahaha you are funny
5529,Oh wow that was brave. Did you get caught?
5530,That was pretty risky. Did you get sick?
5531,I saw one for the first time ever too! Where did you see it at?
5532,I was in the US when I saw it thought it has been a while since it happened.
5533,Well that's good news.
5534,What kind of work do you do
5535,Well you shouldn't fear things we have no control over anyway. I'm sorry you feel anxiety over this.
5536,I guess I can agree with that. I don't like it when people criticize millenialls too much though. Baby boomers didn't do that great either.
5537,Why?  What happened??
5538,That stinks.  Are there any other possibilities for advancement coming up?
5539,I know the feeling.I miss my 2 boys also
5540,"I imagine, but i am sure the family will be reunited soon."
5541,Why do you think people would be that irresponsible? 
5542,"Not all people would be that way, and I think for the most part most people would take responsibility for their actions. "
5543,Uh oh. Did he ruin some furniture?
5544,That is too bad. I bet you were not happy.
5545,My brother did too! He's the oldest so he got all the good stuff :(
5546,Aw :( I bet other people appreciate you a lot!
5547,"I hear you.  Jokes are one thing, family is another."
5548,"I dunno if I'd go quite that far, but you do you :P"
5549,I bet you were glad you made that purchase!
5550,That was very lucky timing.
5551,It is so frustrating when someone else's issues affect your life.  What does she do to make you late?
5552,That might be a good solution for you.  Let her catch all the flack for her tardiness.
5553,That is absolutely horrible! Was this recent?
5554,I agree. You should bring that up to HR. 
5555,"Seems like this speech was very important to you, why?"
5556,"Ah-ah, than it makes a lot of sense."
5557,That's awesome! Are you excited?
5558,How long did it take you to make it?
5559,That's an unfortunate predicament to be in.  What did you end up doing?
5560,"That's a tough decision for sure, but you definitely can't get fired for something like that, and kids are exposed to germs all the time."
5561,I get nostalgia all the time.  Were they family pictures
5562,Cool.  Do you still keep in touch with those friends
5563,That is a good approach! Has it been successful?
5564,That is great to hear! I am happy for you!
5565,its really more disapponted and hurts a lot.
5566,dont feel everything goes good 
5567,yeah that good 
5568,iam always happy to think about it. my childhood memory was a great part of our life
5569,Nice! Where at
5570,Cool traveling what are your plans so far
5571,"Ah, I've made plenty of dumb choices in my life too. Honestly, I think it's part of being young"
5572,That's good :) But you are the wiser for it
5573,I know. The game was full of intrigue. They truly deserved the win
5574,You should definitely get a tattoo of his name on your chest
5575,I am so sorry to hear that.  Losing a loved one is definitely one of the hardest things in life.
5576,Maybe they just need some time to let the emotions settle a bit.
5577,sounds fun how long were you there
5578,aw what was your favorite things to do while there
5579,Congratulations.  What did you get your degree in?
5580,Good luck with any future business ventures.
5581,I am very sorry for your loss.
5582,A loss is never easy especially one in the family.
5583,"That is so cool, what kind of video game was it?"
5584,That is so amazing.  Are you a professional gamer? 
5585,I wish I was that good at gaming.  What a fun way to make a living!
5586,"that is a great news, congratulate him from my side too. what is the major?"
5587,"If the journey is tough then you are in the right path. So, she is heading in right way. Great."
5588,Nice! What did you whip up today
5589,"I LOVE steak..just had some steak, brisket and fajitas yesterday"
5590,"thats an amazing memory to have, have you since visited her or sent her a card? "
5591,I would call the school and see if they can disclose that or maybe they can accept the card from you to give to her! 
5592,Oh no!  I'm so sorry!  I hope you could pull your grade up!
5593,What a nice person you are! I bet she appreciates you
5594,"You have a good set of morals. That's becoming more uncommon lately. So, good on you!"
5595,I am sure the stress will be worth it in the end.  Just keep encouraging him!
5596,Those are good traits to have.  Good for him!
5597,"It is a great desire that you can achieve, just rely on your abilities to independently do what you know."
5598,I wish you can achieve success in your projects.
5599,Did you present?
5600,That is great!
5601,Is it something you enjoy? 
5602,I know we are all different but maybe getting another puppy would help? 
5603,Oh that is so scary! I bet you were terrified!
5604,Were you unharmed though?
5605,"Lol , I think my son has done that , he use to embrasse me when I would go to the store when he was little by crying a lot "
5606,"No any more he is a lot older and does pretty good on his own , but the thing is he is always close by if we in the store together .Yes I do believe that the human are weird "
5607,I'm guessing you're talking about your son?
5608,"Parenting is hard, respect to you and your patience"
5609,That is awful! I hate people who leave their dogs out all day. That's no life for a dog to live at all.
5610,That is terrible. I don't know why people like that bother getting a pet. 
5611,that is so beautiful! how old is she? 
5612,i bet it was omg thats so adorable 
5613,that is so scary.... you must have been terrified your baby too! How are you doing today? 
5614,I cant even begin to imagine honestly im sorry you had to experience that 
5615,That is horrible!  How could they justify doing that?  You must have been disgusted with them!
5616,I can imagine.  I hope it all works out for the best and that you are able to come away from this as a stronger person.
5617,Congrats.  They must be excited.
5618,I am sorry to hear that.   Why are you upset about this?
5619,That is terribly sad. I volunteer at our local shelter. I just love dogs.
5620,That is so happy to hear! It's the nice things like that that make it worth it to volunteer.
5621,"Wow, I bet that was a really big deal!  What was it about?"
5622,I hope he did well.
5623,I think a lot of people are.  What in particular astonishes you?
5624,"Yes, he's definitely unpredictable and capricious.  Is there anything about him you do like?"
5625,Oh wow that must have kept you awake for a while!
5626,"She scared me too, I hope you're not scarred for life!"
5627,I know that feeling.  It's a trip when I look through family albums
5628,Do you still keep in touch with the homies
5629,"I would enjoy the peace and quiet!  Kick back, relax, and do whatever you want."
5630,Well in that case I hope they come home soon.  My family is just annoying mostly.
5631,"I have not, I was hoping they called you instead."
5632,That sounds like good planning to me.
5633,I do too. I don't like to think about it because I start to feel weird.
5634,That is awesome. Things change a lot out of high school.
5635,Great.Did you decided were to go on your vacations?
5636,I have been there before.Your are gonna have a lot of fun.
5637,what exactly were you referring to
5638,oh try to politely get the truth by speaking in a diplomatic manner by not hurting her ego
5639,That's great! How old is she?
5640,If she is really good she could get a scholarship.
5641,Why did she get sick? What was wrong?
5642,"Oh no, I'm sorry! I hope she is feeling better, and you are too!"
5643,Yeah me too. They are unbelievable. 
5644,Yeah it is hard to imagine how they pulled that off.
5645,Great. I hope you have a lot of fun.
5646,5 years is a long time.You have a lot to catch-up.
5647,"Wow, how did he get so much money if he didn't have money to pay his fees, and what were the fees for?"
5648,What a great job to get. 
5649,"It must have been an overwhelming experience, how old are the kids now?"
5650,"Sweet, we all miss those memories of them growing back. Mine are adults now"
5651,Why did you feel irritated? 
5652,Oh that sounds super annoying! Sorry for that!
5653,That is so sad! That poor dog.
5654,Oh it survived! What a lucky dog.
5655,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. The only thing that helps is time unfortunately."
5656,"After some time passes though, you'll wonder why you were so sad."
5657,I think he should exercise more self-restraint when it comes to your relationship
5658,That is very dangerous attitude to have. I would be very cautious as it may bring much unintended social consequences
5659,do you act surprised ?
5660,did you drink a lot ?
5661,How does he go about showing it off? 
5662,that sounds really childish of him lol 
5663,"Did you apologize, and do something nice to make up for it?"
5664,"Wow!  Well, everyone makes mistakes, and if you apologized and bought her a ring, that should about cover it, lol."
5665,You should be proud of the fact you have a new home to build a lifetime of memories in.
5666,You all have reason to celebrate.  You should throw a huge party to thank them.
5667,Wow! Congrats! I've heard that's very difficult to do.
5668,Good for you. Do you feel any different health wise?
5669,Oh yeah? What job did you apply for?
5670,"That's great! I really hope you do get it, you sound very excited."
5671,Cool what did you get?
5672,"Nice, what brand was it?"
5673,I've only heard a little about them but they're a good brand! Did you get it yet or are you still waiting?
5674,That sounds like fun! I love family time!
5675,Yes it sure is! We must appreciate the things that money cant buy too!
5676,Oh that is so scary! What happened after?
5677,Oh no. I hope everything worked out okay!
5678,Nice!  Did you use that extra to do anything special?
5679,"That's probably the best choice.  I was thinking you could use it to spruce up a new place a bit, which it sounds like you did :)"
5680,That sounds like a really fun and joyful surprise.  Young birthdays are amazing.
5681,"Yeah, after 21 they really are pointless.  Most of my birthdays, I enjoy a good dose of work all day, lol."
5682,I think that would be a very wise idea.
5683,Are you working a full time job?
5684,I am sorry to hear that. I know that would be hard.
5685,I hope things get better for you.
5686,Did you try to reason with them?
5687,You should report them to the authorities
5688,thats so awesome....... what uni is it? 
5689,impressive my god! you really must be so proud... 
5690,"Yeah I love that feeling, you need to cherish it!"
5691,"That's good, try to figure out what caused it!"
5692,god.... did you have any extra clothes or able to change? 
5693,sounds like a good reason to leave maybe i should spill juice on myself too lol 
5694,"Cool congrats, what did you eat?"
5695,Well a promotion is always good. Did you have a burrito?
5696,A dog is an awesome gift for a little kid.  I bet you were super excited.
5697,"I bet!  Maybe I should get my kids a dog for Christmas, I know it would be a great choice for them."
5698,Trimming down on the junk food? 
5699,"Oh okay I see. I understand, being healthy is important. I hope you are being sensitive to her feelings though, weight can be a touchy subject!"
5700,Your husband is just being a good daddy  hahaha you will miss the experience when the kid grows up
5701,"Then talk with him, try to reason with him"
5702,"That sucks, but being lonely can sometimes help you discover new hobbies."
5703,"Yes, your happiness doesn't depend on nobody else."
5704,That's no fair! Where you left out on purpose?
5705,Yeah I would be upset about that too.
5706,what orchestra was it or where was it? 
5707,sounds very cool id love to go listen someday 
5708,Turbulence always scares me lol. In reality the plane is very safe though.
5709,How often do you fly? The more you do it the easier it gets.
5710,Cool I lived in Palm Beach County for 2 years. I fly to the Philippines every few years and it takes over 12 hours!
5711,That is so sad.  It sucks to end any relationship.
5712,That seems like a pretty crazy reason to throw away four years.  I am sorry that happened to you.
5713,I feel your pain. It's crazy how reckless some drivers can be. I was always taught the importance of using my signals.
5714,Honestly in Florida I see similar behaviors among some drivers. I'm not sure if they are rushing or just don't care.
5715,That's cool I guess...do your parents not trust you in their own house? lol
5716,Gotcha. Well glad it worked out for ya
5717,someone forget to pay the bill? 
5718,that is a very good story
5719,I bet. That's so sweet.
5720,Were you able to record the moment?
5721,"That's unfortunate, did you end up with a ticket?"
5722,"Ouch, I hope it wasn't too expensive."
5723,I havent played video games in years I really need to buy a system but I dont even know where to begin now adays lol 
5724,I liked it better when it said releash I figured you had a lisp. ( lol joking ) I will check into it! thanks 
5725,Did you need the money for something specific? 
5726,Were you able to sleep last night?
5727,Did you get hurt?
5728,Glad to hear that.
5729,I always get nervous too... never know what they will find right ! Whats wrong? 
5730,jeez thank god! ugh glad you are okay 
5731,"I can understand, the holidays are exciting, almost there though."
5732,I hope it's worth the wait!
5733,That is nice of you. Family is great to have when you get older.
5734,Yes it is. I am glad you are there for your grandmother!
5735,"Oh no, that is really sad. You should research your dog's allergies so that it does not happen with other foods."
5736,That is great! I hope your dog gets better fast.
5737,Oh I bet that was super frustrating! How did you react?
5738,Younger siblings tend to be that way sometimes.
5739,Great where are you going?
5740,"I agree, it's better to overpack than underpack."
5741,I am so sorry to hear that!  Don't worry.  I know it is hard but every day will get better.
5742,Just be strong.  She is in a better place now.
5743,How exciting! Why did you choose Tahiti?
5744,The photos of Tahitian beaches I've seen are beautiful! Will you be visiting a beach?
5745,"Oh no! Was she okay, or did she cry?"
5746,"That is good, I'm glad she was okay. I once got hit in the face with one, so I know it can sting."
5747,I am sorry to hear that. Can I ask why?
5748,I don't think you should feel ashamed at all. Parent's are there to help you until you are able to manage on your own.
5749,and how do you feel about it? Are you ready?
5750,"Then that's good! I am glad you feel confident, that will help!"
5751,"That is a great idea! I need to do that as well, seems I always forget something!"
5752,That is great! I'm happy for you!
5753,"Oh no, I hope it wasn't unwarranted!"
5754,"It's definitely a difficult position to be in, I hope your coworkers were understanding."
5755,"Omg, how many months were you pregnant before this happened?"
5756,i'm so sorry to hear about this
5757,Oh that is a tough one! You have to tell her no matter what! Just suck it up and break it to her!
5758,"I know you are scared, but this was a choice you made, now you have to deal with the consequences."
5759,We will always have fond memories that come to our minds. I am sorry to hear that but also happy you can have the memoru. 
5760,Yes she is! 
5761,What was the prize you didn't win?
5762,Oh well I'm sure there's always next year! Was it a fitness test or what
5763,It is good you are happy with your current position. What do you do?
5764,That is awesome! I'm happy for you!
5765,"Wow, it must be a very recent and trendy hair style"
5766,You husband must be very happy with the style
5767,I understand a lot of people have issues with him.  What makes you embarrassed?
5768,Well in his business dealings in the past it probably served him well to be blunt and agressive.  I can see how that would bother some people
5769,I am sorry to hear that.Is the poilice helping you.
5770,You should install security cameras around your house.
5771,That is so nice. Moms are the best. You are lucky to have a good one!
5772,"I definitely will! My mom is sick , so I plan on spending all the time with her I can!"
5773,That's so good for you! Are you going to save more money now?
5774,I can imagine! I hope you're able to save a lot and have good financial security.
5775,Do I even wanna hear it? Okay tell me... what happened? :o
5776,So you had chocolate covered ants! I bet thats pricey somewhere in another country! ha ha 
5777,oh man did you forget?
5778,"well hopefully she understands too, you seem pretty guilty about it."
5779,That's sounds like a very smart and effective safety precaution. Was it enough to adequately defend your family?
5780,Did you end up feeling like you had stronger defenses than the hurricane had strength when it reached your area? I mean in an overprotected kind of way.
5781,That is really sad. Many people I grew up with have passed from overdose. It's tragic.
5782,I don't believe it is either. I'm so sorry to hear about your friend.
5783,That is great. Did you buy anything else?
5784,So you have relatively new computer essentials. Sounds like you are set for the next while.
5785,"That sounds cool, what did the circus consist of? Did they have elephants?"
5786,Cool! I haven't been to a circus in years. I think I should go again soon.
5787,That's pretty cool.  It always helps to have someone helping you when you're sick.
5788,"I had a girlfriend who was really caring. Baked me a birthday cake, made me a scarf, and bought me clothes...but I messed it up and we're no long together but you live and you learn"
5789,"oh man, do you miss it? How about your brother?"
5790,oh yeah that's way too cold! I'm sorry you feel a bit homesick. Remember you are away because you are bettering yourself
5791,Ouch!  That had to feel embarrassing!  Did you apologize?
5792,That's good.  That shows your true character.
5793,Wow! That never happens! You must have been so excited! 
5794,I would have bought more tickets hoping I was having good luck after that! 
5795,That's sucks. You must have been devastated when you got the news.
5796,You'll get over it. They're probably up in heaven watching over you now.
5797,I am too actually. I don't care for them at all!
5798,"They're obsessed with guns, what do you expect?"
5799,Are you ok? How is your recovery?
5800,You are lucky to have a top-notch doctor helping you.
5801,"That's great, from the sound of it, your probably thought it was going to be boring, huh?"
5802,That must have been very entertaining to watch then. I'm glad you enjoyed it so much.
5803,"Oh no, are you feeling any better now? Or are you still having problems?"
5804,"Oh, well that sounds like a step in the right direction at least. I hear vocational school is great for many different kind of jobs, usually more physical."
5805,"That is very risky and volatile!  With no risk, there is no reward!  I am rooting for you!"
5806,That is a good position to be in.  There have been millionaires made in crytocurrency.
5807,Oh wow! What's better than a raise? A raise you didn't even expect!
5808,Is it a pretty substantial increase?
5809,That's great. I bet she's never home now.
5810,"I know, time fly's by so fast. Congrats to her. Just tell her to be careful on the road."
5811,I am happy to hear that! Any specific reasons?
5812,Wow that is a huge achievement! Any parent would be proud.
5813,That could happen to anyone.Don't feel so bad.
5814,Keep trying and you will see improvments.
5815,what about friend?
5816,but what about?
5817,That's good launch you gat tere 
5818,ok that is cool
5819,"Oh man, that sucks. You may need to say something to her. "
5820,Hopefully. Maybe she was having a bad day.
5821,Wow! That must've been a surprise 
5822,She must've really enjoyed the time. Where did you guys go out to eat? Was it nice?
5823,Sounds cool! There isn't anything like that around here.
5824,Wow that is a lot of money! Congrats!
5825,"If all else fails, save it!"
5826,Wow! That must have been exciting. Were you nervous?
5827,"Oh, that sucks! Did you relax a bit after take off or were you anxious the whole time?"
5828,"Well, you should.You did a nasty thing."
5829,That really does not make a lot of sense.
5830,what about it?
5831,really? that seems to be an amazing event
5832,I'm not sure.  What baby is it?
5833,"Yeah, that's my baby.  It learned to roll over after about 5 months."
5834,That's horrible! I hope it wasn't a lot of money!
5835,That's happened to me before. I hate trying to get things like that settled.
5836,Oh my God that's terrible!  So sad.  I'd be mad too.  What did you do?
5837,Did the police come? I hope she got her stuff back
5838,No kidding.  I would hate for that to happen to anyone else.
5839,I bet.  The world can be so scary!  I'm glad she was okay
5840,That's cool! It's nice to have someone close that is talented like that and can help with those things.
5841,"I always wish I was good at design. I've tried, but I'm pretty garbage, haha!"
5842,I used to play Madden a lot so I understand the excitement.  It is a fun game
5843,"I do enjoy football, it means that fall is right around the corner and I love the weather"
5844,"Me too, god bless air conditioning"
5845,"True,  heat makes me angry"
5846,"I used to collect too when I was a kid, I still have some but they are probably worth nothing other than nostalgia."
5847,"Oh oh I got you neat!  So stuff you used to play in as a kid.  That is nice of you, sports equipment can be expensive"
5848,"Oh sure, I played football in high school and still have my letter jacket and one really messed up jersey.  I dont think I would ever get rid of them"
5849,College in general tends to be a lot of fun.  Anything in particular?
5850,Sounds like a grand old time.
5851,Why can't you just move away when they smoke?
5852,That seems like a rather complicated situation than.
5853,Have you heard how she's doing at her new job? 
5854,"Yeah, that sounds hard. :/ I'm sorry you're missing her. "
5855,Oh that sounds ominous!
5856,That sounds scary! I hope it all ended okay!
5857,Oh man I hate when that happens...did you dry it off or change to a new pair?
5858,"Dang that sucks.  You should check out the brand Mizzen and Main, I heard it on a Tim Ferriss podcast once...dress shirts and pants that wick away moisture like underarmour"
5859,"I can absolutely see where you're coming from! Growing up my parents were neither wealthy nor very poor, but I feel like I had a great childhood."
5860,"I live pretty minimalist. I have the things I need to enjoy life, like a home gym and a gaming computer while being able to afford living essentials. It doesn't take much for me to be happy."
5861,How fun! That must have been scary to do that!
5862,"That is true! I bet it is taking a lot of time, you must be exhausted!"
5863,Not very good. My insurance might not cover the damages.
5864,Someone scratched my car and slashed my tires.
5865,That is impressive.You must have a super memory.
5866,I know.I was just being sarcastic with you.
5867,"I'm sorry to hear that, do you have positive memories that you can remember them with at least?"
5868,Oh well it's good they're still around.
5869,"oh, sorry to hear this. you just want to make it up clean soon"
5870,you have to find the person who did this.then you should made the mess to clean it up
5871,"I agree, man. Almost nothing feels as good as financial security."
5872,But good lovin' can be a bill.. if you know what I mean.
5873,What do you do to get prepared?
5874,Sounds like somebody's thinking ahead! Do you listen to a lot of Alex Jones
5875,Maybe you could try AA meetings or suggest to your wife that she can go to Al Anon meetings. It's a good first start.
5876,It worked for me and my husband. We were going through the same type of thing for about a year.
5877,Talk to him wisely
5878,Oh I mean talk to him in the way that he will understand. With love so that he reasons with you
5879,I would be too! Have you had time to prepare?
5880,That's good. I'm sure you will do good!
5881,"Ah, I have so many fond memories of playing ball in the yard with my dad!"
5882,That's fantastic :) Nostalgia is an amazing thing
5883,That's amazing! I bet he was elated.
5884,You'll have to congratulate him for me. What a great accomplishment.
5885,You must be so happy? What was the job you got a interview for?
5886,Is the nanny job close to where you live?
5887,Thing very carrefully before making this important decision.
5888,She is probably working hard to provide a better life for the family.
5889,You must be taking good care of her in and out if you know what I mean
5890,I hope you can make her realize how grateful you are by being faithful
5891,Oh me neither! I don't like a cheater!
5892,"Seems simple, but nobody does it that way it seems like."
5893,Oh yeah? What song is it?
5894,"Oh man, just saying that name brings back nostalgia for me!"
5895,"That is great, but I take she is not alive anymore??"
5896,"Well, she is in a better place for sure."
5897,I would have to agree with you there. I don't trust him at all!
5898,I agree. I can't understand how his supporters don't see it! I guess they don't WANT to see it!
5899,You'll be fine. It will be a great learning experience.
5900,"I agree, but the journey makes it worth it. You'll meet new people and have new experiences."
5901,That's awesome.  Do you go kayaking often?
5902,Do you own your own kayak or do you rent?
5903,I want to get a sea kayak (I like to fish)
5904,Its also a lot cheaper than a boat and you can get into the shallow salt flats easy.
5905,That's very irritating! Is it difficult to change the headlights in your truck?
5906,Yeah that shouldn't happen. I hate changing the headlights on my car. They made it really tough to get to.
5907,"I can see the appeal. I have the opposite situation. Tiny sub-compact, but goes a long time on a tank."
5908,Seems incredible but also kind of boring at the same time.
5909,Was anyone else there watching him too?
5910,What did your son do that makes you so happy?
5911,That's great! I'm sure that you are a very proud parent!
5912,Good for you.It looks he is making an effort.
5913,He just proved he loves you a lot.
5914,Why are you anxious about the counry?
5915,"I think we'll be fine.   Peopel talk a lot about a trade war but, leave out the fact that places like the EU already tax our goods at much higher rates than we tax theirs.      How can they call us raising our tariffs a trade war if they're still lower than what they bill us? "
5916,Congrats.I bet they were very impress with you.
5917,I bet they will never challenge you again.
5918,"Yes, It feels disgusting and you want to throw your shoe away afterwards. "
5919,"No, never barefoot. I hope you took a long shower. Smelling like dog poo wont get you any ladies."
5920,That would be tough. Have you found a support group to go too?
5921,That would be difficult! I can't imagine the pain you must be going through. Sounds like ya'll have good memories together.
5922,That sounds like a great gandma! You are so blessed to have those memories with her!
5923,"My mom thinks that her grandma's spirit is in me, because she died right before I was born."
5924,"I'm sorry, interviews can be rough. Was there a part of the interview day that you found especially difficult?"
5925,"Maybe it went better than you thought! If not, you still gained some experience from the day."
5926,pets are good as they keep company
5927,"oh my god, it's like a most heartbroken moment of me"
5928,because in that moment is a gift and the last end of hope
5929,"I'm not quite sure what you are telling me, but handling work and school is certainly hard"
5930,I suppose. Training the next generation is important
5931,Whats wrong? Did anything happen? Have you reached out to any friends lately?
5932,"Aw man, Im sorry. That sounds rough. I know how you feel. Time usually helps but it's pretty gradual. Hang in there."
5933,"Can we use the ""broken"" to describe our political system? "
5934,"I agree, the political system we have is a mess and I think it will get worse."
5935,Wow congratulations! Is this your first?
5936,Wow I'm sure you'll be a great parent! Best of luck!
5937,"My boyfriend had issues with his foot, he's even had a few hospital stays for it."
5938,His was too. He had an ulcer that got very infected. Lost half his pinky toe.
5939,I feel you.I had the same feeling when I first left my child on day-care 
5940,You are gonna have to let go one day.It's gonna be hard
5941,"I'm sorry to hear that, is there something in particular that's bothering you the most?"
5942,"I agree that tensions are higher than ever! Hopefully our country will get on the right track soon, I'm looking forward to voting in the primaries."
5943,Oh no!  Why are you mad at them?
5944,That stinks!  Try not to be jealous though.  Something else will come your way.
5945,I bet it was.It looks like you had a panic attack.
5946,You probably need to do some kind of therapy to supres these panic attacks.
5947,That is horrible! Have you ever said anything to him about it?
5948,"Maybe you should mention that you just want a ""guy's night"" and he would get the hint? "
5949,That sucks. Well on the bright side at least you had a suit. Hopefully you were just a regular attendee. 
5950,"Yeah, I know how that is. I bet you won't forget it next time after having to endure all that."
5951,Oh no! You should have preordered it online!
5952,What book was it?
5953,Oh no! You must be quite upset about that. I am sorry to hear that.
5954,"Wow, that is very unfortunate. Maybe a camera nearby was able to see them."
5955,That is very upsetting. Everything will be okay though.
5956,"I have not seen a snake in the woods, have you? That sounds frightening!"
5957,Holy smokes!
5958,Oh I hate when that happens. I'm sorry you felt that way. Did you not buy the dress?
5959,That's good though. I'm glad you were able to find something.
5960,oh man.Tha must have been so embarassing.
5961,You could not read the room?? Someone was probably laughing at you.
5962,first way to overcome it is to figure out the reason for the fear
5963,I think you have to go for a check up first before you can conclude. It might be a harmless mole
5964,"Oh wow! That must have been frightening! That sounds like an exciting experience, though."
5965,No kidding! That will be a memory that you will be unlikely to forget!
5966,That is something to be excited about.  How far away are you moving?
5967,Sounds like a nice upgrade.  Do you think you'll miss your old house at all?
5968,It's okay. People are very understanding. Did you underpay? I'm sure it happens all the time! 
5969,We all have those moments! Sometimes you just have to shake it out of your mind and take a deep breath.
5970,"I did. I once won $10,000 from Colgate Toothpaste."
5971,"I do use their toothpaste, but it was just an instant win contest online. It was years ago. Have you ever won a cash prize?"
5972,Wow! That's amazing!
5973,I'm sorry to hear you were feeling that way.
5974,What types of encouragement was your friend saying to you?
5975,That's a cool toy you got for your nephew 
5976,That will help him alot
5977,yeah that's true
5978,That's not so bad. Everyone cheats on their diet from time to time. I would just pick up where you left off.
5979,Well that's all the more reason that you shouldn't worry about it! You deserved to have a day off after that long!
5980,"Oh how exciting, you must be proud!"
5981,"Yeah, my husband got a thank you like that at work recently and it made us so happy too. Congratulations!"
5982,Did you end up taking him?
5983,Is he just naturally unruly or does he have some sort of condition?
5984,"I'm aware of the ""terrible two's""  I've never heard of the threenager but, im not surprised to hear of it"
5985,Oh man! I love Pokemon! The first one I ever played was Pokemon Blue.
5986,Those were the good ol' days. Now they have way too many Pokemon. I miss the original 151.
5987,That's awesome to hear! Your hard work has paid off.
5988,You should buy yourself a nice treat once you get the promotion!
5989,Good luck.I bet you are ready for this exam.
5990,I am sure you are going to be a succesfull professional 
5991,That sucks. Maybe you can find yourself a new hobby that will keep you occupied while he's gone?
5992,That's understandable. I'd probably feel the same way in the same situation.
5993,"Oh that's awful! I invested 6,000 in January and I'm down to $150 now. I sold off a lot to pay bills but if I wait for it to go back up I can maybe recover 1,500. "
5994,"I know, I am confident it will go back so I'm hanging on to this last bit. Good luck!"
5995,So you guys probably don't get along very well?
5996,Does the wife hate you?
5997,"I don't, are you waiting for one?"
5998,"Nice, I hope you get a nice bonus check!"
5999,Oh that sounds like fun if you are an outdoor person. Are you excited?
6000,"Well that is good, how many people are you going with?"
6001,Congrats.I bet you worked hard for tha raised.
6002,You deserve this raise and many more in the future.
6003,"Aw, that's nice! I haven't considered that yet as I'm still quite young"
6004,I hope so one day! It's a goal of mine :)
6005,"Wow, that is scary. Did you guys do anything or just stay away from it?"
6006,"Yes, I'd be very concerned about pets, too.  I'm glad your fiance got it before it caused anyone anymore trouble."
6007,Oh no! What happened? I can't imagine having to go through something that scary. 
6008,Holy moly! I am so glad you are okay. I'm sure that gave you quite a fright. 
6009,I love going to the casino! My favorite game of all time is blackjack. What are you thinking about playing?
6010,It's swell to meet another player of the craft. Do you rake in the big bucks playing hold 'em?
6011,Oh man... that would tick me off.  What did you do?
6012,I probably would not chop his tree down.  You want to have the moral high ground.  But yes I would confront him
6013,Sounds exciting! Are you going anywhere exotic?
6014,Nice! I visited Spain not too long ago. I am positive you will have a blast.
6015,"Oh that's fun! I love to play video games, but it's usually with friends."
6016,Anything from Mario Party to God of War. It's always fun with friends around for commentary lol
6017,What's your orientation?
6018,"I see, there are some jerks out there in this world."
6019,"Oh my, hope u are alright now. It must have been a terrible experience"
6020,Good that you finally took control of the situation
6021,What is the subject?? The test will be oral or in writing.
6022,"If you are prepared, then you will do fine."
6023,Do you think they are messing up the country?
6024,Yeah they feed off of his crazy I think.
6025,That's awesome.  How long have you been together?
6026,Congratulations to both her and you!  I'm sure she'll keep doing well in her new role.
6027,That happens sometimes.  Was it mistaken for something that might have been sitting there forever?
6028,"I'm sure if you explain it to them, and maybe treat them to lunch another day, they'll forgive you, if they haven't already."
6029,"I'm kinda the same way. Although, I feel like if my friends truly care about me, they'll find out and remember my birthday on their own. No need to go blabbing to everyone about it."
6030,"Now why would they go and do that! Well, in any case, what did good ole Ron get for you?"
6031,Yay! That is a difficult feat.
6032,Mine took months to train forever. I was so happy when he finally learned.
6033,"Have you tried taking any aspirin? I feel bad for you, my friend."
6034,"Yeah, sometimes you have to do that to get better. I would take another dose if I were you."
6035,Do you have any plans for it? That sounds exciting!
6036,"I would kill for two weeks of R&R, good for you!"
6037,That's wonderful. There's nothing like a bit of retail therapy to cheer you up. Now you
6038,Sure does. I hope you continue to enjoy your new dress - you make me want to go and buy one now!
6039,"Oh, I will and I know just where I'll wear it - there's a new restaurant just opened I want to try out."
6040,Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. Is she feeling any better?
6041,"That must have been unpleasant for her. I am glad to hear that she is feeling better,"
6042,I know the anciptation of giving big presentations.  Are you nervous?
6043,"I would tell you to think of everyone in their underwear, but I am pretty sure that advice never works!"
6044,"Holy moly, that's some rough luck. Did you find the guy who did it?"
6045,Dang dude. Is your insurance company covering it at least?
6046,I am so glad to hear that. What is the secret?
6047,How did you meet her? Was it through an online dating service?
6048,Get to studying! I'm sure if you get in a few mores hours you will feel more confident! 
6049,Hard work always pays off!
6050,"I have been there, my friend. But, the good news is, if you aren't typically late for your bills, the utilities companies will often cut you a break."
6051,"I am positive! I have been late before for the very same reason. Don't even need to make phone calls - they just give you a small late fee and that's it. I wouldn't go making it a habit, though."
6052,How did that happen? I would be so upset.
6053,Did Starbucks not make you a new one? I am definitely grumpy if I don't get my morning coffee! 
6054,Oh well it's still fun that you got to participate in that.
6055,Haha that's really a cute story though.
6056,"Oh wow, did anything end up happening to you? Did you get 20 years in prison?"
6057,"Eh, I suppose worse things could happen. Was it worth it?"
6058,Great! what kind of business?
6059,Music therapy sounds very interesting.
6060,That is great. Do you remember what words he had to spell?
6061,That is a pretty tough word. I am happy your son did so great. You must have been beaming.
6062,"That's a downer, man. Who do you think was the perpetrator?"
6063,That really sucks man. Did he ever apologize to you and give the money back?
6064,Oh no! Did he not study?
6065,He will for sure get it next time. I'm sure you scared him enough haha
6066,I love flying!  Was it your first time on an airplane?
6067,"I prefer night flying as well.  I love how you can see the city lights moving, like it's the lifeblood of a living thing."
6068,Sometimes destiny has strange ways of manifesting itself.
6069,"Try to conquer your wife again, it's never too late for a second chance, the love of our lives makes it worth the effort."
6070,I do as well! What do you miss most?
6071,There's really nothing like college parties. Those were the days.
6072,You should confiscate his video game and teach him a lesson.
6073,You are doing the right thing for him to learn discipline.
6074,Oh no! Any particular reason why?
6075,"That's horrible! But, it could be many other things instead. I hope you go to the doctor"
6076,How did it go.Did you have fun?
6077,Why is that? You don't now how to dance?
6078,Oh no. How did you pay?
6079,That is good. Hopefully he can pay you back.
6080,"Oh no, that must've been awful! "
6081,"Woah, that sounds like a very unpleasant experience. I hope it's never gonna happen to you again."
6082,That's a bummer. What happened once you moved there?
6083,It's good to hear that your experience was fulfilling. I hope I can have a similar once someday.
6084,That would be tough! Have you tried switching to cash envelopes?
6085,"Where you just use cash and put money in an envelope, when it's gone, it's gone, nothing left to spend."
6086,and what happened? 
6087,"Yeah, I always get a little anxious when you get pulled in for those meetings.    Is it going to be champagne or chewing"
6088,it sucks when you can't depend on co-workers
6089,well i hope some better people get hired
6090,"Oh wow, I have done that before as well. You may have to deal with some indigestion."
6091,"Oh boy, you have need to invest in some Depends."
6092,"Oh no, you must have been quite upset. What did you do?"
6093,That's great. I was worried that you had to go hungry.
6094,Maybe it was a thunderstorm forming??
6095,It souds like a storm forming.I have experience with thunderstorms.
6096,Really? What did your boss do that made you so mad?
6097,Oh that is a real bummer. Your boss should appreciate you for giving good ideas.
6098,That is great news!  What does he play?
6099,Is there a big baseball following in Alaska?
6100,"Those were the days, my friend. What kind of car did you have?"
6101,"Ford makes some pretty nifty cars! I have a Ford Focus myself. Not much, but it has killer gas mileage."
6102,"OMG, i don't think i could eat that many burgers in a week if I tried. What was bothering you so much that it lead to you eating so many burgers?"
6103,"Im sorry you felt that way, I hope you start feeling better. Maybe go for a walk and get some fresh air."
6104,"That's sad, I wonder why the dog can't find a home!"
6105,Maybe the poor dog doesn't get along with other dogs.
6106,"Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. That must be so hard. How have you been coping?"
6107,"Oh wow, that is so sad. Have you contacted an attorney?"
6108,What haha that's a real thing???
6109,Wow that's cool well good job winning!
6110,"Oh geez, that sounds pretty embarrassing. Did any of the bottles break?"
6111,"That's a shame. If they did, you could've reversed the situation and summoned everybody over to throw down and have a supremo wine fest."
6112,You should feel bad for just cursing at a lady.
6113,Did you at least apologized?
6114,That must be a great feeling!  Good for you!  You should be proud that things are going well and not take it for granted.
6115,Good deal!  I am happy to help!
6116,"Yes, I am as well. Do you have any investments that could be affected?"
6117,"I understand that, but do you have a personal investment portfolio that will be directly affected?"
6118,"Oh wow, do they taste good?"
6119,Are they expensive or did you just find them in the wild?
6120,"Sure, go ahead. Is it an important one?"
6121,"That's great. Have yo sent it yet? Congratulations, by the way. Wish you good luck !"
6122,OK sure. Go ahead
6123,Oh wow! that sounds like fun. What was your favorite part of the visit?
6124,"I love Thai food, what a treat! I am glad that you had such a wonderful time."
6125,"Aww, did you find a lot?"
6126,I love finding old videos too!
6127,Yeah it sure is. Especially when you are streaming or talking to someone in the moment.
6128,Completely frustrating. I usually end up calling customer service and complaining until it's fixed if it happens repeatedly. 
6129,did your daughter's team win?
6130,"Lol, that must have been a very proud moment for you as a parent"
6131,Oh no that is terrible. Are you guys still talking now?
6132,Well that is not good. What did she do that was so bad?
6133,"I would be scared too, but I'm happy it turned out well."
6134,That is the best feeling.
6135,"Oh no, that is too bad. I am sorry for your unneeded expenditures."
6136,That is a good attitude to have. I am proud of your maturity.
6137,"Yeah, kids get crazy when they are bored.  Get them to read a book!"
6138,You might need to lay down the law and ground them!
6139,How kind of him! I bet that is going to help you out a lot!
6140,"Dads are the best, what would we do without them?"
6141,Wow how amazing! You must be so excited. 
6142,"Wow enjoy it, you deserve it!"
6143,"Omg, you should have killed it"
6144,I think you should fumigate your home
6145,Have you been able to get over your fear?
6146,That is good to hear. You might consider joining some groups. Toastmasters might be a good one to look into.
6147,Was your aunt nice to you?
6148,Sometimes it is difficult to talk to relatives. Take a deep breath and treat her like a long time friend.  
6149,"Oh no, I hate when that happens.  People always feel a need to look and it causes the other lanes to be at a standstill as well.  How long did you have to wait?"
6150,"Adding time to your commute from work to home is the worst.  I mean you've put in a full day, you just want to get home!"
6151,"So, the pup is healthy and  situated now?"
6152,I'm sorry to hear that RIP doggo.   I have a rescue that's middle aged now. 
6153,How exciting! Has it been a long time since you've seen her?
6154,I'm jealous! That's so sweet and I hope you have a great time!
6155,Oh no! What did you do?
6156,how about a hobble down the isle? I'm sure it will still be just as beautiful walking down the isle or not. 
6157,"That would be difficult, so glad you survived."
6158,Hopefully you have a strong family support.
6159,maybe it was best to avoid drama at work
6160,not getting your coworker in trouble and causing a conflict
6161,Has your boyfriend ever cheated on you?
6162,I agree. Trust is the basis for any good relationship.
6163,How did that go?
6164,The cigarette break is not a good sign at all.
6165,"This is so good, well done"
6166,How long have you been on this?
6167,I think there are a lot more choices now than there was years ago
6168,I still remember the old tube tvs
6169,That is nice. Where are you going?
6170,That is a good idea.
6171,I am sure he will!
6172,"No, no reason to he will do it."
6173,That's awesome.  Good parenting pays off.
6174,always a plus.  That makes things easier
6175,"Nice, how excited are you for it?"
6176,"I'd be that excited too, I love to fish."
6177,"You are a hard working person, you will be fine"
6178,"Like they say, hard-work never killed anyone"
6179,"Oh my god that's crazy, I'm sorry to hear that."
6180,I hope nothing like that ever happens again.
6181,What type of review are you looking for?
6182,Oh that would be nerve wracking! Good Luck!
6183,"I'm sorry to hear that, I've felt similar before."
6184,Did they every tell you why they left without you?
6185,I'm so sorry to hear that. I lost my cat recently too. 
6186,That's a great name. :) My cat's name was Midnight. I had him it seemed forever. How long did you have yours
6187,oh wow really? You shouldn't be! You should be excited
6188,did they go okay? Are you anxious about tomorrow then?
6189,"I'm sorry to hear that. I've lost both of mine, I know how you feel."
6190,The downward spiral is neveer pleasent to see.
6191,Oh wow! I never got a car for mine! Did you take good care of it?
6192,"Oh no! A lot of kids that age seem to do that with cars they get, yet parents keep buying them new."
6193,"Oh no, why is that?"
6194,What instruments do your daughters play?
6195,"Hi friend, how are you?"
6196,"Not yet, I think you should talk to me about it."
6197,"To feel joy is the maximum, whatever the cause, I think it is a beautiful emotion."
6198,"Feel joy and feel peace, are the best combination of emotions to be happy in life."
6199,Good for you. what makes you so happy?
6200,Good point. Any example to share?
6201,"Oh wow, I am so sorry to hear that. May I ask what happened?"
6202,"Oh, well I'm sure she was worried, but disowning you doesn't help! And now she won't know your child. That's very sad. "
6203,I'm sure it was hard but worth it!
6204,That's great I hope you get it!
6205,I bet that was an awkward conversation. Did you feel embarassed?
6206,"Well that is good she prepared you, most parents just avoid the topic."
6207,"I've heard it's quite dangerous, are you scared?"
6208,"I bet it's going to be hard to fit in culturally, are you religious?"
6209,Yea somethings are just worth trying to see how they'd go. You made it through welldone
6210,Yes teachers do alot and they deserve credit
6211,"Wow that's so fun, you're lucky to have many people who care about you."
6212,I hope you had fun.
6213,That is so thoughtful!
6214,I can only imagine with the stress of a new baby.
6215,What kind of jacket did they steal from you?
6216,"Sorry to hear that, did you eventually get it back or no?"
6217,you shouldn't' have been playing in the kitchen
6218,You should
6219,That's great. It's been a hot summer. I hope you have fun.
6220,Everybody likes beach trips.
6221,Finding things to be grateful for have saved my sanity
6222,What is your favorite part about each day?
6223,Oh I don't know. Probably happy hour.
6224,that is her maternal instinct
6225,no i dont think it is
6226,Oh no that is terrible. What did you take?
6227,"Oh boy, were you just trying to borrow it? I bet he was real disappointed."
6228,Wow the zoo sounds like an amazing time. Lol the diaper thing happens.
6229,Whew good thing for those back up diapers. Glad you guys had fun.
6230,"Wow, that sounds amazing. I would have died and gone to heaven if I had gotten one."
6231,"I cried, jumped, and screamed... when I got my first student loan bill! Congrats on the good work though!"
6232,what subject is it in?
6233,i hope you perform well on your exam
6234,"Well, he could bring something home. Don't feel bad."
6235,Don't feel too guilty. You can have that for dinner tomorrow night. Get pizza tonight.
6236,"Oh my gosh, how horrible! I hope she will be okay."
6237,"You are a nice friend, she's lucky to have you."
6238,Dang. That is annoying
6239,You must have informed them abou this
6240,I bet that was really cool! Did you play with them for a little? You're never to old to play with toys
6241,Thats awesome! Old toys are the best toys
6242,That's great. How long have you been apart for?
6243,Do you have some fun activities planned?
6244,oh wow! I've always wanted to do that. You're quite brave
6245,"It's good to have someone with you who knows what they're doing, though. That certainly helps!"
6246,That is awesome! Why were you nervous?
6247,I am so happy everything went well for you.
6248,Wow.  That is a sight to wake up to.  What did you do?
6249,I can imagine.  I would be burning that sheet set
6250,Oh my god! Did it try to bite you?
6251,That must have been a shock. I hope you took it outside after that.
6252,What kind of task was it?
6253,and well how did it go after all your research?
6254,Fantastic.  Congratulations!
6255,I bet you're so happy! I would be! 
6256,who doesn't :) what are you planning to do?
6257,Omg I am so sorry to hear that. :( Are you feeling at peace at all now? 
6258,That is a long time so I am sure its been very hard. Im really sorry but I hope soon you can find peace. 
6259,That's terrible and frustrating because you can't really do anything about it.
6260,"HAHA, best to find another job first. At least employment is looking pretty good these days."
6261,"Oh man, that sounds awful. I thought the 7 hour drives we did with 3 of us were awful."
6262,"That's rough. I feel for you! But, as you said it's over so life goes on :}"
6263,That's pretty amazing. I have tried juggling 3 small objects before and felt like it was impossible. 
6264,"I can understand that. After my failed attempt, my oldest son, then 13, came in the room juggling successfully a few minutes later. He watched a youtube video and learned in about 15 minutes..."
6265,I'm sorry to hear that.  What do they get treatment for?
6266,"I'm sure that's really tough.  I hope he appreciates all that you're doing for him, and I'm sure it'll work out :)"
6267,"That's nice, must have saved you a lot of time."
6268,"It's election day here, that may be the cause of it."
6269,I wish I got that many days off.  The good old days of childhood.
6270,"Wait until summer comes, you'll be ready for them to go back to school after a month."
6271,"oh i love perfume, whats it smell like? "
6272,Oh for sure and its honestly insane to spend too much on a perfume! Call me cheap lol 
6273,"Great attitude! Yes whatever you put your mind too and work hard at, will happen!"
6274,You're so welcome! Good luck and I hope it's a great place with a good paycheck!
6275,It's always good to see family! What concert was it?
6276,Oh cool! What kind of music does he play?
6277,I am so happy for you and the dog
6278,I am sure she will be okay
6279,Have you asked the teacher for any sort of help?
6280,I think you should try to find different ways to go about the problem. I'm not great at math either but I think you could find some online forums willing to help you.
6281,Are spending too much on unnecessary things?
6282,Do you have any concrete financial plan on full repayment of your debts?
6283,Congrats to your father! At what age did he get to finally relax!?
6284,Good for him! He sounds like an awesome guy. 
6285,That is nice. Are you excited
6286,It should be a easy process
6287,Oh great! Is it a college and what are you studying?
6288,Oh man! I bet you are! Just remember to be confident in yourself and you'll do fine! Don't let trolls to you either
6289,Oh I know how that feels. You can start over tomorrow though.
6290,I hate those cravings. I need to start doing better too.
6291,That's awesome! I love swimming. Are you going to the pool or the beach?
6292,I love going to the pool. I hope you have a great time!
6293,OH no. I really dislike theives.
6294,Do you have insurance?
6295,You should think about that for all of your stuff got situations like this.
6296,Leaving you? why?
6297,OK now I understand
6298,we are too hard on ourselves! we really shouldnt care what others think but i would have felt the same 
6299,im the same! give people a look when they look at you maybe some crazy eyes! lol 
6300,Oh geez! That would suck! I hope it wasn't a cold day? Could you drive home and get new clothes?
6301,Oh I have numbness in my hands so I am always spilling things so don't feel too bad! I understand though. As you can see- I don't like having stuff on my clothes either lol
6302,Wow! How old is he?
6303,"Amazing! Congratulations. When so many children have issues, it is always great to see one that is healthy and well."
6304,"That sounds awful. Mine used to have a bad group of friends too at one point so I know how it feels. Sometimes you just want to yell ""grow up!!!"""
6305,"Yes!!! I cannot even express to you how much I agree!! My mom used to say ""you are who you hang out with"" and its one of the most true things I have ever been told by anyone!! "
6306,That's awful. It sounds like a freak accident. What happend?
6307,"Wow, I am sorry to hear. I had a friend with an aneurysm pass suddenly about 2 years ago. It was hard and I can't imagine how you feel with it being your father. "
6308,Why were you nervous
6309,I do love a good sour
6310,I can imagine she and the school appreciate that
6311,That was a very nice gesture
6312,We all get nervous about changing our surroundings
6313,I have seen them
6314,I am not sure I believe them most of the time though
6315,Wow. That's pretty cool.
6316,I would have been too. No one has ever bought me a car.
6317,"I am sorry, how old was it"
6318,That is a lot of memories
6319,What was your excuse?
6320,"Wow, that is pretty bad.  At least it was a cousin and not a sibling."
6321,"Sounds like he's getting the hang of it, that's good."
6322,"Maybe I should of did the same for mines, to late now."
6323,"Thank you, I'll do that."
6324,yes I do. Do you?
6325,Is that a good or a bad thing?
6326,Sticky paper is so gross. have you every used cloves? You can put the in your windows to keep flies out.
6327,I don'r know. Once I found out about cloves that worked fr me. Maybe you should het an exterminator although that seems extreme.
6328,Probablt. Im sorry I couldnt help you. 
6329,"Okay, How come?"
6330,That sounds great! I should look in too them more.
6331,Thats pretty awesome! College or highschool testt?
6332,Nice! Science is fun but for some reason the tests can be very hard!
6333,I am sure no one noticed
6334,I do get that way too sometimes
6335,So you did get it?
6336,Well good for you. Is it everything you wanted> I once had a job turn out to be the worst.
6337,I do not yet
6338,I bet that was scary at the time
6339,New people make me so nervous.
6340,I have never tried one of those. Did it help?
6341,Well that's pretty cool. You should own the joint by now.
6342,Oh yeah? I bet that was exciting for both of you. Open house at their school?
6343,"I had an experience similar to that as well. Their teachers look like they should still be in High School. But, they are so eager to do well I get excited with my kids for the school year."
6344,"Definatly. I would not want to do that job, with such alful pay unless I loved the work. Wouldn't be fair to anyone involved."
6345,I love going to the thrift stores as well! What did you by
6346,tell me about it!! I bought so many brand new shirts in a thrift store last year and they still look awesome because the quality was so great
6347,having a few good friends or even one is better then having a bunch of fake ones. It is hard to make friends as an adult that are true friends even if you are great at it! So don't feel bad
6348,I understand! I used to be the social butterfly but now after a lot of trauma I am very anxious as well and I don't care to have people I don't trust around me anyhow. Maybe try meetups or forums where people have the same interests?
6349,What does he do that scares you?
6350,"He may just be on a different time schedule than you. My neighbor does something similar, he mows his lawn at 3am"
6351,That's kind of odd. Is he old?
6352,Wow. That must be nice.
6353,Good for you! I have never gotten a promotion before.
6354,"Most of them are like that, or they are fixated by what everything costs."
6355,"Yes, but isn't innocence a beautiful thing."
6356,Me too. I hope you have nice memories.
6357,Well thats good. Some people aren't so lucky
6358,"that's not good :( i hope you don't drive under influence anymore, you could've gotten into an accident"
6359,"Oh, that sound alful! Some people have zero respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share."
6360,It is sad. Espically since if the same people acted like they cared and wanted to they could help make the enviroment better for everyone. 
6361,"Oh! I LOVE the sound of rain, I could just sit in the warm rain too! "
6362,It does just bring about a great feeling doesn't it?
6363,"Oh thank goodness! If I may ask, what was he in the hospital for?"
6364,Was it anything serious? So many things can go wrong with out bodies!
6365,I hate when people do that
6366,"I am not sure, that is a good question"
6367,What did they want?
6368,"Well, it was fortunate that you got it back ok."
6369,Did something bad happen?
6370,That is true. It is sad.
6371,"I've heard of that, is it any good?"
6372,I've found a lot of BBC shows are really good because they don't try to drag them out really far.
6373,"Wow that is crazy, sometimes not so uncommon depending on your area, sadly! "
6374,"Yes it is very disgusting, I just don't understand why it takes some people so long to get their act together!"
6375,Death can happen in an INSTANT! I have been there the past year. I am sorry!
6376,Me too! So sorry! Life doesn't get any easier. It's just about trying to enjoy every day
6377,Its always worth a shot
6378,My mom was bipolar
6379,Well that happens sometimes.
6380,"I do hate storms, they can be scary"
6381,I am glad you are okay though
6382,That is exciting! So it will be the first real year of school for you and them? 
6383,"I forgot all about prek, you can see mine arent old enough yet. lol Well I am happy for you thats very exciting. "
6384,"Oh, that is exciting. What did you do with them?"
6385,That's a great idea. Such a good way to preserve a memory.
6386,Wow thats amazing! How old are they and what do they play?
6387,Oh! Two of the most beautiful instruments! Congrats! Does musical ability run in your family?
6388,Awesome! What do you hope for their future?
6389,What do you think that you'll have ?
6390,I'm glad you seem to have it all figured out.
6391,Oh geez. That is common with kids. Not the funnest times. Do you carry extra clothes too?
6392,Oh yes! Always carry an extra onesie and pants. That has saved me many times!
6393,How old is your gramma ? old people can get grumpy
6394,i hope it all works out for your mom 
6395,What happened to it
6396,That doesnt sound so hard to fix
6397,What was his excuse?
6398,Ouch that's pretty bad.  Did he apologize?
6399,"That's very vague, did you like the shows? Or the program itself?"
6400,That's so cool! I liked the shows on that channel as well.
6401,Doesn't that cost a lot?
6402,They do always have snacks.
6403,Oh! Do you feel scared at all and will miss her?
6404,Do they have cameras there so you can watch her during the day?
6405,I will look into that thank you so much thats kind of you! Any special diet or fitness online you are following? I know you can do this. 
6406,I recently read about fasting myself! I tried it for a whole few days and of course stopped. I wish I had your determination! I wish you a lot of luck. :) 
6407,I have a few friends doing keto and you seem to really like it so I am going to give it a go! Ill try your advice. thank you! 
6408,Aw poor kitty! Well that is their fault for sure. Have you spoke to them about it? Also you can get these spray things that keep cast out of your yard- They spray them with water when they cross a barrier-
6409,Oh man! Well some owners suck! I would definitely look in to the water sprayers. Is the cat fixed? 
6410,You should make it a weekend project
6411,you will get it done i believe in you
6412,That is so beautiful! Are you going to do it every year now and make it tradition? 
6413,Right! Thats what I am thinking too... so cool when communities come together like that. 
6414,"Wow, haven't people heard of knocking once and waiting? That sounds worrisome."
6415,Was he a salesman?
6416,so you got a lemon ? check your state laws
6417,Things like this happen all the time
6418,Oh man! I so understand that! Did you have to eat ramen and $1 meals? I did! It was awful! I am so glad you are in a better place now
6419,"Oh yes, I have been there to! Some food pantries are amazing but some have just crappy sugary foods. "
6420,What did he do? 
6421,"Oh neighborhood, lol I thought it said neighbor for a second! Why wasnt it safe? "
6422,Typos happen to the best of us right! Im glad the summer was atleast nice for them and that the bad people left! 
6423,I'll be the judge of that
6424,That's nothing. As long as you still get her a phone. I wouldnt be mad
6425,Well give her the new phone and then you get one later. Happy wife happy life
6426,Oh I hear you! It'
6427,Sorry! It's so nice when you can afford nice stuff! I feel you there. I do not have a TV- I watch everything on the computer lol! As I am on it all the time
6428,how long was it out for
6429,i hear you 
6430,That's very kind of you.  Did she feel better after?
6431,That's good to hear.  Do parents often view the daycare cameras?
6432,Oh man! I am so sorry! You must be devastated.
6433,Oh man..I just had someone go through that. It is horrifying. Yes a long battle can be good or bad. I am sorry.
6434,I bet that was a nice surprise
6435,That is always a nice surprise
6436,What does the teacher say happened?
6437,"Oh, that's rough. "
6438,Sometimes depending on who they are.
6439,That's so nice. Im happy for you.
6440,Are you gonna see each other again soon?
6441,a hurricane ?
6442,we have a hurricane kit / emergency essential kit always . 
6443,they are good to have . always to be prepared .
6444,a good phone is something everyone must have 
6445,you're the first person i know that has an xperia
6446,I feel the same! I hate apple products. I refuse to use them
6447,I didn't know that. Another reason to not like them
6448,I am sure you will do great. What kind of biology is it?
6449,You just need to know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse.
6450,Yeah I could never do bio it was too much memorization. I like physics more which is why I'm in engineering.
6451,what type of math is it?
6452,Oh my god! That is so sad! I am so sorry!
6453,That is a good way of looking at things.
6454,Some people are just so careless... I am sure your mom was keeping a good eye on the child. shame on the parent tho. 
6455,I know its a pain in the rear to lug them around but you have to. I lug mine around like a kangaroo with her kid in her pouch. 
6456,That's the worst.. expectations can make and break us. I hope the next time around you get it! 
6457,that is a good outlook to have
6458,That is a great. I hope it was a good offer
6459,Oh that sounds convenient
6460,That is so true. 
6461,I am thankful for every day I get to spend with my children. 
6462,That makes me sad too. I wish there was more I could do to help out.
6463,That's a good idea!
6464,It feels good when your on top of things.
6465,"Well, I'm sure they will benefit greatly from all the preparation. They should be proud to have a mom who cares as much as you."
6466,Oh thats wonderful! how long have your parents been together?
6467,"Oh geez, lol. Do you not like to cook? Congratulate your parents for me. It's great to find someone you love and then also to have it last so long!"
6468,I've seen that before. It is sad.
6469,I do too. Everyone deserves to have someone in their corner.
6470,Oh that's a bummer! Do you go to college locally?
6471,Oh great! I am not a big fan of college anyway. Maybe you will find a new love while they are away :)
6472,I don't think anything is worse than dealing with a period as a teenager!
6473,I miss being so carefree and having the whole world at my fingertips!
6474,Awesome! History is HARD! I always had a hard time remembering the dates and times especially.
6475,Amazing! What was your final grade?
6476,Its nice that you care so much about them
6477,They are that
6478,That's unfortunate. How many animals did you have?
6479,What kind of animals were they?
6480,ugh.. for the better or worst? How are you feeling? 
6481,If you are feeling that way then it probably is! On to a fresh start. 
6482,Me either. It is going to be interesting.
6483,Two daughters and one son
6484,Hope you've got a lot of storage room. We try to do that too.
6485,how old are they ?
6486,"Wow, mothers have the best instincts when it comes to their children."
6487,"Exactly, take care of her. She is a treasure."
6488,You're very lucky! A lot of people can't say that these days.
6489,I wish I could do that.
6490,That is so sad!  I would be so mad at the drunk driver!  How could he live with himself!
6491,I agree!  There is no excuse for that to have happened!  Such a tragedy!
6492,Why did they do that?
6493,Oh shoot. Did you forget to pay?
6494,I am sure that was embarrassing. Just a mistake. 
6495,That's pretty cool. Did they win any games in the tournament?
6496,Well that's amazing!
6497,Who did they win it over?
6498,Did you pass?
6499,"That is great, good job."
6500,That is disappointing. What will you do now?
6501,I don't blame you.
6502,THat is great.  SHe will have fun participating in spelling bees
6503,That is outstanding!
6504,what scared you
6505,oh man how did you get it out
6506,That's wonderful. I feel the same about my daughters.
6507,"10 and 13 now, but it never changes."
6508,That sucks. I hope you had insurance.
6509,"Well he was the one that caused it, so that's what he gets."
6510,"I'm sorry, you must miss them a lot if you don't see them as much as you used to."
6511,He is a jerk.
6512,Don't forgive him or your friend. Find new people 
6513,Why have you wanted every career instead of focusing on just one?
6514,I think you could still find one if you wanted too.
6515,That sucks.  Have you investigated her
6516,"Sucks, I've had to work under scumbag managment before"
6517,Thats awesome! What have you been doing to reach it? 
6518,ugh sounds like work...... but you did it! 
6519,I'm 50 and haven't rode one since I was 2.
6520,Don't have anywhere I need to go.
6521,I can relate to that. 
6522,That will be nice.  Having a side gig really helps a lot as long as it doesnt take too much time
6523,Nice!  What was it for?
6524,Awesome!  What do you do at your job?
6525,I'm sure you will be vindicated.
6526,"whoops, lots of people have done that. what'd she say?"
6527,hopefully you were able to work it out...if not...in the future don't tell girlfriends about exes.
6528,And did you?
6529,Great job!
6530,That does sound awful!  The thought of being out in the middle of the ocean makes me nervous 
6531,I agree.  Don't let it stop  from taking a nice getaway though
6532,That sounds really annoying!  You should confront him and request he stop.
6533,That would make me really angry.  Call a tow truck to teach him a lesson.
6534,Why didnt you want to notify or leave some sort of little note on the car? 
6535,happens sometimes just dont know what to do in those moments. 
6536,That seems like it'd be strange.
6537,"well, you could always have left."
6538,Do they play any instruments?
6539,"That's cool, can they sing too?"
6540,"I hate when that happens, did you have to put all your stuff back?"
6541,"Well it happens to everyone at least once probably, so no worries."
6542,"happens all the time in the city i live in, people are rude! "
6543,yup! no reason to stoop to their level. you did right 
6544,I hope you didn't use any.
6545,Was the soup good at least?
6546,What did you say?
6547,What did you do instead?
6548,That would freak me out.  What was it form?
6549,Oh Wow!  Did he get caught?
6550,What were you on edge about?
6551,What movie did she see?
6552,Sorry to hear that. What's wrong?
6553,"I know that feeling, it will get better. Just gotta stay positive"
6554,"Ha, that sounds comical."
6555,You could just think that maybe you were alone.
6556,That was pretty crappy. What did you do instead.
6557,that's really crappy.    You're racking up the bad karma.
6558,That's got to be frustrating for you.
6559,Have you tried asking for a raise yourself?
6560,I have felt that way sometimes too
6561,I am trying to teach that to my children. They are stubborn
6562,What are you going to do about it? 
6563,Get some hot shots raid spray it shoots like 20 to 30 feet in the air! I sprayed all the way from the ground to the top of my roof. Spray and run. lol! 
6564,It is great to appreciate the things that we often take for granted
6565,That is true. It makes some of our trivial problems seem so insignificant
6566,That's never good. What was it?
6567,At least it wasn't a stranger trying to break in!
6568,Oh jeez!! Noooo... I hate them. They are evil and so mean. They literally come right at you for no reason. 
6569,I cant handle any type of insect. I had a giant black one fly into my apartment today when I opened the door so I feel you. 
6570,"Haha, is she going with you?"
6571,Definitely take her with you! She will love it as much as you
6572,What was the award?
6573,"Dang, that sucks. Did you get 2nd place?"
6574,I like to tan in the sun.
6575,"Yes, I always use sun screen."
6576,"No idea, what was it?"
6577,I love having a clean home and warm food! No better feeling. Did your husband do this for u?
6578,Never heard of it but you better believe i will be googling. 
6579,deff jumping on the internet now to read into it i do like spiderman! 
6580,"Oh no, what did you do ?"
6581,how long did you have to stay that way.
6582,What prompted that?
6583,I can understand that.  Reflecting on different times
6584,Me too. We just need to keep at it and not give up.
6585,"I'm not even looking for anything serious like marriage, just a friend that I can relate to romantically."
6586,I used to have the DVD but I sold all of the to upgrade to Bluray. I havent seen that in forever
6587,The ;ast spiderman movie was really good. Did you see it?
6588,What's going on on Friday? 
6589,Oh awesome! I love taking vacations. Where are you going? 
6590,What! You still got your discount tho right? So you get to use them over again!? 
6591,thats righty! you better go buy a lotto ticket because you are deff lucky 
6592,"That sucks, I love my mom so much I can't imagine her being dead..."
6593,"I will def do that, I need to be more grateful for while she is alive. Thank you for that"
6594,That's what family is for!
6595,Why do you hate your parents?
6596,"great, I hope it works out for you."
6597,what's your preferred field?
6598,"Yes, kids are a blessing."
6599,Enjoy it because they grow up so fast.
6600,That is so cool!  How old is your dog?
6601,That is exciting!
6602,"Wow, she is talented. Is programming difficult/?"
6603,"Oh, I thought you meant like computer programming. You must be so proud"
6604,"Driving in the city is challenging, I hope she does ok!"
6605,"There's also a lot of one ways in the city too. She's going to get used to it, it should be fine"
6606,I hear it is harder the second time around to get into shape but you sound motivated! 
6607,Really? Thats good to know because I had no idea. I wish you a lot of luck in regaining your muscles back! 
6608,I know that feeling but I crashed my car my dad bought for me like 1 year later. But that feeling of happiness was awesome!
6609,A bad and good experience haha. Drive safely unlike me
6610,Sounds like an amazing day honestly... i hope tomorrow goes the same for you. 
6611,Oh yeah and I hate to admit it but if it doesnt go as planned I do let it ruin my day. 
6612,What did you get started doing?
6613,Oh no!  I would be too
6614,how old is he?
6615,I hope he was okay.
6616,You have to do what you have to do. Did anyone walk out and see you? lol 
6617,atleast they didnt see you! 
6618,wow i am impressed
6619,what are your long term goals /
6620,It's always a pain waiting to hear back from a bank.  I always think something's gonna go wrong.
6621,I'm sure everything will work out fine :)
6622,Is that to become a bartender?
6623,Are you nervous?
6624,Was it good?
6625,Did you return the movie?
6626,"Wow, they don't sound like good friends to me. "
6627,You should give them the cold shoulder next time you see them. That's what I would do.
6628,Nice! I bet you feel like a weight was lifted off your shoulders!
6629,What is your side gig if you don't mind me asking?
6630,There is a lot of buzz for that is there?
6631,THat sounds cool.  What format do you play that on?
6632,I don't watch a lot of baseball but was it an important game?
6633,"Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe they will reschedule it for a later date?"
6634,I do not have a car either.
6635,I will never buy a car again.
6636,"i know that feeling, congraz"
6637,your first home ?
6638,"Sounds like it was worth the ticket, what kind of caR? "
6639,deff worth it! 
6640,"I bet you're relieved!  Good friends are like that though, especially if they know you're struggling. "
6641,"Maybe when you pay him back, you can get him a little something extra to show your appreciation."
6642,"Oh no haha, were you prepared for it?"
6643,"Nice, good job!"
6644,Waiting always kills me! How much longer do you have to wait? 
6645,I am sending you good vibes and luck! 
6646,What happened?!?
6647,"Oh no, that's never good. Is he doing fine now/"
6648,its a part of life you know
6649,i remeber that day
6650,that is outstanding!
6651,Right.  Hopefully that will motivate her to keep up the good work!
6652,Just tell her? She will be grateful for the honesty.
6653,"Dang, that's rough. I wouldn't know what to do either. It's like you choose to be a good friend and destroy their marriage or let her get married so she's happy. Goodl uck"
6654,Did you jump out or did you brave the war and kill it!?
6655,Im sure!!! I had a gecko come in my house today and it was adorable yet i was still super scared to touch it. 
6656,I feel the same way. I have social anxiety so standing in front of a crowd is pretty terrifying. 
6657,Oh man! Just stay confident! You have to keep the negative thoughts in the back of your mind.
6658,"Yikes, I hope you have insurance."
6659,"Don't worry man, you'll be fine. Everyone makes mistakes"
6660,Thats good everything is so close. It really helps out a lot and walking is good for you! 
6661,You and I both! 
6662,Resist the temptation!
6663,Food is the worst too because all that junk food is all around us.
6664,I love those moments where you get to see all the hard work get payed off! How did she do?
6665,I bet you are so proud of her!
6666,Oh no!  I bet you regretted that fast!
6667,That sounds bad. It was probably harder to get off too
6668,How long are we talking about ?
6669,Sounds like you know what to do.
6670,It should be getting better now that summer is over. Good luck
6671,It's hard to admit when we are wrong. DO you think you will fess up?
6672,I understand that
6673,I believe in you! Where are you planning on going?
6674,I was thinking a cruise sounds perfect for you and your kids!
6675,Have you called her back since then?
6676,"I'm sorry, sometimes people, even family can be difficult. you can't be all things to all people. give yourself a break on this."
6677,You guys sound like a strong family!
6678,"Sorry to hear that, maybe one day you entire family can get along"
6679,I feel the same way.  I don't trust people are paying attention
6680,That is my biggest fear too
6681,I hope it was a mistake?
6682,That was crazy!  I agree
6683,Soccer is a fun sport to play. It would be good for you to do something you love also
6684,Was it their fault?
6685,"Been there, done that lol."
6686,What type of dog is she?
6687,Haven't heard of that one before.
6688,"Whoa, that sucks. You need to get away from them asap."
6689,I've only been to a couple of minor leagure games in the city.
6690,That's pretty cool.
6691,I have never had any. Is it similar to eating crawfish?
6692,Sometimes you just have to indulge and then do better next time.
6693,I am with you right now! However tracking carbs accurately in an app has been a gamechanger this week
6694,You will be so shocked at how well it works I promise.  You don't want to go over. 
6695,That's awesome! How old is your cousins?
6696,I hope you guys have a lot of fun! I think I'm going to meet my cousin in New Jersey on the 9th? It's so nice seeing famiy members after a long time.
6697,Oh no. Did you get it back?
6698,That's such a shame. It really makes you lose your trust in people.
6699,It's such a terrible situation. You just never know what circumstances have brought someone to where they are.
6700,I know what you mean. 
6701,"That suck's, have you tried calling the bank to let them know about the mistake?"
6702,Did you get your money back?
6703,What do you do in the summer?
6704,I love going to concerts.
6705,Who isn't? I am scared of death because I don't know what will happen afterwards. I fear the unknown.
6706,Me too.
6707,"I am also, I love football."
6708,I only watch football on Sundays.
6709,Prom sounds exciting.  Do you have a date?
6710,Nice! That sounds so fun.  Are you taking her to dinner first?
6711,Music can do that to you sometimes. I listen to mine regularly.
6712,I would agree with that 100%
6713,"I know right. If you invade my personal space, prepare for backlash."
6714,"I hate that so much, people need to learn manners."
6715,Oh my gosh!  I would be mortified!  Did your face turn red?
6716,Wow!  That had to be so embarrassing!  I would probably quit my job!
6717,What all do you have stored so far?
6718,Do you also have a go-bag?
6719,"Yes, I do not like that either."
6720,"Never, I am a nice guy."
6721,"Me too, it throws my frequency off. "
6722,"I think noise reduction headphones would be perfect for you, try Bose or something."
6723,What kind of work did you do?
6724,I guess you got a lot accomplished then. Do you work a regular job too?
6725,Bummer. I enjoyed summer so much.
6726,But at least Christmas is around the corner. I love Christmas just as much as the summer!
6727,You can do it
6728,I'm working on my debt too.
6729,That would be a great time.  What did you do?
6730,I bet.  I would be too
6731,I bet you were. That is a great accomplishment! 
6732,Are you you guys going to celebrate?
6733,Like years. I use emails a lot but I don't feel the need to use actual paper letters. It's 2018!
6734,I know right. That kind of stuff is very nostalgic
6735,"It seems like an almost unachievable goal, especially at my age."
6736,"50, yeah, but It's just not the same."
6737,That sounds fun.  What kind?
6738,Those are really cool looking
6739,That must have been nerve-wracking?
6740,Sounds like you have a very responsible young lady growing up.
6741,"Me too, I feel you bro. It's ok at least make sure you are being productive."
6742,Try joining clubs or finding hobbies? Or you can always make friends on online video games!
6743,Sounds gross lol
6744,Omg. You should take your dog to an obedience school.
6745,Those are always so much fun. Catching up with old friends.
6746,Thats great. I have one coming up. I hope it turns out as good as your went.
6747,That is disappointing.  Is there other things you can apply for?
6748,Any other promotions where you are currently
6749,Congrats! You must be excited to start your career.
6750,I'm glad you stayed the course. There are a lot of big opportunities in store for you.
6751,Oh right.  I havnt heard of it.  Are you playing?
6752,Oh no what happened? Everything ok?
6753,Maybe you can bring it to the tire place. Maybe they can patch it real quick.
6754,Oh no I hate that feeling.  Is it better now?
6755,That is no good
6756,"Wow great,  are you happy with your purchase?"
6757,Congratulation! i hope you enjoy it.
6758,Was it a good deal?
6759,Excellent that it was a great value 
6760,"That's cool, what was the interview about?"
6761,Local or national?\
6762,are you making good money though ?
6763,well in that case way to go
6764,That is great.  Well done!
6765,I know that for sure.  I am working that myself.
6766,I hope you guys enjoy your visit! Are you guys really close?
6767,"Aww, I bet you miss her a lot. Well it's good you get to see her soon!"
6768,You must have felt nostalgic of the old days.
6769,I understand it is usually hard moving to a new city leaving some many people and placed behind
6770,What position was that?
6771,"Oh wow, I bet you were ready for that. Were you already working there?"
6772,That is great! I bet it feels good.
6773,It sure is and it gives you something to be proud of.
6774,"Great, when will you start?"
6775,"Fantastic, keep your spirits up and the sky's the limit."
6776,That’s great! I bet he is ecstatic!
6777,That is definitely something to you to be proud of!
6778,That sounds great!  How old is he?
6779,"Nice, Did you do any fun activities together?"
6780,have you thought about investing
6781,hopefully you will see great returns this year
6782,I hope everything goes well friend.
6783,Don't worry once they administer the anesthesia you shouldn't feel a thing.
6784,"thats awful, did it clean up easily?"
6785,well that's good to hear
6786,That's great! I hope you enjoyed the food..
6787,Keep it that way. If too many people find out it might ruin the experience.
6788,"Nice, softball is fun. I used to play baseball but always had fun playing softball in gym class"
6789,Yeah it's rewarding teaching kids and helping them learn how to become functioning human beings. I have a 2 year old nephew who's nuts and asks questions all the time
6790,That’s interesting. What did you have to do?
6791,That sounds cool!
6792,That's amazing. I have only been on a few planes in my life.
6793,I have not and will not ever.
6794,"Uh oh, did you apologize to the person after they answered or did you just hang up?"
6795,Oh wow! That's even worse than dialing a stranger. At least he didn't pick up!
6796,That is something I need too.  How did they get new so cheap?
6797,That sounds awesome
6798,It is very important to stay close to family.
6799,"That is wonderful to hear.  When times are tough, family is all you have in this world."
6800,You don't get any free time?
6801,OH. I know what you mean.
6802,Did you like them okay?
6803,I'm sure she'll have a fun year.
6804,I do too.  I have a fantastic recipe
6805,That is really nice!
6806,OH that sucks.
6807,Do you think the other person deserved it at all.
6808,Awesome!  What will you be doing?
6809,That is awesome. They chose you for a reason. You will do great!
6810,That's sad.
6811,That's really bad. What is she going to do about it>
6812,Have you eaten it all yet ?
6813,"Well, you've done well so far then ."
6814,I would have peed my pants.
6815,I am sure you are good at many other things though. 
6816,That’s ok.  If you would like to learn start simple
6817,I'm sorry for your loss. That sa to hear.
6818,It must be really tough. It will get better.
6819,Oh yea? What was the bet?
6820,Everyone's got that low minimum wage job at one point in their life sometimes.
6821,Take a power nap.
6822,They really do recharger you.
6823,That’s no good. How did she do that?
6824,That explains it!
6825,Did everything go okay?
6826,Your friend probably understands if you couldnt make it.
6827,"lol c'mon man, show some class."
6828,"I understand, sometimes you just gotta ""let a bomb drop""."
6829,Did it escape your house?
6830,Have you put out signs? contacted the animal shelter?
6831,Smores are a must when camping.
6832,I don't know. They probably brought their cell phones
6833,i have never been so lucky.
6834,I've found a couple of dollars and lighters in the washing machine. Thats about it lol
6835,Allergic to onions? I have never heard of anyone with that allergy. Must be tough 
6836,"I hate onions, I just don't like the texture of them"
6837,I would love to do that. Did it cost him much?
6838,Well he sure did save a lot in labor costs.
6839,Hoping the beta was okay.
6840,Oh wow. A fish freezing in the sun? Or was it winter and sunny?
6841,Did it?
6842,Like beige and brown?
6843,"That would be nice, but it's highly unlikely."
6844,It sure was.
6845,That sounds familiar.  Is there someone she can get it from?
6846,That’s a relief.  
6847,What did you yell at her for?
6848,"Oh, that is sad, I hope she knows mistakes happen!"
6849,Mario is such a classic. Haven't played smash since gamecube I think.
6850,Which character is your favorite?
6851,Why don't ou call her?
6852,Well send it to her with a note to say you miss her. She can call you if she has time.
6853,Oh. Who did you vote for?
6854,Wow. What does she do that peole would vote for her every year?
6855,I have never tried and never will lol
6856,That's what I think. Plus I'd miss bacon too much.
6857,You must be his role model! That's awesome.
6858,That's just funny! Well I'm glad to hear she's learning and improving! Good to start them young.
6859,What's inside?
6860,Why did she send you a shipment anyways? 
6861,Appreciate them while they are with you and try not to worry.
6862,It's unfortunately. If only we can all go together and not leave anyone behind.
6863,Well you seem to have done a great job parenting!
6864,"That is awesome, that is hard to come by"
6865,Do you guys still spend the holidays together?
6866,Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
6867,Oh no! Is what you have in there worth more than 500?
6868,I know but if there is nothing valuable in there just forget about it.
6869,I hate bullying. You should talk to the kiids parents.
6870,Beat the kids up. That's what I would do.
6871,For college?
6872,There's still another month of summer left where I am.
6873,I feel the same way. Everyone isn't as fortunate to have family.
6874,I learned a long time ago how important family is and now I have my own.
6875,Exactly
6876,What show is that?
6877,"I did not know it was ending, sorry to hear that!"
6878,What are your goals?
6879,Ah I see. It's always nice to have a goal to work towards.
6880,Are you keeping them?
6881,That's a lot to take in.
6882,Oh. How was it different to the previous ones?
6883,"Yea. Didn't warrant a new version, hu?"
6884,"I am sorry to hear that, why are you working extra?"
6885,"Ah, I know that all too well, best of luck"
6886,Where are you headed?
6887,"Me neither, sounds like fun!"
6888,That's an incredible achievement. He must've worked really hard.
6889,sometimes it's the one who keep it on the downlow who are the smartest.
6890,how did you like it?
6891,I'm not a big fan of spinach myself.
6892,Wow. I have been trying. How did you do it?
6893,That's great. I'll get there one day. I wanna see my great grandkids
6894,I didn't know they were recreating that game! When does it come out?
6895,I'll need to keep a look out for it!
6896,"That is terrible, I hope you feel better!"
6897,"Yeah, I hope so!"
6898,What dog breed is it?
6899,"Oh wow, that is an energetic dog, good luck!"
6900,"It sucks, but sometimes you just can't compare yourself to other people."
6901,"Yea, I get you. It's hard not to feel bad when someone seems to have it easier."
6902,"That's tough, it's good he has a friend like you to help him out though."
6903,It's good you have a close friend to count on too if needed.
6904,That's good to have reliable friends.
6905,How many years now?
6906,I think a lot of us have been afraid of the dark.
6907,I'm glad you're not afraid of it anymore though!
6908,Where are you going?
6909,"Ah, that should be fun, probably nice this time of year!"
6910,Why aren't you anymore? 
6911,What were you most afraid of at night?
6912,"That is amazing! I'm happy to hear that. I can relate, I feel like I have undiagnosed ADD."
6913,"I have a very hard time focusing on what I'm reading, so it can definitely slow down the learning process."
6914,I can relate to that! It's so mortifying because everyone begins to look at you like you're a bad parent!
6915,That's usually the main culprit of those situations!
6916,"I'd probably stay loyal too, after weighing the pros and cons, making a list for myself."
6917,"good for you, wish i could say the same for myself. I'm not unhappy, just got more work to do."
6918,Wow. Sounds like crazy stuff I wouldn't want to get involved in.
6919,Sounds like you're a lot more mature about it.
6920,I have not played it. Are you going to go back to the last and quit playing it?
6921,"Yes, I agree. I'd give it a week."
6922,Thats good. I hate that your having difficulties. 
6923,"Yeah its tough. But, we just got to keep working."
6924,"Im so sorry. I know the feeling, Im really sorry!"
6925,"Yes, I grew up with him and he got me through my parents splitting up and everything. (cause I didnt have many friends). I know everyone always says dont get another one too soon but for both my cats that passed and my dog, doing that really is what got me out of the rut. "
6926,"Oh man. At least, you've got some other assignments to bring that back up."
6927,I'm surprised school started alraedy.
6928,is it a major or minor surgery?
6929,i hope everything goes well !
6930,Families are really precious.
6931,Yea. So many people take their loved ones for granted.
6932,That is very sweet of them!
6933,"It sounds like it, people can be so sweet"
6934,"That's really sweet, I think most people feel the same way as you. Families are really important."
6935,I don't know what I would do without mine!
6936,When is she getting married?
6937,"Oh wow, are you one of the bridesmaids?"
6938,So many people cheat nowadays. That's good to hear!
6939,"It is, but we can learn from them and not do the same thing."
6940,"That is not good, how much will it cost?"
6941,"Oh wow, I could not afford that at all"
6942,"I am sorry, why did you break up?"
6943,"That is not fun, sorry to hear that..."
6944,What is your favorite nintendo console?
6945,"Portability? Ah, so it can play all the older games?"
6946,"It can help, but I could not watch it..."
6947,"Me neither, which sucks cause it pays well"
6948,That's good to hear. I think family is very important.
6949,I wouldn't be the person I am today without my family.
6950,Our family are the first people in our life.
6951,How many people are in your family?
6952,Is it still in good shape?
6953,Do you live far away from him now?
6954,That's great. How long have you two been tegether?
6955,Wow. That's a long time. Congrats!
6956,"That is a big burden, hope he is holding up okay"
6957,Thats really good. Trust is important in a relationship.
6958,That's the truth.
6959,I think I haven't play pokemon since Gameboy. What will this new one be about?
6960,Oh nice. Which one is your starter?
6961,That is a good accomplishment!
6962,"I would too, that is very impressive"
6963,What type of dog is it?
6964,"I have never heard of that, I have a MaltiPoo"
6965,Small family.
6966,"Thats sad. But, sometimes people need others to help take care of them."
6967,Its good that he's there for her.
6968,How did you do that?
6969,"That will do it, sorry to hear that!"
6970,Did that make you feel embarassed?
6971,How old were you when you overcame it?
6972,Why are you so tired?
6973,What is your job?
6974,People come into our lives for a reason sometimes.
6975,I'm glad they were for positive reasons for you.
6976,"I'm not much for eating out, I heard Chipotle is good though."
6977,Well I'm glad some people can enjoy it at least.
6978,Oh nice. What instrument did they play?
6979,That's pretty amazing!
6980,How did that happen?
6981,"That is very sweet of them, do not take them for granted!"
6982,Yep. You just said that.
6983,Do you have a guess?
6984,"I do too, that would not be good"
6985,That's awesome. How did you guys meet?
6986,"Oh man. Seems like if you didn't meet your sweetheart in school, it's more difficult to find a girlfriend."
6987,"That's exciting, what are you doing there?"
6988,Watch out for any spooky politicians haha.
6989,"Oh man, must make you feel bad."
6990,It's better not to compare your situation to others sometimes.
6991,"That is a lot of food, hope you can eat all"
6992,"That makes sense, hope you enjoy it!"
6993,she's a lucky girl.
6994,"Not a lot of guys say nice things about their girlfriends behind their back, haha!"
6995,That's nice to hear. How did you guys meet?
6996,You guys still in college?
6997,"That is a lot, I hope he does!"
6998,"I believe you, that would be hard to get around, a lot of money"
6999,"Wow, have you tried calling it?"
7000,"That is not good, where could you have left it?"
7001,They must have really been there for you.
7002,haha most of the time.
7003,"That's a lot of money, how did it go?"
7004,That seems unlucky. Was it your first time in the stock market?
7005,Oh wow. So who was the fairy?
7006,She's an awesome lady. You're one lucky person.
7007,were they expensive shoes?
7008,What shoes were they?
7009,When did you meet them?
7010,Nice. How long have you all been together?
7011,"Ah, well did you like the other person?"
7012,Why were you afraid?
7013,I see. I think I used to be afraid because I cuoldn't see anything.
7014,How was that? Must have been a throwback!
7015,"I am sorry to hear that, hope you get some more?"
7016,Super Smash Bros is a classic!
7017,How many people do you usually play with?
7018,What is it called?
7019,"Oh, why did it go out of business?"
7020,I hope you get the job!
7021,"Good, how big is your family?"
7022,How about your immediate family?
7023,Was the nightlight in your room?
7024,You're okay with it now?
7025,i like alone time
7026,i think its good to find a healthy balance between being alone and being social
7027,"That is super unfortunate, did you manage to save any of the fries by chance? "
7028,"I'm glad that you did not lose all of them, it would be terrible if you did all that work for nothing!"
7029,Why not? You only live once get out. Make the most out of every day!
7030,Sorry to hear that. How did you meet your lady friend?
7031,"i bet that was fun, were you nervous?"
7032,it was probably really exciting though too
7033,"A little bump in a relationship should not affect it, that is good. Always love and take care of her."
7034,"A key to a long relationship is persistence, so keep at it! "
7035,Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope there was no permanent damage!
7036,That had to be really scary for you.  I bet you will never make that mistake again!
7037,"Wow I could never do that, I really hate heights."
7038,You're pretty brave for conquering that fear.
7039,That is bad. What happened?
7040,Wow. Did you call the police?
7041,Yeah it sucks. I have noticed it too.
7042,I know and it is really sad.
7043,You really got lucky that day.
7044,Be sure to play the lottery.It looks like you are on fire.
7045,I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anyone around in your life?
7046,That's horrible! I hope you're trying to do some fun things to take your mind off the pain.
7047,How happy you must be!
7048,will he go to college?
7049,Aww how nice of him! I bet you were happy
7050,How long had it been since you had seen him?
7051,Oh I hate when I see that happen.
7052,Sometimes I think parents need a training class.
7053,That sounds troubling. How did your visit go?
7054,Well that sounds like it worked out fairly well fortunatley.
7055,Oh I hope you do get the job! What is it?
7056,"Well good luck, that sounds like a challenging role!"
7057,What are you going to do there?
7058,Are you going with anyone?
7059,Oh wow that's horrible. Was the kid ok?
7060,Haha. You already gave him a whole cake. Did he need more dessert?
7061,Sounds exciting! What's it about?
7062,Sounds like a really heartwarming story. Hope you have fun!
7063,Do you like her too?
7064,Give it a go. You might be soulmates.
7065,Were the lines long?
7066,I agree. More people should get involved to make a change.
7067,You will find the right one someday.
7068,"Oh, how come?"
7069,No one's perfect. Maybe you'll see her next time.
7070,I am so sorry to hear that.
7071,It must be devastating for her. Do you think she'll be able to overcome the loss?
7072,Your friend must be superman! (or woman) Lol
7073,"Yes he does. He deserves it, I hope he is going to the college that he wants to go to, all that hard work should pay off for him!"
7074,That's always disappointing. What were you wanting to buy?
7075,That's too bad.
7076,That's pretty cool. What are you going to do?
7077,"Oh wow, bungee jumping is a huge step!"
7078,"Wow, I""m surprised. Didn't know they were that generous."
7079,Oh ok. I was thinking it was New York where the cabbies are notorious for being rude.
7080,"That's awesome, you must have done something right to make a kid so bright."
7081,"That's the way to do it, clearly."
7082,It could be something good maybe.
7083,"I can only imagine how frustrating that is, that's why I work at home full time."
7084,I'm glad you got through it.
7085,How's life now?
7086,How old is he? Is he excited? 
7087,You will grow to love it. Football is amazing sport. Your son will love it. 
7088,Just wait a few years. If he sticks with it he will be at practice 6 months a year then playing games in the snow.
7089,Oh wow. How do you feel about that?
7090,People get lucky sometimes. It's better not to compare yourself to someone else.
7091,Are you anxious about it?
7092,Sometimes people are not thoughtful of other people's time.
7093,Yay! Congratulations! Have you been saving for awhile?
7094,That's so exciting! Best of luck with your new computer!
7095,Oh god. I hate that. What did you do?
7096,I'm sorry that happened. How much did it cost to repair?
7097,Pajamas are comfortable. No shame in that.
7098,For wearing pajamas?
7099,Oh wow! You must've been hungry.
7100,Will you be able to eat all that? 
7101,Some organizations are really life savers.
7102,"Not like mine then. So many fronting to donate, but they're actually stealing."
7103,I'm sorry to hear that but he is lucky to have you.
7104,"Yes you are, I'm sorry to hear about you losing them."
7105,"Sorry to hear that, the trouble of going to the doctor just to ""confirm"" its strep throat is the worst. It's like I know I have it, just help me!"
7106,"Hopefully you can avoid that, the swab to the back of your throat is a gross feeling!"
7107,Oh no! maybe she needs a break for a wahile
7108,That's no good. I guess you'll have to find a nicer game.
7109,"Oh, that's curious... By different, what do you mean? Did you buy different stuff, or go to a different store, or what?"
7110,"Oh yeah, totally. And then you don't end up buying too much or too little, and you don't waste time trying to remember things. There's also tons of little apps on your phone you can get that can make it really streamlined and convenient."
7111,"I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe give it one more try, and if you continue to like it, that might be your sign to stick with it. Good luck!"
7112,"Oh my gosh, that's so annoying! How did you deal with it?"
7113,That was a good solution! Smart thinking!
7114,"Well that's good, are you enjoying the new stove?"
7115,Wow how kind.
7116,It is always a bummer when you borrow something and it breaks right away. You feel responsible and have to replace it. 
7117,Did you end up buying him a new one?
7118,Were they related?
7119,That's terrible to be yelling at a kid who probably doesn't know any better.
7120,I hope she is okay also.
7121,You should go with her next time so that doesn't happen.
7122,I hope he's okay. I hate when my dog is sick.
7123,What is the dog's name? I'll say a puppy prayer for him
7124,Must make you feel jealous.
7125,Maybe they don't even have enough for the cars themselves.
7126,That is weird.  Do you know what happened?
7127,That is creepy.  
7128,Wow that would be a really awesome thing to discover! Did you use it for something fun?
7129,That is fun for everyone. Especially if you've been having hot sunny weather.
7130,You guys sound really happy together.
7131,That's wonderful. How long have you been together?
7132,Wow that sounds so scary!
7133,You must be pretty strong to do that.
7134,Well that's awfully generous of them. 
7135,Wow are they a very close friend?
7136,That's awful. I'm so sorry you had to experience that.
7137,Guess she's estranged for a reason.
7138,Nice. When was the last you have seen them?
7139,Why you didn't contact them?
7140,Will you explain it to them?
7141,"That's understandable. Hopefully, you won't make the same mistake next time."
7142,Yikes. Did she have to walk?
7143,Look at the bright side. She got some exercise. We all need more exercise.
7144,I'm so sorry to hear that. What did you guys find?
7145,You two must miss a lot.
7146,Good for you. I loved spending time with my grandma!
7147,She is the sweetest woman I have ever met
7148,That sounds crazy!
7149,What happened next?
7150,Nice. Did you pre-order?
7151,Sounds like it's gonna be a lot of fun.
7152,I know where this is going lol
7153,You obviously weren't alone
7154,That should be fun.  Does he live pretty far away?
7155,That has to be tough
7156,Oh no. Did you need it?
7157,Sometimes we forget stuff. It happens.
7158,What happened? 
7159,You could have still eaten it if you were daring.
7160,"Bright side, it would have been a great excuse to order pizza. "
7161,"A complete stranger? How the heck did that happen? I'm sure you must be confident that it's safe, if they're staying with you."
7162,"So, are they trying to apply for jobs and stuff? How long do you think you'll let them stay for?"
7163,I think we're just another number for them.
7164,I'm actually doing one now. Need better pay. I wish us both the best of luck.
7165,Oh no! Which author is it? That really stinks when you can't finish a story. An eternal cliff-hanger.
7166,That's a good idea. I know everyone is worried about that when it comes to George RR Martin and game of thrones.
7167,"Wow. He didn't get you one, hu? Thanks Dad."
7168,That's nice of you. I hope he feels better soon.
7169,It's great that your kids are having such a great relationship with their grandparents.
7170,"Yea, they do, but they're getting old. Makes me scared."
7171,That is a long time.  What are you going to do?
7172,That is  good.  Might be a good time to work on you
7173,That's insanely gross.
7174,He will be single forever.
7175,Tragic lol
7176,That is a great thought! What makes you so sure?
7177,I completely know the feeling. My kids are teenagers and I threaten them every day that I will move in with them when I am old and grey lol.
7178,"If only that actually worked, right? lol"
7179,Ugh that would freak me out! Did you ever find out if it was a real bat?
7180,Oh well that's lucky for you haha my three sons hate bugs!
7181,Why is it so shocking?
7182,Well she is married right? some people say sister in law before its official
7183,That sounds really good.  What kind do you like?
7184,That sounds great
7185,Oh. What's happening tomorrow?
7186,I hope you're able to tough it out.
7187,"That is amazing, did it lower your insurance rates too?"
7188,"That is a bummer, but congratulations on the highest score, that is something to be proud of. "
7189,Oh no! That sounds awful. Were you able to stop on the way home?
7190,Oh goodness! I am so sorry that happened to you! 
7191,That sounds wonderful. 
7192,Does he have a sister? lol
7193,"Holy cow, that's impressive. I bet they had to be carried back home. Did they even break a sweat?"
7194,"Haha, that's so funny. I bet it was even funnier to watch. I can kind of understand it--pho is really popular. I've had it and it's not bad. My girlfriend loves it and has it like once a week, along with spring rolls."
7195,"Oh god, I've been through that. At least, a bike is easy to clean?"
7196,Oh man. Sorry that happened.
7197,Make that wish when you blow out the candles
7198,Birthday wishes come true. You will have to work at it still though.
7199,aw how old are they now?
7200,You definitely need to teach them not to do that.
7201,What time is it there?
7202,Well they should prbabl shut it down soon. It is only Thursday.
7203,"Oh no, how come?"
7204,"Well, he sounds like he really loves you."
7205,He's definitely going to learn a lot. How long will he be away for?
7206,Will you miss him?
7207,Did he take good care of your car?
7208,That's great! Not too many 16 year olds are that responsible.
7209,That's awesome. Did you get nervous prior? 
7210,It gets easier as you get older. I'm sure you did great.
7211,That's sad. If you can't trust your family how can you trust. Are you going to say something?
7212,I don't know. If you let it go it could happen again and again.
7213,Those were the days. I remember buying 25 cents popsicles.
7214,yep. Those popsicles are like 1-3 dollars now
7215,What is it?  am curious.
7216,"Oh yes, and remember Bagel Bites!"
7217,Stop making me miss my childhood!
7218,Wide open? Or just unlocked? That's crazy! I guess you got lucky you didn't get robbed or have some animals become new roommates. Hard to believe decades ago people loved to go to bed with their doors unlocked.
7219,"Uh oh! That's scary. I bet you won't let that happen again. Well, I'm glad everything ended up okay."
7220,That is really a shame.  Too bad they won't get help for the kids
7221,You would think they would be motivated to keep their kids
7222,That is so disappointing. Will you stay there?
7223,That's too bad. Maybe explore some other options and see how you feel.
7224,That's really nice! What does he usually get at the store?
7225,Sounds a lot like me. I love going through the toys and gadgets section to see if I can find anything for my kids.
7226,I love a good surprise party.
7227,I never get gifts or a party. I need new friends and family
7228,That really stinks. What game did she used to play?
7229,"Yup. Because as soon as you give him a sweet stack of cash, he's probably going to blow it at the slots. "
7230,"Haha, why?"
7231,I disagree with both Democrats and Republicans.
7232,I am having a similar issue.  You shouldn’t have to pay for a service they aren’t providing. 
7233,That just isn’t right!
7234,Shopping is fun!  What do you plan on getting?
7235,Hopefully you will catch those great deals!  Sounds exciting!
7236,That;s awesome. high school?
7237,I bet you are so proud. I cried when my daughter graduated 6th grade lol
7238,In terms of grades or something else?
7239,Oh I see now. Wow that is pretty lucky!
7240,That's awesome that you devoted time to care for him!  How is he doing?
7241,That's great you got him up to a healthy weight!  Kudos on you!  I'm sure those spots will even out eventually.
7242,"Oh that's cool, having a nice new car always feel so sleek and cool."
7243,That's good!
7244,"Ah! That's always such a scary thing, because there's such a dreaded anticipation that goes along with it, a whole, ""Will it? Won't it?"" kind of game of seeing whether it will head in your direction. I live in the southeast, so I've dealt with worrying about plenty of them."
7245,"Yeah, there's always that fury of activity by everyone to go stock up on gas, groceries, and other materials like batteries, etc. So, did it ultimately end up hitting you, or no?"
7246,I really hope he gets accepted!
7247,You sound like an amazing father.  He is so lucky!
7248,I've never watched it but i've heard it's really good. Maybe I should give it a try
7249,Really? I will definitely give it a try. My favorite tv show is stranger things
7250,I know the feeling.
7251,Three dollars?
7252,Nice! What do you plan to do with a house empty of kids?
7253,I am glad for you. Sometimes kids can be annoying.
7254,Stressful. Was your work understanding? Is he ok?
7255,Is he feeling better?
7256,Like the creamsicles?
7257,You wouldn't believe. I'm eating one right now.
7258,Me too. They wer 50 cent on the ice cream truck.
7259,That's cool. I buy the box of six and don't share with anyone
7260,Why would you think that?
7261,Why would you think they are jerks?
7262,You must have lived there for a long time.
7263,WOW
7264,I am so sorry to hear that.  It will get better.
7265,"That seems pretty gross, especially the possums."
7266,Nice and congrats! How long have you been together?
7267,That's really nice. Been thinking about proposing to my girlfriend as well. We've been together for almost the same amount of time.
7268,I'm sorry who is going in too 8th grade?
7269,Oh awesome! Oh my gosh they do. I can't believe mine are in their 20's now! I hate it when they grow up honestly
7270,Holy cow that's amazing!  Good on you!  How much weight have you lost?
7271,Yeah I can relate.  I bet you feel and look amazing!  That determination is a quality to behold.  Keep working hard!
7272,Where were you?
7273,Did you forget your lines?
7274,Oh that's terrible. 
7275,I always hide my sweet whenever I buy any
7276,Hmmm sounds like an unpleasant job. Maybe they ask you for help because you're the only one around? It doesn't hurt to help those in need.
7277,That is a fair point. You can't have those that are there to protect us be distracted. This is a key tenant when I'm on watch in the Navy.
7278,"oh man, i'm glad you didn't get into an accident though. please be careful next time. did he give you a ticket?"
7279,At least he didn't take your driver's license and tow your car
7280,They did!  That is so terrible!
7281,"I'm sorry, maybe they will get back together."
7282,"That is cool, did you film it?"
7283,"That is awesome, is this your first kid."
7284,That's typically a nerve wracking experience. Did you meet any kind people?
7285,"Yeah, if it is a bad neighborhood I suppose."
7286,PHysics? I'm glad I never took that class.
7287,Are you looking for a career that involves physics?
7288,What is your degree in?
7289,"Wow, impressive. What do you want to do?"
7290,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.
7291,Well that's one nice thing to enjoy. That's sweet.
7292,I bet you did great!
7293,But that is still okay. Either way you accomplished something difficult!
7294,That's the best part of the day
7295,The first sip of a beer is pretty nice too lol
7296,Have you met them yet?
7297,That might be a bad sign
7298,Can't you see the driver on the app?
7299,Did you get a refund?
7300,Just eat a sandwich.
7301,Wow that's odd. At least you will save some money.
7302,What is her style?
7303,Lol have fun
7304,Wow that will surely be a rewarding career. I am impressed that you want to help others.
7305,Yeah I felt bad luckily he forgave me though.
7306,"I'm sorry to hear that. We're all human, and that does happen sometimes. I guess all you can do is do your best to not say or do anything you can't take back. Is everything resolved now?"
7307,"Ah, an argument with your spouse? Those are always tricky. I hope you guys can work through it amicably, because that's obviously an important relationship."
7308,Wow. How old is she now?
7309,how old is the valentine
7310,Thats sweet though
7311,Why did you ask for onions then?
7312,Oh I was confused.
7313,Well did you get your money back?
7314,Im sorry to hear that.
7315,It will get better. I know that is a tough thing.
7316,Oh yeah? What kind of car?
7317,"Hey at least it is still a car, don't feel bad."
7318,Oh I know what you mean! Its so weird because for that first month or so you like dont even fit in..
7319,I hope you eventually made friends! I know how much it stinks to feel left out of everything
7320,I do hate flooding as well
7321,Thank goodness nothing flooded then
7322,You can lose weight too.
7323,Have you tried?
7324,Did you love it? That was sweet
7325,Maybe she should take some art courses.
7326,Maybe not lol
7327,That's no good. Are you going to report him to the police?
7328,"Yeah, mentally ill people shouldn't even be allowed to have dogs. There should be a screening process."
7329,Oh my lord! How are you still alive?
7330,Be careful! You can puncture your stomach like that and not make it. It happens to those with bulemia all the time. Stay safe!
7331,How do you think you did once you took the test?
7332,I am sure you knocked that test out of the park - sweat or not.
7333,Awesome!  Happy Birthday.  What are you going to do?
7334,That sounds like a great plan!
7335,I'm sorry. I bet you you miss her. That is so hard.
7336,That sounds like a really good idea to do. 
7337,That's a good thing.
7338,That's really good. What class is it?
7339,5?
7340,Psychology made me sleepy lol
7341,Did you move to the country?
7342,Well you have to be safe
7343,Then you definitely have to be dafe
7344,Of course lol
7345,Some people are less fortunate
7346,Well you should cherish them and let them know how you feel.
7347,"oh no, what did you do"
7348,wow you are a brave soul
7349,They might win the east
7350,They should be pretty good
7351,Congrats for your brother! When is the wedding?
7352,Fall is a wonderful time to have it. Are you going to be the best man?
7353,Staying in is good sometimes
7354,Netflix is always nice
7355,Well that's nice. What are you going to do?
7356,That's pretty cool. I don't see my friends much since I moved.
7357,That is commendable.  I try to
7358,I absolutely agree
7359,I would be far more surprised if you did.
7360,That's just stastics.
7361,was everyone ok?
7362,oh no
7363,In a cool antique way or a disgusting way?
7364,That is so gross. Did you complain to them?
7365,Is it getting boring?
7366,What do you do?
7367,thats the worst!
7368,yea thats rude
7369,Ooo! What kind was it?
7370,Oh! Great choice for the environment. Are you going to save up?
7371,what are you gonna do? partyyyyy?
7372,that sucks
7373,I know what you mean. That's no fun.
7374,Do you have any hobbies or do you like to read?
7375,I'm sure it will be helpful
7376,Bigger vehicles are so convenient for stuff like that!
7377,"Yes, it seems like that was just a couple of months ago."
7378,Before we know it we will be voting for president again.
7379,"That is a horrible feeling I know, but you can start over again the next day."
7380,Don't be too hard on yourself. Allow yourself to indulge every so often.
7381,What did you do while they are gone?
7382,Aww.  Why?  Did something happen?
7383,Yikes.  How are you today?  
7384,That was nice of her.
7385,Do you stay in touch?
7386,"Weekdays always seem to pass so slowly, but weekends fly by not even noticing them"
7387,Do you have any plans for this upcoming weekend?
7388,Nice! Do you see yourself marrying her?
7389,I hope everything turns out good for you two!
7390,That's cool. I don't watch too much. Are you a fan?
7391,Are the cowboys your favorite team? I prefer watching college. 
7392,Wich one?? My favorite was the shining 
7393,"Yes, that one is very scary"
7394,"I am too, things are going great."
7395,I'm glad you're being enthusiastic.
7396,What did you lie about?
7397,I assume you were trying to be a good friend and protect them?
7398,Where did you go after you left?
7399,"Nice, what SUV?"
7400,I need to google that. Is it a big SUV?
7401,My sons are always talking about the new video games coming out. What game are you waiting on?
7402,I have never heard of that game. I bet it will be fun though.
7403,What kind of paintings does she do?
7404,"Wow, does she sell them anywhere?"
7405,That's not a reason to dislike someone.
7406,Yeah I do to. Does he plan on losing weight?
7407,You like Donald Trump?
7408,"Me too, he's so real. He loves what I love. MMA, poker, guns, WWE, hahahah"
7409,"Yes, but do you drive safe?"
7410,True but the odd's are slim.
7411,I'm sorry that you feel lonely.
7412,"Absolutely, never be a victim."
7413,happy birthday! What year is it?
7414,Time flies fast! Make sure to do what you love and be with who you love
7415,Oh I bet she will love that. How old is she?
7416,Don't let the secret slip!
7417,I am sure it was well-deserved.
7418,Oh man I am so sorry! I have lost many this year too. I hope he had a long life
7419,Oh man! What happened?
7420,I sorry that you have to deal with that.
7421,"Yeah, you need to get of there quickly."
7422,Why?  Previous bad experienec?
7423,True.  It's always good to go outside with a friend.  And don't forget your towel!
7424,"I wish that was not the case, I would have came."
7425,I hope you have much brighter days moving forward.
7426,Oh wow! I would have been scared to let mine do such a thing.
7427,"That's good to hear. She must have a lot of your trust, sounds like a bright young lady!"
7428,Is that relaxing to you or lonely? 
7429,Try to enjoy the quiet but not get down.
7430,Well congratulations!
7431,"I'm sorry to hear that, did you lose your job?"
7432,I hope things work out for you.
7433,Didn't you check your bought items more thoroughly before putting them in a bag
7434,Seems some irresponsible employee of theirs mis-categorized the items when putting them in those shelves
7435,Thats too bad. I hope everyone remained respectful. Seems like everyone is being kind of childish about politics lately and getting mean fast instead of keeping it decent.
7436,"I am seeing a lot of nastiness. Yes, just remember everyone can agree to disagree and be ok. I hope everything is ok!"
7437,How exciting! I am jealous!
7438,That sounds very fun. I might have to take you up on that offer. I have a good friend that just moved there.
7439,"Do you trust them to be home alone?  I bet you're scared, huh?"
7440,That's good.  You're a good parent!  Good luck with everything!
7441,I hope you guys are always safe!
7442,I wish I was a good driver!
7443,That sounds fun! 
7444,I bet place that is so big you can't go through it all in one day
7445,That's no good. Did you study?
7446,I understand that. That just means you have to excel at the rest of your assignments so you have a chance to average it out!
7447,That is so sad. I am sorry.
7448,That's a very nice way to think of it.
7449,Oh how exciting!  What is it?
7450,Awesome!  I'm sure you will do amazingly.  Keep your head up!  Fake it til you  make it LOL
7451,"Aww, that is so sweet."
7452,You are lucky to still have that.
7453,Wow have you gone for a ride in it?
7454,"That's so cool, maybe one day you can save enough for you rown."
7455,Oh is the new extra space a good thing?
7456,I can imagine that being a bit lonely.
7457,I know how that feels. It is horrible!
7458,That is good to hear that it doesn't happen anymore.
7459,sorry to hear that. What happened
7460,"sorry, i hope they apologized for that"
7461,"sorry about that, did you try checking on another store?"
7462,"am sorry, maybe you should wait until they are restocked"
7463,"I'm sorry, did everything get resolved?"
7464,I'm glad everything worked out.
7465," Oh my gosh, seriously???"
7466,I am so sorry ab out that I hope things get better soon
7467,That is so annoying. Maybe you'd have to get a chart to keep track.
7468,That is too bad. I am sorry you have to deal with that.
7469,Congratulations! You must be so proud.
7470,Wow it sounds like he has life all planned out.
7471,"Oh yeah, do you love basketball a lot?"
7472,Well I hope you enjoy it!
7473,Did everything turn out okay?
7474,We all have our moments.
7475,"That's horrible. Must have been annoying, huh?"
7476,"Wow, that's very fortunate. Mothers are great."
7477,That's great! What's going on?
7478,That's nice that you have a friend like that.
7479,"Wow, that sounds like a very busy household. How are you able to manage them all?"
7480,A nanny is a good idea. Would you consider using contraceptives? 
7481,If you don't like such movies you should have told him at the beginning so he choose  a non scary one
7482,It's ok though at least now you know that scary movies are not your kind of movies
7483,"Ouch! I know that hurts, been there too. Does it feel better now?"
7484,"Yes, it makes you want to say more than darn, that's for sure!"
7485,Why did you go to the movies by yourself?
7486,That is great being so independent.
7487,"Ooh, did you pick your own numbers?"
7488,That's awesome! I hope you win!
7489,was it a young kid? sad nonetheless
7490,Oh that's great! I tend to follow some missing children stories closely but I hate when there's a sad outcome
7491,Ooh how fun you must have many adventures planned.
7492,Well I hope it is super awesome!
7493,"I'm sorry to hear that, do you know any way to help yourself calm down?"
7494,Well you could also try praying! 
7495,Wow that's fantastic!
7496,You are very lucky to have such a smart boy!
7497,"Holy heck are you okay? Was it like, a fender bender or a full on collision? "
7498,Freaking idiots on the road. Is your insurance going to be able to cover the damage?
7499,Oh that sucks! I can barely do 5 without needing a break
7500,That's quite unfortunate. I feel for you as I used to live in a small town where jobs were scarce. It's rough when there is no competition
7501,Oh that's never fun. I hate that too.
7502,That is so cool you are moving into the job market. Yay!
7503,I trust you did well too
7504,How does it make you feel when you think about them?
7505,Aww I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can regain contact with them someday. I'm sure they'd love to hear from you.
7506,Oh maybe you should try joining  achurch.
7507,"those were the good times, now kids just want to be on their phones"
7508,I used to love riding my bike around the block
7509,"Oh no, that's terrible. Can it be replaced?"
7510,What kind was it?
7511,That's sweet of her! You should put them all together in a nice photo album.
7512,That is very kind. I'm honestly doubt that my grandma even knows what a printer is.
7513,sorry to hear that. Sometimes there can be a technical  problem
7514,"sorry about that, seems their customer service is not welcoming"
7515,Some people think they know all the answers. It's sad as they usually don't grow as much as people
7516,"I hope he does, for his sake. But I imagine he will come around"
7517,"If you report him to his wife, the shame will make him pay you back"
7518,"Then talk to someone that he respects maybe they will talk senses into his ""head"""
7519,It's a chance to turn a new leaf by  getting a high score even without cheating
7520,That's good. The first step towards turning new is to resolve and take action. 
7521,Good for you! Stealing from anyone is a really bad offence. 
7522,"Having proof is awesome, otherwise it would make your case a hard one to prove."
7523,"Wow, I would have been upset! How did you react?"
7524,Are they going to pay you back for it?
7525,"Wow, you must have done lots of reading then? i dont get As all the time"
7526,thats great. They now have confidence in you
7527,No. I hope it was a pleasant day for you and not sad
7528,If you know where you're going then you should be
7529,That is very nice
7530,Did they brought any special gift?
7531,That is terrible! Why did you blame him?
7532,I'm glad you understand that now.
7533,"Oh lol, I'm sure it was embarrassing but it's happened to most, so understandable. "
7534,"I'm sure, I'd be the same way too!"
7535,Are you stoked about something good?
7536,That's great!  Where are you headed for your vacation?
7537,Do you have anything you want to see there?
7538,I feel the same as long as I am treated with respect
7539,That is interesting
7540,I have felt like that as well :)
7541,"I think the reason is because we want to know if they would fit or not or if we made a mistake or not, that's how it is when it's not bought from a physical store"
7542,Wow. You must be very proud
7543,I wonder if he was self motivated
7544,"Awh, that really bites. It's the worst when it feels like everyone is having fun without you."
7545,That's right! It will all pay off for you in a few years.
7546,What is it about them that you don't like so much?
7547,"Ah yes, I know that feeling. Sitting in traffic is a major drag. I find that music or podcasts help it go by quicker"
7548,Aww!  Tell me about it will you?  
7549,You should go to reddit.com/r/eyebleach.  There's nothing there but cute and nice things to look at.  It will ease your soul.
7550,That's very unfortunate. That cashier needs to find a job they actually like doing.
7551,They're supposed to either do that for you or get someone else to 
7552,I understand. It is difficult to have everyone staring at you
7553,That's great! I don't know too many people who look forward to that. You must love your job
7554,Great! I wish I loved my job and work environment as much as you do
7555,I feel the same about my dog. They really are like family members.
7556,I will just think they are happily watching down over us and try to go on one day at a time.
7557,Oh really?!  Tell me about it I'm excited to hear!
7558,Oh that is freaking awesome!  Congrats!  How are you going to treat yourself??
7559,You must be a very special person to her. Is she single? 
7560,"Too bad, oh well, if things turn around in her status, you have someone in her that you can consider"
7561,Oh no! I hope you can make it! 
7562,"Whoa, that's quite a walk! I hope that doesn't happen. Do you have anyone to call for help?"
7563,"Oh no, what happened? "
7564,Who can blame you? We are taught to trust professionals.
7565,Why's that?
7566,Oh excellent.  What is your dream car?
7567,Are you buying it outright?
7568,What color are you shooting for?
7569,That is a great accomplishment!
7570,"Congratulations, I'm sure it will be a good PC."
7571,Good memories I take it? I loved not having to make it myself
7572,"Aw, well that's good that it did. I'm sure she wanted it to be!"
7573,Was she a bad employee?
7574,Then what caused you to fire her?
7575,"sorry about that, you could have called a friend"
7576,"yah, or get a comedy or get to watch a movie"
7577,Yeah I remember those days too!  What was your favorite gift from a family member?
7578,Go Grandma!  What an awesome gift.  I bet you were stoked! :D
7579,Excellent!  Those thoughts are beautiful.  Have a good day :)
7580,How exciting! Do you know what your destination will be?
7581,Nice! It will be a good time to relax and enjoy the beach and nightlife!
7582,"Oh, I know that feeling! I only just got my first decent smartphone this past year!"
7583,It's definitely different than what I was used to. It's crazy how fast technology upgrades. Sometimes I feel like a caveman.
7584,I am sure you will find a great girl soon!
7585,Just be patient and everything will fall into place.
7586,Oh no! I hope it goes well as I've heard those can be tricky procedures
7587,You'll be fine! Having hope is the best you can do
7588,Really? It is a fine movie
7589,Ok. I understand
7590,Oh my god. What did you do?
7591,"That's great, I hope you weren't hurt!"
7592,Oh that's terrible.  Did he say how he lost it?
7593,Do you remember the title?  Maybe you can get another copy.
7594,How was that for you? Are you close?
7595,I'll bet. It's always nice to see someone who can bring back good memories.
7596,"Why? Was it because you didn't take those last few moments to spend time with her? Sometimes we have so much going on, we don't have time to do it all!"
7597,"Oh, no, I'm sorry to hear that. You had no idea that would be the last visit, but I can understand how you would feel that way. I have no doubt she understood why you didn't though."
7598,"Ooh, that's cool! What did you have in mind? "
7599,That's a good idea. What restaurant were you thinkin? 
7600,That's awesome. What kind of job?
7601,You'll do great! That's right up your alley.
7602,"I've never been in one, but I always assumed they were cleaner!"
7603,"Ew, that's gross. Some people have no sense of decency. "
7604,Oh really?  What's the good news?
7605,That's great!  What finally convinved the boss?
7606,It's good to get noticed for that.  most of the time you only get attenton for messing up!
7607,What model or brand of laptop were you considering?
7608,Nice! So you've had a good experience with that brand?
7609,That's fantastic! Congratulations! Is it at a restaurant or home prepared?
7610,"That sounds awesome, honestly. I hope you enjoy it!"
7611,Aww that's too bad.  What was the cause?
7612,"That's pretty rough.  Were her last years happy, at least?"
7613,"I'm sorry you feel that way. If you feel that you do good, honest work, you should demand better pay!"
7614,"If it's a personal matter, I would definitely take the issue over to human resources. It's better to stand up for yourself."
7615,How long has he been a swimmer?
7616,As you should be. I wish I liked to swim.
7617,"Oh my gosh, that's such a heavy thing to think about. Did you ask her or confront her?"
7618,"Well, I hope they've figured it out together during this time. "
7619,That sounds like a wonderful surprise. Was it something that you had seen before?
7620,Are you going to wear it or put it up for safe keeping?
7621,Those tests can be stressful. How did you do?
7622,Awesome! Congratulations! It is always nice to accomplish something like that.
7623,Sorry to hear that. How that happened?
7624,I understand. Those thing happened from time to time.
7625,That's so nice! What did you get her?
7626,"Wow, that is really thoughtful."
7627,Ouch that's rough. Maybe she just isn't ready. 
7628,Do you have any proof? If so you should bring it up to her.
7629,oh you mean not having enough to pay your rent?
7630,I am sure there is a special friend that can help you with that amount and when you have you can repay them back
7631,Oh no! Are you thinking about buying another one?
7632,"The meaningfulness is definitely something you can never replace. I hope that it shows up, and if not, I hope this watch brings meaning to your life in new ways."
7633,"Wow, that's... odd.  Was it for a cake?"
7634,Hahaha Sorry I just assumed you were 5 years old or something.  Yeah getting practical gifts is more appealing as one gets older.
7635,What kind of things did you get?
7636,"These days that is a great gift, am I right?"
7637,"If it wasn't your fault, then what caused you to lose?"
7638,"Multiplayer games can be fun, but that's certainly a downfall to them!"
7639,Oh my. How did that happen?
7640,I see. Well it's an honest mistake. I've done different socks before
7641,"You will be fine, just get a new one"
7642,"I understand how you feel, I used to have one like that, when It passed away, I got a puppy of the same exact breed and gave it the same name. with a few month, It looked like the one that passed away so It helped me to forget "
7643,Really? did you use marijuana ?
7644,Did you?
7645,"Wow, I bet that's exciting, but also makes you a bit nervous. Congratulations though, I'm sure you are proud to do it!"
7646,"Well, I would probably feel the same way, but I'm sure you will be great. If they didn't have confidence in your abilities, they wouldn't have chosen you to do it!"
7647,Oh no! I hope you were able to get over the disagreement.
7648,"Customer service is very important, and it seems like that place needs to work on that."
7649,What's wrong with your sight?
7650,"That's good ,a speed recovery I must say.I commend the opticians"
7651,"Well, if the milleage is not too much and the car is clean go for it"
7652,"I think in situations like this, you can take someone that knows about cars along"
7653,Congratulations! That is such a big step in life.
7654,What is his name?
7655,What's got you feeling down?
7656,How inconvenient! Are you going to take it to a technician?
7657,What was she doing?
7658,There is a lot of that type of behavior now. It's like people have lost their minds.
7659,That's awesome. What did you end up getting?
7660,I love chocolate cake! You'll have to save me some.
7661,"That can be sad, but luckily you can plan to visit them in the future."
7662,"Yes, using social media really helps us connect with friends and family so much better."
7663,"Oh yea, I've had it happen a few times. It's even worse when they ""lose the package"" for a while"
7664,I don't blame you. I try to keep tabs on them because I don't trust they will be delivered in time. I also set up a camera to catch deliveries that don't deliver :}
7665,Congratulations! I'm sure it's well deserved!
7666,How are you going to celebrate?
7667,I hate having car troubles! What is it this time?
7668,"My sister is recently going through the exact same thing. It was frustrating for her for a while, but things are looking up for her! I'm sure they will for you as well."
7669,Of what?
7670,Nice reminiscent
7671,Oh yeah? What about?
7672,"Oh no, that is sad news indeed. I am sorry to hear that."
7673,That's a shame. Is there someone else who can go with you? I'm available. LOL
7674,I'm sure she really wanted to go. Sometimes we have to make choices we don't like. My offer still stands. 
7675,What was your experience like?
7676,"I love looking at old photos, both happy and sad moments."
7677,Me too! What did yours look like? 
7678,"Wow, that must've been really spoooky."
7679,not for the time
7680,I'm happy to hear that
7681,You must've worked hard to get there
7682,What were you expected to be served?
7683,So how did you handle it?
7684,Why is that? and what was 
7685,Congratulations. You must have the gods smiling on you
7686,Happy birthday to him! What did he get? 
7687,"I bet, those sound like awesome presents!"
7688,That's awful. Did you have to cheat?
7689,I hope she has forgiven you then
7690,"Oh, no! I hope you are feeling better! Did you go to the doctor to see why?"
7691,That was very sweet and thoughtful too. Glad you're better!
7692,"Wow, that's a long time! Kudos to you. It's hard for me to imagine being in one place for that long"
7693,"Yea, benefits and pay seem to be the common motivators. I'm glad it worked out so well for you!"
7694,"You will be alright, it's always like that "
7695,"Think about the positive aspects of this, you are moving forward"
7696,Really? What sort of things have you done that make you feel that way?
7697,"That sucks, hopefully nothing you can't replace. I'd suggest getting some help if your drinking has become distructive."
7698,Why? What happened?
7699,"I see. lol. I hate cats, sorry"
7700,"OK ,why would you in the first place?"
7701,"Well ,you played hard! But did you work hard?"
7702,That's ok
7703,Tell me all about it
7704,"ok, so sweet"
7705,your confident to very best of luck
7706,"yes, my patner is very important relationship."
7707,"Sorry about that, what is wrong"
7708,"sorry, those horror movies can scare you to death."
7709,Are you high young man? It's just wednesday..hahaha
7710,"Oh ok, I understand. Well, I have this girl that I have been wanting to date. I want to ask her to be my girlfriend this weekend"
7711,This is true.  I have often been told that I am the best.
7712,Where do you go to school?
7713,Whoa! What was in that burrito?
7714,"Wow, that's a food challenge type of thing! Did they get anything out of it?"
7715,That's great! What was it about?
7716,I'm glad you really enjoyed it!
7717,Good for you. Don't live with regrets. Learn from mistakes and move on.
7718,That's a weird term to use
7719,Why? Did something bad happen to you?
7720,"Well, I'm glad no one was hurt at least. :)"
7721,That's cool! Has it been a good transition?
7722,It can be stressful sometimes. I am glad to hear you found something good.
7723,Thats sweet.  How long have they been married?
7724,Yes it is.. thats great that their love has lasted so long.
7725,That's good! You should always encourage your children's talents and let them grow
7726,I do not. I am still pretty young so I'd like to wait a few more years. I don't think I'm quite ready
7727,Oh that's good. You will make some good money while having a good time remembering childhood
7728,oh ok I understand 
7729,LOL. Sorry. Was it embarrassing or did you laugh it off?
7730,Oh my. But why do you care if they're your cousin..
7731,Really? Please tell me more
7732,So what did you do ?
7733,That is quite interesting. You must be proud of yourself!
7734,I am glad you are. A good career is essential to live a healthy life.
7735,Congrats! Where are you going?
7736,OH I'm so jealous! Have lots of fun!
7737,Oh I love camping.   Was it relaxing?  Sometimes camping can be work.
7738,Im glad.. it seems like we both are getting the vacations we need!
7739,That's great to here. Anything good happen recently?
7740,Sounds like you are doing great. Those are among the best things in life.
7741,You did super well I guess
7742,your parents must be really proud of you
7743,Oh no! I hope your toe is feeling better!
7744,Luckily it will heal soon and you can feel back to normal.
7745,Thats so sweet.
7746,"thats super nice, thanks for sharing."
7747,Oh no! Was it traumatic?
7748,That's nuts! I would have been so scared
7749,"The little ones always feel so fragile, what did you do?"
7750,"Little ones love rockers or swings, did you have a good time watching your cousin?"
7751,What grade did he get? He doesn't have to get an A in everything.
7752,That's quite harsh for getting one bad grade. You should encourage him to do well without being so rash.
7753,"I am sorry to hear that, You can take it again though and try to get a better grade!"
7754,"Oh, that is not good. You should have done better!"
7755,"Well, good thing is you realized your mistakes "
7756,You should get your mind ready for the worst if he does not take it too well
7757,Thats always a good thing.  Did you give them a fun reward?
7758,Thats so cool..  I live in Orlando.. I'll wave to you guys!
7759,Wow! That is really impressive!
7760,Luckily the phone didn't fall and crack the glass! Those phone covers aren't the best.
7761,I bet he was stoked.
7762,yea i 100% agree with that.
7763,"Oh wow, what subject is it on?"
7764,Well I hope you do good either way.
7765,"That is sad, Why were you not able to go?"
7766,Oh maybe next time!
7767,I'm sorry to hear about that.  I hope you both can find a way to work things out with each other.
7768,"Oh, that's too bad.  Well then I hope you can find happiness again in the future.  Good luck to you!"
7769,That was nice of you. What type of food did you bring?
7770,I see. That was nice of you to repay your friend with the meal.
7771,Oh that sucks sounds like a good movie tho.
7772,yea the cgi in movies is stellar.
7773,Oh no.  Don't say that!  I start a new job today!
7774,Why don't you talk to yours?  Im so sorry!
7775,That is disgusting! You must talk to him about this!
7776,"Incredible, kick him out of the house!"
7777,Oh no! Sorry to hear that. How are you planning to get it fixed?
7778,"Ah, I see. Well I hope you figure it out soon. You need a way to get around town!"
7779,"That sounds fun! I've never been myself, but I've always wanted to"
7780,I shall :) I need to make myself get out more. It would be good for me
7781,Maybe you should buy it for keep sake 
7782,"oh ok, I understand"
7783,Oh that's got to be very tough! I'm sorry to hear that. How did you respond?
7784,That would be pretty shocking overall! I hope you're able to move on from this somehow.
7785,oh really find anything cool?
7786,yea all of the nostalgia can do that.
7787,You must felt really lonely because you need friends in college
7788,I bet it can. I had no friends in college either.
7789,Congrats. I hope you'll like what you're doing
7790,That's like the toughest job out there.
7791,Uh oh! So what happened? Did you end up passing it?
7792,"That's great. Good for you, bud."
7793,Where did you land in then? India or something?
7794,Aw well that seems like it would be a great time! I hear the beaches are beautiful.
7795,Oh my goodness! Why did you do that?
7796,You should tell your wife to clear your guilt.
7797,oh my god!. I hope he loves her as much as you do
7798,Did she know that  you crushed on him?
7799,Oh that sounds kind of worrisome.
7800,well thats a relief.
7801,Did he? Where do you both go to school?
7802,"I bet it was, college is such a great time."
7803,Wow that sounds pretty stressful. How do you think you did?
7804,"As long as you did your best, I say have no regrets. You made the most of a bad situation."
7805,That's great! I'm happy for you. Will you be getting a raise?
7806,I'll cross my fingers alongside you. It sounds like you deserve it!
7807,Oh that must have been awkward.  Did you two talk to each other?
7808,I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you don't dwell on it too much and can be happy in the future.
7809,"Wow, where did you do that?"
7810,That's awesome! I really want to go paragliding someday.
7811,"Oh my, what did you do?"
7812,"Its okay, hopefully it was not too expensive1"
7813,That's a very exciting time in life. Do you have any preference for gender?
7814,I've heard that as well. I'm male I know I was much closer to my mom.
7815,He will turn out to be a great man
7816,Oof i know how that can feel.
7817,yea that would help clear you concision 
7818,ok how did you manage the situation?
7819,I think you should have talked to the hostel management to help you out on this as well
7820,That has got to be hard on the poor guy. Did you offer any help?
7821,I see. Well he's probably still there.
7822,Oh wow! That's horrible! Did it fall down the drain?
7823,Well hopefully she should be able to forgive you. It was an accident.
7824,They're not very good friends then. You should confront them about this.
7825,"Could be, hopefully the wont dismiss you like that in the future!"
7826,"Oh my, I hate when that happens. It makes me so angry."
7827,"I would be too, some people shouldnt be driving. "
7828,oh yea why is that?
7829,oh wow thats so stupid of him.
7830,"That is great, did you get the license?"
7831,Well hopefully you ace it!
7832,That sounds great! What's your meeting about?
7833,That sounds really interesting. Hopefully you'll get rewarded for your great performance!
7834,Oh that sucks but i think he should understand the situation.
7835,thats unfair of him.
7836,Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Were you hurrt?
7837,Hopefully insurance will be able to cover the car at least.
7838,Oh wow that is an awesome car.
7839,"i can imagine you would, its an awesome situation."
7840,You shouldnt feel bad. It happens to all of us at some point.
7841,"Its okay, it was just an accident."
7842,I would be really frustrated with that as well. Did you exchange the colors?
7843,Well it sounds like she's listening to you at least.
7844,Congratulations. You have done well
7845,I wish I can attend a party for this if there is
7846,"I agree, these shop mechanics can be extremely knowledgeable when it comes to computers."
7847,"yea but at least now you have found a good, trustworthy place."
7848,Well that sounds like a good thing to do.
7849,Well I'm happy for you as well that your needs are being meet.
7850,He should be understanding of that and not keep on. That's just frustrating for everyone involved
7851,Sounds very immature if you ask me
7852,"Omg!, does the place have camera? at least so that the police can track down the person"
7853,If you have insurance I think you will be fine
7854,"oh that sucks, i know how that feels, its why i got an extra job online"
7855,Yea it was scary but im happy its not bad anymore.
7856,I agree. Do you have a new car?
7857,Oh cool. I love visiting car shows myself.
7858,OK let me in on it
7859,So what was the experience like ?
7860,Why does that make you feel bad? You're allowed to have fun sometimes.
7861,Oh that would be tough. Have you told your partner?
7862,You must be quite hopeful to get this new job then! I hope you do as well.
7863,"I agree, but stay positive. There is nothing you can do now."
7864,I hope I will still be helping my kids when they are grown up. I like to feel they will always need me. 
7865,"Yes, but they can be a bit of a challenge when they are growing up!"
7866,You should definitley pick them up again. Don't let age stop you!
7867,lol well as long as you're fairly active and fit it shouldn't be too big of a problem.
7868,"Why, did you hesitate in the first place?"
7869,"I see than, I could tell you that you should just overcome yourself and do it, but its you own personal business..."
7870,Wow that sounds rough! Have you told your wife about it?
7871,I could imagine. I hope you're able to work through this somehow.
7872,Is there still time to get one? You can if you hurry!
7873,Hmm I think you should make it up to her somehow. Take her to an expensive dinner. 
7874,Oh my goodness. Who is that guy?
7875,What an impostor. 
7876,"It's a great stage in your life, what is he majoring in?"
7877,Well I wish luck to both of you.
7878,Is there anything that could spoil that?
7879,"Seems like you took all the precautions, the rest is not up to you."
7880,I hate when that happens.  Things always seem to go that way.
7881,All you can do is just keep doing the best job you can and hopefully someone will notice someday.
7882,Your dog doesn't keep you good company?
7883,I guess so but it should be able to alleviate a lot of that loneliness.
7884,Congrats. Boy or girl?
7885,I'm having a boy soon. 3 months or so
7886,sorry to hear that. I hope he is okay now
7887,he will be okay as long he got the tratment
7888,"Well, early happy birthday. What will you do to celebrate?"
7889,Thats great. Enjoy your day.
7890,"Well you knew that you would have to let go one day, didn't you?"
7891,"We have only one option when it comes to change, embrace it!"
7892,I feel you. I need a new one asap. POS falling apart. Cost me lots for a repair recently
7893,They're not cheap let me tell ya
7894,"That's great, how much did you win?"
7895,Still more than you started with.  For that ticket anyway.  LOL.  Congrats.
7896,Oh that sounds like so much fun! I love animals!
7897,Hopefully she'll get more interested when she gets a bit older.
7898,What happened to the cat??
7899,My condolences to the owner. 
7900,That is so aggravating! I am sorry to hear this happened to you!
7901,Call the police! I hope you nab these guys and put them in jail!
7902,That sounds horrible. Are you trying to motivate them?
7903,I can understand the feeling. I always feel ignored.
7904,"Oh, sorry to hear that. I was under a lot of stress. What happened to you?"
7905,"Oh no, sorry hope it wasn't a snake. My hound dog is alwayd barking."
7906,"Yah, lost my job and trying to find a new one."
7907,"Oh my, that is along time. Did you feel nostalgic? "
7908,"I see, you should rekindle your friendship."
7909,I know that feeling! Maturity I suppose
7910,Its that feeling you have to live with for now.. Lol!
7911,"Why, what did you do, to feel like that?"
7912,Are you planning to make up for it?
7913,You are so lucky to have such caring sister
7914,I hope you can reciprocate by sending her a birthday message  when it's time for it so she knows you care for her 
7915,I'm really sorry to hear that. How long did you have it for?
7916,That's really tough right now. I hope you're doing something fun to keep yourself occupied.
7917,I really hope you are alright. Did they catch him?
7918,Do you at least remember how he looks?
7919,Are't you afraid to catch the fever?
7920,"Good for you, I hope your sister gets well too."
7921,What do you mean they stepped up but you still had the title. Wouldn't they be the ones with that?
7922,Oh cool. Well I'm happy for you guys
7923,oh what were they doing to you
7924,"oh , elderly people are little tough to understand "
7925,yeah thats very nice to apologize to elderly people 
7926,oh wow.. where did you all go?
7927,that was so great of your friend
7928,"Aww, I'm sorry. It  sure would solve a lot of problems, wouldn't it?"
7929,What's the first thing you would do if you won a few million?
7930,"oh wow, you should have known better"
7931,try harder next time and im sure you will do better!
7932,"i agree, I love Fridays, Did you have any plans?"
7933,Sounds like a great plan. Also a great way to get diabetes! 
7934,why arent you taking a vacation with them?
7935,perhaps you could invite someone over to your place and watch a cool movie with them over a pizza?
7936,Really?
7937,5 what?
7938,I would like that much money!
7939,What business?
7940,Did you have a back up plan?
7941,"Well, now you that such is life, it makes plans for you."
7942,"I agree, I dislike Tuesdays because they are so far from Friday!"
7943,I would have been too. You should have just slept all day!
7944,was it a bear?
7945,"nice, did you beat him up?"
7946,Oh yes. I love that show I can relate to real life families.
7947,"Yes, I saw him. Very blessed and talented man."
7948,a better school?
7949,oh that stinks
7950,what are you looking forward to?
7951,"That's a great feeling, I agree! I rarely get a day where I just stay home"
7952,what did?
7953,oh no! was the argument bad? are you still friends
7954,I can not even imagine one hour!
7955,I like to be lazy as much as I can.
7956,"Sorry about that.I know how it feels,especially with the family concerns"
7957,"Please never stay idle ,fix yourself anywhere, I mean somewhere"
7958,Oh wow that is terrible I hope you recover everything that was taken from you
7959,I completely understand I have had my car broken into a few times and had objects that held value and were sentimental to me as well
7960,Good luck! Have you studied for it? Do you feel prepared?
7961,Don't be paranoid. That just upsets you. Try to think positivley.
7962,That sounds aggravating. Did you say anything to her?
7963,"Thats okay, you should call the police next time."
7964,"Yeah, Tuesday is just the beginning of the week and more to go. Is that why?"
7965,So true
7966,It always feels exciting to do something big at work. It always feels good to feel like you are making progress in your career. 
7967,"Also, maybe this is something you can put on your resume and it will look good in the future. "
7968,Sorry about that. You should try again and stay confident. The most important is to try.
7969,Good. Stay focus and you will have success. We always learn something in our good and bad experiences.
7970,Congratulations. Are you going by yourself? 
7971,Have fun you two!
7972,"Eww, that must have so disgusting. You should report this to the FDA."
7973,"Oh I see, try and avoid expired food next time!"
7974,Oh?  Where is she going?
7975,Aww man!  That is a long time to be without your wife.  I bet you're going to miss her :(
7976,"Oh, no I hope you found him and he is ok."
7977,Do you know where he went
7978,time to lay the smack down
7979,yea i can believe it.. but it makes you feel better!
7980,"what...? you were in the toilet? and they were trying to get in? whut? i am so confused, why would they do that?"
7981,"that is really weird, I would be so stunned if that was happening to me, and its not like theres only one toilet on a plane usually so wtf. was she still there when you got out?"
7982,Oh I'm sorry. Have you tried to talk to people?
7983,"You can try again to reach out to people. Otherwise, remember that it is only temporary... soon you will be in a different class with more opportunities to make friends.  "
7984,"Nice, it is always to good to celebrate your birthday in a fancy way every few years!"
7985,That is quite interesting. I hope your day went very well!
7986,That is gracious of you. I haven't done that in awhile.
7987,I agree
7988,Had you lent someone some money?

7998,Fun
7999,That's really great that you have someone to take them out of the house and help out!
8000,"Becoming a parent is funny, I used to so look forward to summers. Now, even though its nice to have time with them it adds new challenges."
8001,That is wonderful to have a personal touch for your wedding. It makes it all the more special. 
8002,That's great that you had a backup plan for that. It sounds like it was great and I bet everyone was very impressed!
8003,oh happy for you buddy

8005,"I'm sorry, how does that make you feel?"
8006,"Well, you can always try to get a promotion next time! "
8007,"No, Congratulation. Do you have something planned today?"
8008,That is nice.
8009,oh what really went wrong
8010,yeah its problematic in such kind of job interviews
8011,Are you talking about a co-worker of yours?
8012,Did you have a conversation about not meeting deadlines?
8013,Ok
8014,What exactly did you do for the school year book?
8015,That is wonderful. I use to love English classes in college.
8016,Its great when family get together. Do you do that on special occasions only?
8017,Exactly. You must feel very happy when that happens.
8018,Then you need to take a break 
8019,"Nice, is that within your skill set?"
8020,That's fantastic.

8027,he seems like a terrible guy
8028,"well, we all have that moment in our days.. dont worry"
8029,"true.. but it is for their own good only, discipline would help them moving forward"
8030,thats is really nice of you as a friend
8031,"she wont, good deeds arent punished"
8032,You can still turn it in! Just drop it off to the police or the people in charge at the subway. 
8033,I would feel bad to but save up some cash put it back and bring it back. you got this. 
8034,That is nice. You don't go anymore in family?
8035,Sorry to hear that. It is good a idea.
8036,very true.. do you live alone now?
8037,"i feel you.. but look on the bright side, it makes the moments being together far more special"
8038,oh damn.. it is kind of funny yes
8039,lol.. i guess that would be a cool story to tell you child when she grows up huh?
8040,I am sorry to hear that.  Do you have any meds that could help relieve the pain?
8041,Maybe you should rethink going to the dentist if you're in so much pain.
8042,"Oh, how did you like it?"
8043,"I'll have to check it out, thanks for the rec! I've been meaning to add more things to my ""must watch"" list."
8044,"oh wow I really hate snakes, I would've freaked out! What did you do?"

8047,glad it worked out.
8048,hrmmm wonder if its a ghost or a rodent?
8049,oh wow.. that is strange
8050,"lol, you are so lucky to have such a sweet brother. what do you buy him in return?"
8051,"haha.. thats hilarious, i thought he was spoiling you!"
8052,"Oh no, have you found him yet? "
8053,"I really hope so that sucks. Put out some dog food, some water, maybe one of his favorite toys. "
8054,wow thats a nice little drive!
8055,oh wow i would think it would take longer
8056,awesome! how much did you get?
8057,thats too good.. congrats!
8058,What!? My god sounds like a horror movie. You better move. 
8059,"I would have moved that same night, and probably changed my identity thats terrifying! "
8060,"Did you get there on time? I do the same thing, I like to be prepared for any traffic that could pop up."
8061,Something always comes up whenever you need to be somewhere! That's how life works!
8062,oh i see.. did you have any programs planned?
8063,sorry to hear that buddy
8064,"oh no, were you hurt?"
8065,"true that, stay safe!"
8066,"Oh, what kind is it?"
8067,"I've never owned a jeep, are they nice?"
8068,Why not? Whats going on? 
8069,Happens to the best of us we are only human. Dont take it in a bad way im sure its been real nice being alone. 
8070,oh damn.. what was it?
8071,i hope the cops took care of it
8072,"Oh god, how so what happened? "
8073,Sounds like florida ugh 
8074,Wow you too! It's crazy how many bad drivers there are.
8075,Well I'm glad you weren't hurt.
8076,"Yikes, that's a tough place to be in. She's very forward for asking something like that too."
8077,"They do and you never know what could happen, let's say you guys get into a fight and then she trashes your house! Not a good outcome!"
8078,"That sucks! I cant save money at all I always overspend even just for groceries. I hope you can save up atleast al ittle money and take like a ""daycation"" ! "
8079,"Im always living on a budget so even if you could atleast treat yourself for a day, or 1 night then do it! You deserve it I am sure you are working hard. "
8080,That's pretty awesome. I have never been that far!
8081,Mexico. I went to cozumel once
8082,"Sometimes it can be hard to find the right one at the right price, did you find one?"
8083,"That is awesome, I'm glad you were able to find one. How big is the TV?"
8084,yeah that kid were more lovely and attractive. i was love kids
8085,oh thats nice 
8086,Same as me! Everyone is always shocked to know that
8087,"Well, truth be told I've never gotten one ever which is even more rare. But good on your partner, really. That's hard to do!"
8088,Are you going to have any other roommate or you will be living alone?
8089,Maybe you can post an ad on Craigslist. That way many will see and be interested 
8090,Did the check end up hitting in time?
8091,I would be too. ugh that sucks! 
8092,Oh no. That has happened to me before. 
8093,That is a long tedious process too. You have to have one thing to get the other and they make you run around and get more things. ugh
8094,How many does she have? 
8095,"That is a lot wow, she must really love watching tv atleast it gives her something to do tho! "
8096,That's great. You both must be excited
8097,Are you moving to a better home?
8098,That can be nerve wrecking. How did you do?
8099,What kind of grade did you get?
8100,That's great. Do you visit the casino often?
8101,Yeah I don't have the best luck in casinos either.
8102,"Oh dear! Did you get sprayed? That would frighten me too, especially at night."
8103,Well that's a relief! I'm glad neither of you got sprayed.
8104,wow nice
8105,oh its unfair and really hurts
8106,iam gonna end chant now
8107,Oh wow! how was that? I have never had Taco Bell breakfast.
8108,Oh really? I can understand. I usually regret eating Taco Bell. Especially after the digestive process.
8109,Oh wow! That is a bold move! Which state did you move to/from?
8110,That is awesome. I have considered moving from Missouri down to either Lower Alabama or Florida. 
8111,That's incredible! I would have never expected him to leave Cleveland.
8112,"Yeah we will see, are you a big basketball fan?"

8121,How do you feel about New England?
8122,i love all the cardinals in the woods behind my house
8123,i dont want them to suffer either
8124,why did it upset you?
8125,What kind of plans did you have going on?

8127,Good because he's no good for you. You deserve better.
8128,I would love that too lol! What would you do if you won?
8129,Be careful with flying over the ocean! It's a bit scary
8130,its a gift and a curse as they say
8131,thats very true
8132,That's great! How exciting!
8133,Yeah I know what you mean. It probably feels like you're losing a friend.
8134,Wow! Where did they go?
8135,Aw. You miss her. That's sweet. My daughter won't leave the house so I can miss her lol
8136,"thats great, are you usually not able to?"
8137,i understand how that goes
8138,I would be mad too. What happened?
8139,How long before you get what is owed to you?
8140,for your job or mental health?
8141,hope it turns out well for you
8142,Don't say that. There is somebody for every single person on this earth.
8143,Don't force it. They usually come around when your not looking.
8144,thats cool.. take any pics?
8145,"Nice, did you ace it"
8146,I hope you weren't smoking any weed 
8147,What exactly do you mean? Did you expect them to be taken away from him?
8148,"Oh dear, I hope everything works out."
8149,What kind of party?
8150,A close friend? What kind of decorations did he get?
8151,set an alarm on your phone
8152,thanks
8153,What happens on saturday?
8154,"Lol, nice"
8155,That's not good at all
8156,Can't you just leave food out? Or set an alarm on your phone?
8157,That sucks
8158,Save up some money for the salon then
8159,why what was the reason
8160,oh that good to hear. nice human beings
8161,yes i do
8162,cause you ran out of candles?
8163,Was it a birthday party?
8164,You probably should feel really bad. Was it a kid's birthday?
8165,Cute? Oh my word
8166,I have never seen a skunk outside before. I'm glad too
8167,Like penguns? that might be cute to see.
8168,It's nice to see someone who loves school! What are you studying?
8169,Lol! Oh my goodness. So you are going to be a police officer or a lawyer?
8170,Oh I am sorry to hear that. Are you normally frightened to go home alone?
8171,"Do you have an alarm system. My wife and I have one, and it automatically texts me if I am away from home and the alarm goes off. "
8172,That is amazing. It is so nice to have someone to share your life with. How long have y'all been together?
8173,Wow! I have been married for a little over 2 years. What is the secret to a long lasting marriage?
8174,Oh I have felt that way before. When did you graduate?
8175,"I can totally understand that. I was so excited to get out into the 'real' world. I did one enlistment in the military after high school, and now I am in college. Rude awakening after high school!"
8176,I hear you! What happened?
8177,That's not good. I hope you both can communicate about it in a respectful way.
8178,why any strange things do you found on your neighbour

8184,oh its really bad to hear
8185,why what happaned?
8186,Oh that's okay! I am as well. Sometimes I trip for no reason whatsoever.
8187,That happens to me often. I also trip walking up the stairs quite often. It can be quite embarrassing!
8188,"Me too, its the only place I get to get away from my wife's constant nagging."
8189,It's no problem. My work comfort's me just like yours does.
8190,That's great! It is so important to be content in life.
8191,What do you do for a living? Does that contribute to your happiness?
8192,Oh wow! Congratulations! I also recently applied for grad school to study Computer Science (seriously). What are you wanting to study?
8193,"That is very cool! I don't know about you, but I have been stressed out about the whole process."
8194,"That's great that you love your job, that is really important!"
8195,That is a powerful type of position.
8196,That sounds exciting!  Where are you going?
8197,I've had a lot of friends go there.  What are your specific plans while you're away?
8198,what breed is he?
8199,"thats cute, i bet hes a great dog"
8200,I love Mexican food! How was it?
8201,That sounds so good. 
8202,That is great. I love dogs. Do you have any family 
8203,Yay! That is great. Where are you going for vacation?
8204,Wow! That's exciting! Was it what you were looking for?
8205,That's great. Congrats on your home purchase!
8206,"That is scary! I've never flown before, the only time I have ever been on a plane was when I went skydiving."
8207,I also enjoy traveling!
8208,did you intervene?
8209,that is awful
8210,"That does not sound good to me, either. I cannot stand pineapple!"
8211,I think it is too acidic for me.
8212,It sounds like you have a fulfilling job. That's great
8213,It's so refreshing to hear someone who really loves what they do.
8214,congratulations!
8215,i am really happy for you
8216,That's awesome! What is the name of the book?
8217,That's great. I produce audio and I have an album coming out by the end of the summer! Tell her to keep it up!
8218,"Oh wow! That must be quite nerve-wracking, although I am sure that you will do great! What are you planning to study?"
8219,Oh wow! Do you want to work in schools?
8220,"It is eerie, isn't it. You must have felt quite strange. Hope your poor doggie is ok!"
8221,That must've been terrifying for you. It's amazing how we can hear every little thing around us when we're alone!
8222,That's great! You must feel so accomplished! What math class are you taking?
8223,I can understand that! Math has never been my strongest subject. 
8224,that is great! family is the best
8225,i can imagine
8226,That was so nice of him. He sounds very caring.
8227,You are very lucky!
8228,I am sure you will get used to them
8229,"That is a challenge, but thats not a bad thing"
8230,Oh man I am so sorry.  Had she had the dog for a long time?
8231,That is so sad.  My dog had congestive heart failure and died so I know how sad that can be
8232,"Although you felt bad, I am sure your friend would understand. "
8233,That is good. Everyone gets busy sometimes.
8234,That does sound fun
8235,I am sure there will be none of those there
8236,I am so sorry to hear that. Dealing with the loss of a loved one is always difficult but feeling alone in the grief must be so much worse. I hope that you are feeling less alone now.
8237,I am sure that it did. Were you very close with your father?
8238,"Oh YAY congrats! You should be proud of yourself, that's a good accomplishment"
8239,"Yeah, people get comfortable even if they don't like it. It's sometimes good to try something new."
8240,I did not understand the number 4
8241,Well ... I hope you like it and above all that you study something amazing
8242,"It's something we've all done, dont feel bad. Would he have gotten mad?"
8243,"If you dont mind me asking, where was it that you pretended to be?"
8244,"Ya we've all been there lol. Just be careful and all that, you'll be fine."
8245,"Oh wow, what aspect of his presidency is bothering you?"
8246,I can understand why that upsets you. Are you a Hillary Clinton supporter?
8247,Did you study hard for it?
8248,That's awesome! Are you going to celebrate now or wait until the grades come in?
8249,Mer to
8250,"yes, it it's.It's like a time machine."
8251,"I am sorry, what are you sad about"
8252,I have been there. I guess just remember the good times
8253,That's awesome! Congratulations! Are you in college?
8254,That is a wonderful memory. What school did you attend?
8255,That's great! Are you in school or teaching?
8256,"That's awesome! I am currently in college myself. I actually just finished two summer courses today. Not going to lie though, I could use a bit of a break before the fall semester begins."
8257,Oh wow! I am sure that you did great! Did you just finish high school?
8258,"I can relate to that. I went into the military after high school, and I am currently in college. It was a bit overwhelming getting back into the state of mind required for school, but it is all worth it! What school are you hoping to attend?"
8259,It's hard to make this decision ... I'm sorry ... What's your pet's name?
8260,Omar sure will have some new owners who will love it
8261,Why don't you see them anymore?
8262,"Aww, the best thing you can do is keep them alive through your memories."
8263,"Oh wow, are you excited"
8264,I remember that feeling myself back on my first day of college
8265,The first years is the best
8266,Congratulations! That is exciting
8267,but it's over now :) what kind of car?
8268,that's a good car 
8269,I bet that was pretty awkward.
8270,Did the woman say anything to you?
8271,Oh no what did you take?
8272,Did you tell him about it at least?
8273,I love surprises.  What was it?
8274,Nice!  Where did he take you?
8275,Oh wow! Did it work?
8276,I bet you felt really bad. Did you end up telling her the truth?
8277,I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anyone who's there to help her?
8278,That was nice of you.  My parents did the same with my grandparents.  She's very fortunate to have you.
8279,I am sorry to hear; drunk people can make a situation quite difficult to deal with. Have you been friends for long?
8280,I can understand that. You sound like a good friend.
8281,"Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. Does your mom know?"
8282,I am so sorry that your family is going through this horrible time. Is your dad unwilling to end the affair?
8283,I can understand your apprehension. Have you ever served on jury duty before?
8284,I have never served on jury duty either. The closest thing that I have experienced was serving as a guard during a military court martial.
8285,What did she accomplish?
8286,WOW... that is a biggie!
8287,Good for you.You are a person with morals.
8288,"We all have thinking that sometimes, but acting is the wrong thing to do."
8289,"Oh mine too, he is 12 and lost eye sight"
8290,"Wow, 15 cant do nothing but love them"
8291,were you qualified ?
8292,its all apart of life sometimes
8293,That was really lucky! And also very nice of your sister. What'd you do with the case?
8294,That's really great. Are the trees really tall where you live?
8295,That's terrible! Did he at least live a good life?
8296,Oh man! Be sure to give em a proper sendoff. 
8297,I don't think having designer brand is all that great.
8298,Why does being cool matter though? Wouldn't you rather just be yourself?
8299,Oh yeah.. what happened?
8300,That is the worst.. I've had that happen to me before!
8301,It is nice to have your own place. Think about just being able to do whatever you want. You can just punch your walls if you want.
8302,It's ok just think about it this way. You don't have to pay property taxes or even be worried about your lawn.
8303,do you live in the midwest
8304,do you have an emergency shelter in your basement ?
8305,"I hate that, did you ask them to stop"
8306,"That isnt good, sorry"
8307,That's fantastic! Senior year can be such a fun experience! I hope that she enjoys it. Is she going to take a senior trip?
8308,That sounds exciting! I went on my first cruise in March; we had a blast!
8309,"Oh wow, he must be proud of himself!"
8310,"That is some feat, I wish I could do that!"
8311,That would really upset me! How are you going to get to work?
8312,Can you take an uber?
8313,"It can be scary, my sister's in-laws' house got struck by lightning recently."
8314,"I think so, not sure how the house is."
8315,I am sure you will be okay
8316,I am glad it wasnt
8317,That is tough.  Does he help you study too??
8318,Then why do you think he gets better grades?
8319,Did you try watching movies or playing video games?
8320,Did you have a great Christmas then?
8321,Holidays are always a nice time to get together. 
8322,Sometimes being alone can be a good thing though
8323,Well I am sure it was a good experience
8324,Oh that is pretty neat. Who is your favorite band anyway?
8325,"Oh I like them too. I like that song I think it is called ""Change"". It is so good."
8326,That would be discouraging.  Did you make new friends?
8327,That's no fun. Hopefully you got some stuff done around the house then.
8328,Oh no.. why what happened?
8329,Thats awesome!  I am tired too I had to be up early today.
8330,Oh! that is pretty nice to come home too.
8331,You better keep him sounds like a keeper.
8332,thats so great! i love my dad too
8333,thats really awesome
8334,Oh man I bet that is a very difficult test. I can't believe how many instruments are in a cockpit!
8335,What a bummer. At least now you know what you need to study for when you take the exam again!
8336,That's unfortunate.  Did the people you work with by any chance surprise you?  Please say yes!
8337,Blow out them candles and make a wish!
8338,Congrats!  What school?
8339,How long must you attend school?
8340,I bet that was fun
8341,That will be fun
8342,That is awesome. Was it high school or college?
8343,Oh cool I bet he had to work really hard to get his degree. I am sure he appreciated your support.
8344,I have those kinds of feelings as well. I think memories are a good thing though
8345,"I can understand that for sure, just remember the good ones"
8346,That sounds really nice!  Did you enjoy yourself and relax?
8347,It is a good feeling when you get to just relax and feel laid back.
8348,"Ha, that will be fun though"
8349,"Ha, I bet it will be fine"
8350,That must have felt sort of defeating.  There is still hope if there isn't a ring on her finger!
8351,"Try not to feel that way.  If it was meant to be, it would have happened.  There are plenty of other fish in the sea!"
8352,Oh wow that is awesome. I remember when those came out. Everyone wanted to have one!
8353,It's crazy how many toys they have now. Disney is really pushing the merchandise out!
8354,How'd he do that?
8355,"Sounds like a mess, how much did it cost to replace?"
8356,Oh that's not good! What happened?
8357,That's always a pain! It can take forever but never lasts long enough
8358,"Man, that is so sad.  I don't know what I would do if my dog ran away!  Did you ever find him?"
8359,That's awesome!  I love a happy ending!
8360,"Yeah those guys sure charge a lot. They know they are needed for emergencies, hah!"
8361,That is a trade that can get very messy. I respect guys that get arm-deep in sewage lol!
8362,Is it your birthday?
8363,I hope a nice surprise.
8364,That's always hard to deal with. What did he do?
8365,I'm sorry he did that to you. Maybe it was just a misunderstanding.
8366,"I bet you will do well, sounds attentve"
8367,"Way to, it really pays off to study, and a CPA thats impressive"
8368,How sad ... you must be desolate
8369,There are other cats that need help
8370,im sorry to hear that. no chance of working it out?
8371,im sorry to hear that
8372,did you give them the finger ?
8373,i have come across that many times and just shake my head
8374,That must have been really scary. Maybe you like cats instead?
8375,Oh I see. Did you get tested to see if they had any diseases? Strays sometimes have rabies.
8376,"Wow, thank goodness you didnt hit it, for youre sake and the deer"
8377,"That can happen, Ive seen deer walk across a highway"
8378,"Oh my goodness, that is terrible.  They don't have insurance?"
8379,I was just about to mention that you should be careful that its not a scam of some sort.
8380,Oh my. That would really tick me off. In my state they will lose their license for that.
8381,Well I hope your insurance company sues them. They should really be more responsible.
8382,in a good way or bad way?
8383,a lot of people are suprised by the GDP
8384,"Whoa, that is a good neighbor. I hope you return the favor some time!"
8385,Dang. I bet there is a great story of how it got there!
8386,Dang. Did she practice a lot leading up to the recital?
8387,Wow! Maybe I should start taking some piano lessons and go to a recital of my own.
8388,Oh wow. Do you think you are going to go?
8389,That's pretty neat. Where is it at?
8390,That sucks!  Bowling is definitely a hang out with friends kind of sport 
8391,You should join a league and meet some friends with similar interests.
8392,That's odd. Were they laughing about you?
8393,Oh wow. You always have to be on the look out for the rogue rip in the pants! That's what got my uncle late in life. RIP in peace.
8394,Whoa I hope you guys have a great honeymoon. Make sure to treat your fiancee right!
8395,Well as long as you have a safe word you should be OK. You also may want to buy some life insurance.
8396,what do you mean by 5?
8397,Ha Ha!  Thats ok.  Ugg...that had to be annoying.  Is he just a puppy
8398,what a joy ... as it is called
8399,Thank God ... that's good
8400,That's awful!
8401,"I would have been angry too, is it cleanable?"
8402,That's terrible! How did it feel when it happened? Were you mad?
8403,I would be too. Hopefully you channeled your rage to let him know who is king of the road.
8404,It is very nice. Where would you go first with your new car?
8405,Nice
8406,That's terrible. Are you guys still friends?
8407,That's so sad. Perhaps you should buy him a cake and beg for his forgiveness.
8408,That sounds so relaxing.  What book did you read?
8409,ha ha ha.  Its a good book for sure!
8410,That's too bad. What was supposed to be coming in the mail?
8411,Well that's good. I hope whatever it is you're waiting for improves your life.
8412,Did he do any damage?
8413,Is the sword in one piece?
8414,How is the food usually?
8415,Dim Sum specifically
8416,What kind of coffee will you get?
8417,Are the coffees there expensive?
8418,I agree with you. I think everything will be fine in the end.
8419,It's good to see that you have a positive attitude about it like me.
8420,That is very nice thing to do.
8421,I understand. You are over the water. Nothing bad could happened.
8422,What was the document?
8423,I would imagine he'd be pretty upset
8424,How did you feel?
8425,What kind of car was it?
8426,I had a similar experience the other day at the gas station. It's terrible when that stuff happens.
8427,Yeah but people are only amused because something they fear is happening to someone else. Those people don't matter and it's happened to everyone
8428,oh. was it cancelled?
8429,Just ask him. Or you can make the plans
8430,Oh? Did you have fun?
8431,"Ah, I've never really been into big TVs. I have a tiny one that's good enough for me!"
8432,Has he been needy?
8433,How long do you think it'll take for him to recover?
8434,"It happens, sounds like you need to remove all the bad food from your home"
8435,Maybe ask a friend to help keep you in check
8436,Just kidding. There is some products that you can use to avoid those bad experience.
8437,Are they against Trump?
8438,"Well, I guess Canada doesn't like to take any shit from Trump"
8439,How many?
8440,What are the books about? 
8441,Which wireless service provider do you have?
8442,I heard they have really cheap plans and you don't get locked into a shitty contract like other providers.
8443,That sucks. I hate when my games are interrupted for any reason.
8444,Oh no. You should invest in something new.
8445,Don't let your ex manipulate you!
8446,Tell him to f&^% off!
8447,No rage quitting?
8448,What do you play. I just preordered Call of Duty BO4
8449,I'm gonna look that up
8450,What kind of place is it?
8451,What was your fav dish there?
8452,That is great! You must be so proud!
8453,That is nice that you are so supportive of her.
8454,I bet that brings back a lot of great memories! Is the food good?
8455,What type of food do they serve?
8456,Where on your chest?
8457,Hopefully it works out for you
8458,"Wow, she can already drive?"
8459,She sounds like a great babysitter
8460,"Like, What are your weaknesses?"
8461,You gonna get the job!
8462,Do you not have them anymore?
8463,I'm sorry to hear that
8464,Well she is in a better place.
8465,Ddi you take classes or something?
8466,I think I have a good eye too.
8467,My mom does that for a living. I could probably be good at it.
8468,You and me both.
8469,What about a soccer team?
8470,That must save you some time.
8471,One step at a time.
8472,What kind of job does he have in the military?
8473,How long has he been there?
8474,"Me too, do you like Trump?"
8475,"I love how direct he is, he definitely one of the best presidents in recent years."
8476,"I saw the trailer, looks good."
8477,I saw her fight once. She kicked butt.
8478,I bet that is a great feeling
8479,Well at least things are starting to look positive for you!
8480,I couldn't get into that game.
8481,I tried to play it. I couldnt get into battlefield either. Maps too huge?
8482,Me either I love adventure movies!
8483,Me too! I love them.
8484,"Wow, that is impressive."
8485,What will you study?
8486,It's nice to know there are faithful people still out there. Keep it up!
8487,That must mean you really do love and care about her.
8488,You must see them a lot.
8489,At least you can talk on the phone.
8490,I love the fall.
8491,I used to love the piles of leaves when I was younger. Raking is no fun now.
8492,"Nice, whats the reason?"
8493,Will you not go out then?
8494,"Oh god, you didn't get attacked, did you?!"
8495,Oh wow. I would have freaked out
8496,Well at least you are okay now.
8497,I love cruises. Where are you guys headed to on the cruise?
8498,"Nice! I think I went to Cozumel, Mexico with my family in like 2013? It was on the Carnival Imagination cruise, it was awesome!"
8499,I would be so mad. I am terrified of snakes.
8500,When I was a kid I used to have nightmares that I was on a bridge in a car and the whole car and bridge were covered in snakes. It was awful.
8501,I just read about that today.  Do you think he will be ready for it?
8502,He definitely is cool to watch.
8503,What did they call about?
8504,Wow that is a long time ago.
8505,That's no good.
8506,People aren't tolerating that type of behavior anymore. She had better watch it.
8507,Are you the mother or father? Time flies so fast..
8508,I bet she is going to be a great person when she is older
8509,I bet you are super jealous!
8510,She was probably disappointed at you.
8511,Are you upset about this? I'd try meeting hr in person
8512,Should have grabbed the gun.
8513,I would have shot that thing dead and then burned it. Then ate it for dinner.
8514,That is good to hear. Disabilities are never easy for people.
8515,Nothing upsets me more than people getting handicapped plates and not being handicapped.
8516,Maybe he should give you a raise so you can stay.
8517,Well you have to think about yourself.
8518,Really? Which one was it? 
8519,Was that in the United States or somewhere else? I used to love All My Children and General Hospital. 
8520,Sounds like fun! I wonder if you could find old episodes online now. 
8521,"Oh, cool! Any names I might know?"
8522,I was just talking about this with my friend. They are getting too old
8523,i know right.
8524,Did you have plans to pick up something special?
8525,I know that was probably embarrassing then but can you at least laugh about it now?
8526,Are you making some good progress?
8527,"You must be quite proud, how much can you lift?"
8528,I can't imagine my house on fire. That's I got home insurance!
8529,I hope you didn't lose too much.
8530,"Yeah, the crime rate has steadily been rising. Not good."
8531,I miss the good ol' days too!
8532,That is awesome. I bet she worked really hard to get that promotion. Good for her.
8533,"Cool, I hope she continues to be successful. It's good you are encouraging her!"
8534,"It feels nostalgic, what did you like most about that time period?"
8535,"Must've been nice, being so free and enjoying your time."
8536,"Yes, I didn't like it at all. I'm not into jump scares."
8537,"Yeah, no thank you for me."
8538,Was there any reason why?
8539,"That's awesome, I've never had good neighbors so I'm pretty jealous of you!"
8540,I call my sister that all the time. 
8541,OH. I'm sorry. We do that to each other. I  didn't know she hurt your feelings.
8542,Thats Sucks I download games so I don't have that problem
8543,I used to have that problem too. Downloading would take days. Technology saved me there.
8544,Well as long as they're good people than it shouldn't be that bad. 
8545,What did she do?
8546,Have you told her not to do that?
8547,IT went by fast.
8548,That sucks. Everyone deserves a vacay.
8549,"Oh no, that's the worst to spend time cooking something and then taking a bite and it's awful."
8550,I've done it before so I feel your pain.
8551,Nice! Are you going scuba divng?
8552,"Ah, gotcha. Sounds delicious!"
8553,What did you carry for her?
8554,"You're so sweet for doing that, did she thank you?"
8555,What ahappened to the vase?
8556,People still play with those?
8557,Who did she blame?
8558,Well if the cat didn't tell the truth he didn't mind atking the fall.
8559,Hey. It happened to me. It could happen to you too!
8560,Have you ever put butter in your noodles. It elevates them lol
8561,I've never used cheese. Learn something new every day.
8562,"You know, thinking about it. I don't think I've ever had a honey bun..."
8563,"Wow, that sucks. I bet you are so disappointed..."
8564,What kind of list is that? Are you bringing them some Christmas cookies?
8565,Oh so maybe you will leave some coal on their doorstep instead. They should be more considerate.
8566,Ok. That's kinda neat.
8567,Oh I know how that feels.
8568,Aww that's sweet! How old are your kids? 
8569,Yeah I like to have pictures of my loved ones and pets and such at work. It really helps when I'm having a rough day.
8570,Oh no. I would have screamed.
8571,That's nice. No police were involved?
8572,Well at least you're safe.
8573,That's nice.
8574,Aw. No one cooks for me :(
8575,I'm sorry to hear that. What's holding you back? 
8576,You'll get there one day!
8577,Just keep working at it. 
8578,"Wow, the last one? How many seasons have they made?"
8579,I need to watch that show in my free time. EVeryone I know talks about that show constantly!
8580,did you get an A?
8581,Come clean and take an F then
8582,Me too. I can focus on myself for a while
8583,I feel the same way.
8584,At least you are thinking back on it and doing some self-reflecting. 
8585,That's so mean. I bet he just wanted to say good morning to you.
8586,Did you buy a new battery?
8587,"Yeah, I really liked those hunting trophies he got. We should be allowed to kill any animals we see!"
8588,Oh I was thinking of his son. I don't know much about the Donald besides the Twitter stuff.
8589,"No, that's a little too expensive for me."
8590,"It's snails, isn't it? Why would anyone want to eat that is beyond me."
8591,That is terrible. What was it for?
8592,Now That's a no no. Kill him
8593,Oh wow. I have no advice there.
8594,Maybe you should calming ask about it. 
8595,What are you planning on buying? 
8596,"You self-entitled brat! Just kidding, your mother loves you"
8597,Storms? Why?
8598,Everything closes when we get an inch of snow in the south. 
8599,What is this weekend?
8600,Have you met them before?
8601,I am waiting for Halloween. Its my favorite.
8602,Lol. I do themes with me and my kids. Then I eat all of their candy
8603,That's awesome. You guys sound very close!
8604,That is so messed up lol
8605,Oh yeah? I heard the circus had to close recently. What is your favorite part?
8606,Elephants are pretty cool. I wonder if they actually like peanuts?
8607,Did you clean it again?
8608,Well that a good thing to study too
8609,Im in school now for psychology. ITs so boring
8610,What do you miss most about being a kid?
8611,Just relaxing and playing?
8612,How old will you be?
8613,Maybe they will party at your house after.
8614,They did? I've never seen a baseball game lol
8615,There are some real die har fans I miaght have to check it out
8616,I don't believe you.
8617,How did you get the opportunity to meet him?
8618,What will be lit?
8619,That sounds boring.
8620,That is scary! As a 26 year old I cannot imagine actually having kids at this age. I'd be running around like a chicken
8621,"That's rough! I'm glad you're ok now (I hope), but that must have been really traumatic "
8622,Oh no!  Did you have a cell phone or did anyone come out to help you?  I literally hate car problems.
8623,Oh great!  I do not have that kind of knowledge at all - maybe you could come with me on the next road trip - LOL!!  
8624,What kind did they get?
8625,Are you a bit jealous?
8626,It's sad actually. But be happy she become independent.
8627,"Yeah, let her free."
8628,That's crazy! I hope to propose one day. Congratulations!
8629,That's great! Disney is a wonderful place to go. I actually live near The Magic Kingdom!
8630,"Ugh, that is so annoying. Did you say anything?"
8631,"Good, maybe he'll learn not to be a jerk next time."
8632,Did you try taken him to a specialist to help with that?
8633,Did you try closing your room?
8634,"Rainy days are boring, but I do like the sound of them. It's calming in a way"
8635,"Yea, it is better in moderation. That's true"
8636,Who?
8637,That's terrifying. I refuse to swim in the ocean. Too scary.
8638,Glad you are both safe.
8639,"Well, at least you followed the law and didn't end up running a red light."
8640,"Yes, Better safe than sorry I guess."
8641,"no , but i heard about it in commercials "
8642,"i will try on do this asap , dude yesterday i forgot to pay some money i owed my friend, i felt kinda of ashamed "
8643,"i got payed , went shopping ate dinner, then my friend messaged me asking for his money .... i had totally forgot about this"
8644,"Well, maybe your friend will understand."
8645,I know how you feel.
8646,"Yeah, kids grow up so fast!"
8647,That makes me mad
8648,Some people should be more considerate
8649,Where did you move to?
8650,Im sorry.. I moved once from MD to FL so I know how you feel being without your peeps.
8651,Oh. That's kind of exciting though
8652,"Well be yourself. If it doesnt work out, think of it as practice!"
8653,Hey great! What did you eat?
8654,It is good to just treat yourself sometimes!
8655,Oh don't feel bad! We need to treat ourselves sometimes!
8656,Thats terrible.
8657,I have heard of that. 
8658,I'm so sorry for your loss.
8659,"Oh, I remember those days."
8660,Are you going to punish them for it?
8661,I have had that happen a few times.
8662,Why is he 2 now?
8663,It won't last much longer.  Before you know it he will be grown up and married.
8664,By yourself?
8665,Well you should enjoy it
8666,That sounds nice.  What did you get?
8667,That is terrible.  I am so sorry
8668,I wish my family lived close. You are lucky
8669,We see each other once a year.
8670,How so? Just used to the way things are?
8671,"Oh no, are there things you could do outside of your comfort zone? Things you never considered before?"
8672,That's great. I hope she likes the new position.
8673,Why are you so nervous?
8674,"Okay, I totally understand your feelings."
8675,That's great. What is he doing now?
8676,That's even more awesome. I hope he does well.
8677,I do that a lot. 
8678,Aint that the truth!
8679,thats cool that you have one every year.
8680,That could be fun!
8681,That's great. I've never gotten a bonuse at work.
8682,I just went on a vaction with my kids. Its was so relaxing. Have fun
8683,Are you tired?
8684,I understand. Taking some rest is important.
8685,Did you get caught?
8686,Don't feel too bad.  Its not like the government gives you money once a year.
8687,"Oh no, is there a storm approaching?"
8688,That is a very good idea.
8689,I'm sure they're not - what makes you think that?
8690,"Perhaps next time the bill arrives, say something like, ""ok, so that's $25 each"" and take out $25 and put it on the table. They may take the hint."
8691,Congrats! That is great!
8692,That is definitely  something to be proud of.
8693,Sometimes when kids are young they don't get the importance of school
8694,That can be nerve wrecking.
8695,Do you think you did well?
8696,How far are you going?  What school?
8697,Way cool!  Congratulations!  Should be a great experience
8698,I hope you get a good grade. Were you well prepared?
8699,"So, you don't have to worry about it."
8700,"Aw, that's so sad, I hope you had fun though"
8701,"At least you had fun, too bad the friend missed out, their loss"
8702,Oh cool!  How pregnant are you?
8703,Ohhhh so you already had her!  Congratulations!
8704,That would be annoying.  How about meeting up with a friend or something?
8705,I’m sorry. What are you going to do?
8706,I like being emotional
8707,I bet.  Its probably cheaper than therapy though!
8708,Lol. I've done that before.
8709,Sometimes we don't have it. God knows.
8710,I would imagine so.  It is difficult to be away from family for long.
8711,"That would probably do the trick.  If not, video call your family to touch base more often?"
8712,Thats awesome.  Where are you wanting to go?
8713,I live near Disney.. have you ever been?
8714,That can be stressful. Is she ok?
8715,I’m so sorry to hear that. 
8716,"Wow, that rocks!"
8717,"I love winning things.  It just makes the whole day perfect, lol."
8718,That's kind of you
8719,I bet she really appreciates you
8720,When does it come out?
8721,"Wow, that sucks."
8722,That's kind of you to help her through hard times!
8723,I am sure you will do great.
8724,Lol. Are you embarrased?
8725,I don't like that either.
8726,That's no good.  Did you get anything good with it?
8727,That is something to be grateful for.
8728,MY boyfriend once said if he ever had to be in a wheelchair he wanted me to kill him. I broke up with him
8729,How old are they?
8730,It's always nice to have a balance in life
8731,I bet you are apprehensive.
8732,They sound very selfish trying to blackmail you like that. I would tell the teachers or professors asap
8733,I am very content with having no car.
8734,That can be very unhealthy for you but it's so convenient
8735,Yeah that stuff is addicting
8736,I love Tom Hardy!
8737,He is. And he is nice to look at too lol
8738,What is the dish?
8739,Maybe she can help you and guide you step by step
8740,Oh no! 
8741,You had better sleep with one eye open
8742,"Me too, I like to see them as inspiration"
8743,If you work hard enough maybe you can afford in the future!
8744,What is the class?
8745,Economics is pretty cool
8746,Are you a guy too? I bet you were envious of his looks and age hahah
8747,"Nice, I bet it was super fast!"
8748,I hate them too. I havent been on one in ten years.
8749,I would be fine if I never rode one ever again
8750,That's terrible. Won't the bank help you out?
8751,I'm sorry. That really sucks
8752,Are guitars expensive?
8753,Does she want an acoustic or electric one?
8754,What shows are you referring to?
8755,I'll need to check that out!
8756,That's terrible. Will you be able to get it back?
8757,Well at least you will get it back though.
8758,how long were u together
8759,well then maybe you're better off lol
8760,"Nice, is it expensive?"
8761,I bet you are so proud of yourself! I need to learn how to be self reliant like you!
8762,Congratulations! What's the job?
8763,Oooohhh Fancy! lol
8764,"That's nice of you, do you usually let her go out?"
8765,"My parents usually did that do. If I don't do the chores around the house, I don't get to head out"
8766,Lol. That sucks
8767,That has happened to me once or twice.
8768,"Dang, that sucks. Did you find another class that is open?"
8769,I hate it when that happens.
8770,Good luck. What is the class?
8771,Lol. Good luck anyway
8772,That is terrible.  What can you do?
8773,I am sure they will work with you.  Don't stress out.
8774,Aww. That's nice. Did you dosomething special?
8775,I wish my parents would get my kids. They are too busy having fun themselves lol
8776,"Oh no, do you know what's wrong? I hate car problems.."
8777,"Last time my car had problems, I had to spend so much money. It was awful."
8778,You should definitely first talk to your friend and clear out the concerns with him before talking to his partner
8779,"As I said, first ask your friend why is he behaving in such an unacceptable way"
8780,Are you going to tell me?
8781,You're not the only one. I am afraid of complete silence. I think I'm about to be murdered.
8782,Im almost afraid to ask
8783,hahaha I am so not one of those people.  I am too old for the technology!
8784,I know right. I was just talking about that with my friends.
8785,tell who what?
8786,"It's okay. You'll get through it, And yes you should tell her lol"
8787,I hope it didn't rain
8788,Good thing nothing bad happen! I would be so devastated if my phone got stolen like that!
8789,That sounds awesome!  What are you going to do?
8790,That is sweet!
8791,What part is that?
8792,Is it the lead role?
8793,LOL.. You crack me up.  
8794,What kinda gun do you have?
8795,Yay! What made you very happy?
8796,Oh yeah!!! I need to get my ass to a legal state to get my card too!
8797,That is no good.  What are they doing?
8798,That is annoying.  Have you thought about talking to them?
8799,7
8800,What are they pictures of?
8801,Those were the best! weren't they?
8802,THat sounds bad.  Are you alright?
8803,It sounds like you need soe distance from them
8804,Are you a helicopter parent?  Do you spin?
8805,Maybe you have went so long without hanging with your friends you forgot you had them.
8806,OH. That's terrible. 
8807,What is DiGiorno?
8808,Did you give them a home?
8809,Well that's nice. Every one deserves to be in a safe and loving home.
8810,"Would you like me to take them? :) I like kids, sometimes! I totally understand needing a break"
8811,Ah!!! Nice lol Summer went by so fast! Summer for parents now
8812,That is awesome.  I love gambling.  Was it a scratch off?  Pick 3?
8813,Its awesome... you can win 50-100 often on a 5$ scratch off..
8814,"Cool, where are you heading to?"
8815,Oh wow! I always thought kangaroos were really interesting animals!
8816,That sounds like fun! What kind of park is it?
8817,Great! Make sure to pack sunscreen. Hot here where I am
8818,That sounds terrible.  What can you do?
8819,I definitely agree you need to set up the boundaries.  Make sure you keep that up for the sake of everyone involved.
8820,I had to buy a fruit fly trap this summer as well.  But as soon as I set it up they stopped flying around.
8821,I feel your pain.. I really do!
8822,"Oh lord, I hate the vets! What happened?"
8823,Oh man! You know some meds can cause that. Look in too Similasan. They have one that prevents cataracts etc. Expensive ingredients but some are the some from people and dog meds for cataracts/dry eye etc.
8824,That sounds great.  What do they like to do in the yard?
8825,THat is so sweet.  I hope the weather stays nice
8826,Going for a road trip?
8827,"Awesome, sounds like fun! I hope you have a safe trip."
8828,"Aww, how cute. Do you miss playing with your cat?"
8829,It's alright. Your cat is somewhere up in heaven.
8830,What are you going to school for? Online or in person?
8831,"Oh that is tough! Oh man, especially at an alternative one. Make sure you do a lot of self care and don't take stuff too personally from kids :)"
8832,What did that do.. 
8833,I am sorry that someone did that to you..
8834,I know how you feel. I hate lairs.
8835,But you have to do it otherwise you wont be able to trust her.
8836,That's unfortunate.  Especially when there's nothing you can do to stop it.
8837,It can be a vicious cycle. I've seen it before.
8838,Oh man! Are they car keys as well?
8839,Oh my god! Well please get ALL your locks changed. The car will be more difficult however hopefully they have no idea where you live so you should be ok.
8840,"Oh god! How did you get in finally, did you contact your mom?"
8841,That is very difficult. I wish you will find a solution.
8842,I understand. Take it easy.
8843,What are you studying?
8844,Oh great! That has a lot of jobs. I hope you did well!
8845,Tell me about it! I think about getting off as soon as I walk in!
8846,"Yeah. A job is better than no job, I suppose."
8847,That is no good.  I bet he regrets it!
8848,I hope so that is frustrating. 
8849,"Aww, that is so sad to hear. I'm glad that she has a good home now, though!"
8850,That's amazing! I wish more people were willing to do what you're doing to help out our furry friends!
8851,What are the pros of switching jobs?
8852,"Well actually desk jobs are much harder on my body and can be really bad for your back and hips etc, if it's a desk job? Well if you are getting older you might want to start saving up, have a side hustle and maybe think about it? Less pay but more peace, health and time is always worth it :)"
8853,"I also have a dog that was starved when she was young! She is so afraid of everything even to this day, but she's almost 8!"
8854,What breed of dog is she and how old? That's so awesome! Dogs are so resilient and it can teach us a lot about how we should live our own lives.
8855,Awesome! Mine is also a pitbull mix! I call her my little bunny in pitbull form! They are the best dogs ever.
8856,OHH! I Love chickens ! I have always wanted some. I have a duck! lol- What kind of chickens are they?
8857,Oh man! They fight sometimes. I hope they aren't too bad about waking you up in the morning. Chickens can be very sweet though!
8858,Maybe you should be straight with him?  That’s the only thing that will make it good in my opinion. 
8859,I know the type.  There are better people out there that you just have to be patient for. 
8860,Were you all best friends as children?
8861,"Oh geez, that's hard! I am glad you get to see them again. treasure such moments!"
8862,Now that's dedication!
8863,Keep it up. One day you might appear in a fitness magazine. 
8864,I love that when that happens! What is it for?
8865,Love that! Glad you found it
8866,"Yeah, dogs have to learn how to play.  Kinda funny you don't always consider that."
8867,It depends on how young they are.  I have a rescue that was abused but she was real young.  She snapped out of it.
8868,I'm great how are you doing?
8869,"thats great to hear , getting along better with the other students ?"
8870,"Thats awful , i hate bullying have you told the principle ?"
8871,"what did they advice , any martial arts schools around your area, maybe start your kid in it"
8872,Do you know who sent them?
8873,"Awesome, was there any special occasion?"
8874,I bet that was fun to look through
8875,That would be cool.  Are you going to keep them?
8876,i hope that you did well on them
8877,thats great
8878,I can't stand people who treat animals horribly.
8879,"I hope you call the cops on them, so they can go to jail for animal abuse."
8880,I understand. Did you catch some of them in action?
8881,That is bad. I would have the same feeling if I was in your situation.
8882,"I hear you! How old are you? As we get older, all kinds of stuff doesn't work the same"
8883,"Try keto and fasting, or find a diet like RAW and you will be amazed at your energy and strength again!"
8884,Some people have incredible energy and drive! 
8885,True! Often managers do not deserve that role. I am glad he does!
8886,"Oh my god, I HATE when people do that! That stuff can land on someone's windshield!"
8887,"Wow, that's horrible! I would have been so pissed."
8888,Oh my goodness! Why did he move away?
8889,Are you all still together? Long distance can be hard but honestly absence makes you love them even more!
8890,How come you can sit also?
8891,That’s too bad
8892,That is nice. Babysitting kids is sometime nice.
8893,That is terrible.  How do they get away with it?
8894,I am sorry you have to deal with that
8895,That is always good! Errands can be a pain!
8896,I am glad you got some things done! Now you can rest
8897,I guess I never  thought about weather or not car insurance covers your own injuries too
8898,Yeah they're really expensive. 
8899,It's been a mix of a rollercoaster lol.
8900,Wow! Are you going to stay now?
8901,I understand! I would be too! 
8902,"That is great, what was wrong with the dog, how was it abused "
8903,"That is absolutely awful to hear, poor dogs don not deserve to be mistreated in such ways , im happy the dogs better "
8904,Me also when I was young.
8905,That is disappointing. I am sorry
8906,Have you tried talking to them?
8907,"I hate bullies, but they usually get what's coming to them."
8908,I know how you feel. Sometimes you just have to show them the error of their ways. If not karma will catch up with them.
8909,"That is incredibly kind of you, I hope he is a good driver :)"
8910,You are a great friend! We all need help at some point
8911,Oh wow! I'd be afraid to go outside! I hope you are able to stay safe!
8912,That sounds very scary. Ever thought of moving?
8913,I wish you luck! I really hope you can get out of there soon.
8914,I hear you! Have you thought about starting a side business?
8915,great! there are SO many opportunities out there with the internet
8916,That is very nice of him to welcome that poor dog
8917,That is really cool.  good on you for welcoming them
8918,Payday is fantastic! What kind of clothes did you buy?
8919,Do you ever use poshmark or mercari? Those are good for deals. Sounds like you got some nice stuff! Payday is always a fun day
8920,I SO HEAR YOU! lol! Being grown up has it's perks but it's not as great as we thought it would be with all the responsibilities. We ARE the mom and dad now ha
8921,"i freakin  hate that, like dude be sad or mad on your own dont take it out on your family, friends , or co workers "
8922,"Exactly great minds think alike , that is always so annoying as hell "
8923,That is good to hear! Are there any issues?
8924,Oh lord :( I have a partner doing the same thing and he feels more like a son a lot. That must be so hard. Being a parent is the HARDESt job ever. I am so very sorry. I hope he snaps out of it soon.
8925,How come you were worried about it?
8926,It sounds like it might be time to consider moving on without them
8927,Things were much simpler when we were kids. You are your brother must have a close relationship.
8928,I'm sorry to hear that. I guess it makes the times you do see each other even more special!
8929,Oh no!  Was anyone around?
8930,That is no good. I bet that was embarrassing. 
8931,That's disgusting. Did you move to another table?
8932,That's awful.  Some people are disgusting.
8933,I am sorry to hear that. How are you feeling now?
8934,I understand. It is tough.
8935,"Wow, that doesn't happen very often. Well done. Those things are normally quite expensive, aren't they?"
8936,Me too. Clearance is the first place I head for in the store! It must be so difficult to be gluten intolerant - seems as if there's gluten in everything these days.
8937,Something I found which helped me lots was to eat e.g. bread made from organic wheat. So long as I don't overindulge I'm fine - fingers crossed.
8938,"Boy, you are having a tough time. Someone suggested buying imported pasta from Italy as the wheat doesn't have the same pesticides sprayed on it as us wheat. Dunno if it works tho'."
8939,How long has it been?
8940,Whoa! SO needed! What did you guys do?
8941,I am sorry that you had to go through that.  
8942,That is too bad.  It sounds like you need some knew people to surround you
8943,You were suppose to start the conversation with a situation based on the context chosen.
8944,I hope the hit will not be rejected.
8945,"im sorry to hear that, i was born with a lot of anxiety so i can somewhat relate"
8946,"I honestly started taking cbd oil by charlottes web, and my anxiety went away after a few days of using it "
8947,OH! That is the best isn't it? What will you do with it?
8948,Oh awesome! It's always nice to have those little surprises in life.
8949,"What good thing are you waiting for, exactly?"
8950,I'm sure you'll find someone. 
8951,It is good to maintain that contact with people
8952,That is ok sometimes but getting out is important for you too
8953,"Oh yes, what is the temperature where you are?"
8954,"OH! I love around 70! That is perfect. Oh it's over 80 here, getting a little hot but it will  be nice when it's night time :) Nothing like a good  summer to lift the spirits"
8955,"That is awesome!  Congratulations!  So, you are prepared for everything that is about to happen?"
8956,It sure sounds like you have done everything you can to make the day special!
8957,Did you tell his parents?
8958,"That must of been no fun, hopefully he won't do it again."
8959,"I know, Christmas was the best when we were children. Now that were adults it's not as exciting."
8960,"Yeah, I used to love waking up in the morning and run downstairs to open my presents."
8961,What is going on?  Have you seen the dr?
8962,I am so sorry you have to worry about that 
8963,That is nice. Are you planning activities to do with them?
8964,That is great
8965,which country?
8966,thats cool i bet she will have fun
8967,That is really a bummer. Have you looked online for it somewhere else?
8968,That’s no good. 
8969,That's awesome. How come you guys didn't get to see each other often before?
8970,"Was it for work, school, etc?"
8971,Why did she leave?
8972,Does she have another job already?
8973,Wow that must have been embarrassing. 
8974,That is so true!
8975,That sounds really nice! Does it just look better or is travel better?
8976,That will make getting exercise during or after work a lot easier.
8977,That is a very nice person. You are lucky.
8978,I lost my wallet once but didn't find money in it when it was returned to me.
8979,Old photos can be so nostalgic. Do you have a favorite memory?
8980,"Adult life can definitely be difficult, but we get a lot of freedom now though."
8981,That's amazing! What are you studying?
8982,what kind of job are you hoping to get?
8983,That sounds amazing!
8984,It's pretty early to have Christmas planned already. I should get on that as well.
8985,When will you find out?
8986,"Hopefully you win, what is the prize?"
8987,"i used to be, not quite as much anymore"
8988,yes my friends play it
8989,Oh me too. Have you ever messed with them?
8990,Where are you going boating?
8991,What do you like to do on the lake?
8992,thats crazy! was he ok?
8993,thats great.  i love kids
8994,Thats unfortunate
8995,Was it for a contest or a class?
8996,"Oh no, must be disappointing. Are you putting off making it now or will you go in search for the missing mustard?"
8997,Will it taste the same?
8998,Do you like museums?
8999,"Same here. Neither do I, but there are impressive museums out there that kinda make you change your stance."
9000,I love going to Costco.
9001,I always get rice and steak there.
9002,"Oh, cool!  What kind of turtle was it?"
9003,It sounds like it may have been a box turtle.  They are good as pets!
9004,Maybe you can have them get you on one of the kiddie ones first?
9005,Hope you have fun!
9006,I always worry about that too. Is it early in the morning?
9007,Will you be able to leave a little bit earlier to allow time for any traffic delays?
9008,Are you in your basement?
9009,"That is smart, hopefully thou it doesn't happen."
9010,"thats unfortunate, sucks missing out on time with your family"
9011,you definitely gotta appreciate them while you can
9012,That's really nice.   Sometimes things work out ok.
9013,Did you just forget your wallet or did you not have any money at all?
9014,lol a trap for what?
9015,I guess you're not at all attracted to her then?
9016,"Aww, I just had to put my dog down last month."
9017,"It was very sad and I am sorry you had to go through that,"
9018,That was very nice of him.
9019,How long have you known him?
9020,"Oh, are you guys distant?"
9021,I'm glad you guys can start to come together again.
9022,"Oh no, why didn't they?"
9023,I guess you might have to reconsider this friendship.
9024,When is the competition?
9025,What is the grand prize?
9026,"i love taking trips, where was your favorite place to go'?"
9027,ive been there several times but its not my favorite place
9028,"That was nice of him, did you put gas in it?"
9029,Did you drive it fast?
9030,"Oh god, why did he do that?"
9031,Bad situations make you things you wouldn't normally sometimes. Did you talk to him about it?
9032,Oh my! Were you okay?
9033,Yeah that would be a little embarrassing I am sure. 
9034,That's sad. is she going to get another one?
9035,That's good. Its important for the elderly to have some company.
9036,thats great its always good to plan ahead
9037,im the same way
9038,If you love the house. go for it.
9039,You need to do some prosmection and you will find the rate interest that you want.
9040,We've all done stupid things. I'm sure they'll let it go eventually.
9041,You'll know for next time now. I know you must feel really bad.
9042,Uh oh!  What happens if you can't get an earlier flight?  Will you miss the wedding?
9043,I would be feeling quite anxious if I were you!  I am sure it will work out for you!
9044,That sounds terrifying! Are you okay now?
9045,"Makes you appreciate life more, doesn't it."
9046,I love Korean barbeque.
9047,Is it open 24 hours a day?
9048,I'm so sorry to hear that. How long ago was this?
9049,it's terrible to lose someone. Was this expected or sudden?
9050,have you swam before?
9051,just gotta be careful where you swim
9052,That was a wonderful surprise I am sure.
9053,Oh wow! What a blessing!
9054,Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry to hear that.
9055,I know that's gonna to be a terrible loss for the family. 
9056,Did it ruin the laptop?
9057,Are you going to buy him a new one?
9058,Was it your first race?
9059,That must really disappointing. Will you race again?
9060,where has he been?
9061,thats cool. what does he do for a living?
9062,Are you going to take one?
9063,Yikes that's a little crazy.   Are they cat collectors?
9064,Is it gonna turn out bad without it?
9065,That's a relief then! Hope it's still delicious!
9066,thats really awesome!
9067,im really glad to hear it got worked out
9068,Those little guys are quite nimble!  Did is surprise you?
9069,"Yeah, I guess they need to be agile to escape all the neighborhood cats!"
9070,That sounds awful! Did they give an explanation?
9071,You must be disappointed. I'm sorry.
9072,I'm inclined to agree with you.  That's kinda strange.  The guy's ok with it? 
9073,Must've been really nostalgic. Did you guys catch up on your lives now?
9074,what kind of cake do you like?
9075,"haha me too, never met a cake i didn't like."
9076,Going to a new restaurant is always fun!  I am sure it will be great if there are a bunch of positive reviews!
9077,Yummmy!  That sounds amazing!  I am sure you will have fun!
9078,It's nice to know the time your spent studying paid off! Congrats!
9079,Better to be over prepared than under.
9080,maybe they went to see a movie?
9081,can you call them on their cell?
9082,Thats exciting.  How did that go?
9083,That's almost a little strange.  Do you still have any interest in her?
9084,What dish are you trying out?
9085,Oh now you're just making me hungry!
9086,Boo!  Did it make you mad?  I would have been!
9087,Rightly so!  Nothing worse than expecting something and then it not being there!
9088,Must be really lonely. You're not trying to go on a guys' night out or anything?
9089,"That's really sweet! Maybe they miss you, too."
9090,That sounds so relaxing! What kind of dog do you have.
9091,Dogs are a good source of entertainment.
9092,that is interesting.  did you ever date?
9093,oh yes that's true.  i thought you might have dated later in life. 
9094,That's prett cool. Has she shown you?
9095,Oh so you're both hunters!
9096,Some habits die hard.  My mom's always trying to send me food still.. I'm a grown man.
9097,"I know, right.  Its kind of annoying but, also kind of nice."
9098,"wow, where did ya'll live at the time."
9099,So you guys never did visits or anything?
9100,"Must feel terrible. Well, at least, you don't have to look after them then."
9101,I love dogs! what kind?
9102,mutts are the most loveable.
9103,That sounds like a good night.  what movie?
9104,hachi.  best dog movie ever.
9105,That sounds exciting.  How long will you be staying?
9106,That's cool. Do you have everything planned out?
9107,Sounds nice. What's the temperature where you are?
9108,I think I wouldn't go outside in close to 100 degree weather. That's crazy.
9109,"That's great! I wish more people would garden, so much healthier to grow your own food."
9110,That's fabulous.  Love it when the older generation teaches the younger ones.
9111,That's awesome! You must be feeling more alive and well
9112,It's amazing how reaching those kinds of health goals brings things that you would have never even imagined before going through with it
9113,"Right, you always see the before and after pictures of other people but as you're doing it, it seems to take forever"
9114,"Yeah, a lot of the times it would just come back as fast as it got lost"
9115,Insurance companies suck.  I hate dealing with them.
9116,They're trying to not pay if they don't have too.    more $ in their bank.
9117,That is awesome!  I would love to get something like that from a relative!  Does it have any sentimental value?
9118,That was so nice that your were chosen to get it and hopefully pass it on again!
9119,"Wow! 6th grade, that's amazing. Are you planning on celebrating?"
9120,Fun! He must be really passionate about learning 
9121,"That's really special, and a great attitude to have"
9122,Looks like the future is bright for him
9123,What's wellington?
9124,"Cool, where do you get your venison from?"
9125,Anymore? Are they ever safe??
9126,What made hers unsafe?
9127,"Cool, you guys can race and whoever loses gets a new one"
9128,"Good, How long haven't you talk to each other?"
9129,"Wow, she is a little weird."
9130,I bet that feels good
9131,It definitely does.  You shouldn't have to stress about your job
9132,It sounds like you have a lot of animals!
9133,"For sure, they can teach us a lot"
9134,That is very considerate of you. What are your duties as class mom?
9135,"Ah, I miss naps. If only I could go back to Kindergarten."
9136,Those are so gross.
9137,Did you put the cat in time out?
9138,Oh cool.  You got it then?
9139,Oh no!  Are you alright?
9140,Oh I bet! How long has it been?
9141,That will be a very nice reunion.
9142,I miss mine too. Where did you guys grow up?
9143,Canada is such a beautiful country. Was there a lot of things to do there for you kids?
9144,Nice. Good luck with that. You are interviewing for which position?
9145,Wow. Good luck. I hope you get the position.
9146,That sounds relaxing
9147,What game did you play?
9148,It is a great feeling when we can say that. My 37th child just became self-sufficient last year as well!
9149,"I know! I think my wife is calling it quits after the 38th, though."
9150,Sorry to hear!  What all did you order?  And what was wrong with it?
9151,"Cold fries are the *worst* b/c the potatoes are just gross at that point.  Did you get your money back, at least?"
9152,Oh bless your heart!  I'm sorry to hear!  I'd have returned it and gotten the whole meal free for the cold messed up fries!
9153,"That's good! Hopefully you'll be compensated in some way for the fries.  Ugh, cold fries!  You're way nicer about it than I would have been."
9154,Nice. What did you buy?
9155,"Ah, a must in a household of rugrats."
9156,Are you mad at them?
9157,Oh my word! I thought bobcats were mythical like unicorns.
9158,wow. was it expensive?
9159,That's crazy!
9160,Awesome!  Are you excited to go?
9161,You sound prepared!  I am sure you will make a good impression on the other party goers!
9162,Oh wow!  You were pretty angry
9163,I guess you are right
9164,Neat! Where are you going?
9165,Sweet! What are you going to be doing there? Always wanted to take a journey to the South.
9166,Oh. wow. Did you cry?
9167,Your kid should be on America's got Talent! unless you're not in america.
9168,What is your new job like?
9169,"That's pretty neat! I work in a Nike sweatshop in Siberia, so I really can't say the same!"
9170,Physics? That must be crazy hard.
9171,Well good luck. I think you'll do well if you studied that hard.
9172,All one? I prefer to be all two in my house.
9173,"Yeah, being alone a big ole house is often times more spooky than not. I almost got nabbed by a ghost the last time I was alone."
9174,"Ugh, that's the worst!  Bright side - at least you weren't far from home that you were able to clean everything up, right?"
9175,"*blinks*  One, I didn't know possums travelled in herds and two, I am only hoping your day didn't get worse from there?"
9176,"Bless it!  And you survived all of that to tell the tale!  And all of this over a busted garbage bag!  We gotta get you a better brand of garbage bags, friend.  :)"
9177,Good job!  How are you doing so far?
9178,It is tough.  Don't be too hard on yourself.  Just do better moving forward
9179,That's nice
9180,That's so true. I was scared to put my kids in daycare
9181,Wow! They are pretty lucky!
9182,Yes that would be nice.
9183,"Awesome, a bird left the nest.  How old is he?"
9184,Awe a little sentimental? 
9185,That wonderful!  Did he initiate it?
9186,That’s great and a relief
9187,I know the feeling
9188,I definitely know that feeling lol
9189,Are you still close?
9190,That's sad. Have you reached out to her?
9191,That's not bad. I only see people in my family once ever few years.
9192,Oh wow! Congrats?  Boy or girl?
9193,That is great that you are prepared!
9194,It's always nice to have some good friends.
9195,I do have a few really good ones. 
9196,That sounds exciting!  Are you nervous about it?
9197,"It's not the easiest thing to do, and so very few states ask for it.  The state I come from requires it.  It's just something you use in so very few situations, I'm surprised they still test for it."
9198,Sounds like a plan!  that's the only way you'll get better!
9199,Are you scared or excited?
9200,My first few years I went from the east coast to Colorado. It will be the best time of your life.
9201,Enjoy it before you get old. Before you know it college will be over and you will be a slave to student loan payments.
9202,I've been there.
9203,That's sweet.
9204,What kind of restaurant?
9205,Man that is pretty crazy being that young even.
9206,Me two. No bills and just relax and play.
9207,Being stressed never helps. 
9208,It could always be worse. People in the 3rd world are on the edge of death from having no food.
9209,"It is ok. If the teacher was not angry, it should be fine."
9210,We have cold winters but hardly ever any snow. I'm glad too
9211,Did you follow him home and confront him?
9212,Perhaps he thought the same about you?
9213,How'd she do?  Did she get the right clothes?
9214,Were the three things not in the dress code?
9215,Yiiiiiiiiiiikes!  Long sleeves in the heat!  *cringes*  Times like these make me glad our schools went to uniforms!  But I understand about the heat - we're in short sleeved polos until November at the earliest.
9216,"Sounds like what kids would do!  But the bright side is, if you have two days worth of fall or winter, she's prepared!"
9217,"Oh no, what was it?  Not too bad I hope."
9218,"That isn't half as bad as what I was thinking it might be.  Glad to hear it was just overindulging in food.  Oh well, you always have tomorrow to be better!"
9219,That is awesome. You should marry her again lol
9220,That's awesome!  I know that took a lot of hard work!
9221,That's the best way to go about it - make sure you have time for all the things you need time for.  That way you're not running around like a chicken with your head cut off.
9222,Are you gonna try to keep that sort of balance going forward?
9223,Are you going to eat them?
9224,Give them to a homeless person.
9225,That is great when that can happen but it doesn't always if one or both love a lot! I hope you remain friends.
9226,I hope so too!
9227,That is terrible.  Did you lose all the food that was in there or were you able to save it?
9228,That is so terrible.  It would be nice if the refrigerator company had to replace all of your groceries if their product breaks!  Did you get a new one yet?
9229,That's awesome. Congratulatios
9230,Just hope for a happy healthy baby!
9231,Congratulations. Yes it can be very hard to get pregnant and carry children for some. I know how that goes
9232,I do but both are in heaven. But they are still my children..doctors/midwive mistakes on me (in a lawsuit) and so it affected the second one. Not trying again until I can go to a specialized doctor and get in perfect health.
9233,"Be very careful. It was just an untreated UTI in me and then they wouldn't help me when I had HELLP syndrome for awhile..I went to a few doctors too..none were good-and I was full term..I almost bled out..The littlest things sometimes can really hurt you and your baby. I am so sorry! I am so glad you had 1, take good care of yourself and follow your gut :)"
9234,"Oh, how adorable! There are so many bunnies around right now.  My parents house has especially a lot of them and they don't really run off like normal either."
9235,That is so precious.  I have never seen that before.  Baby bunnies are the best!  I've had 3 bunnies/rabbits in my lifetime and they were great pets.  What are your bunnies' names?
9236,"lol, oh no!  My albino rabbit I had when I was younger was like that....skittish beyond belief!  Those are adorable names!"
9237,"Not to me!  Some part of me is anxious to be holding a grandchild, and then when they poop or get fussy, to hand them riiiiiiight back to their parents!"
9238,"On the one hand I miss them because there's nothing in the world like baby smell.  On the other, the best day of my life so far was when my youngest was potty-trained!"
9239,A.ww that must have been so cute
9240,I've never seen a bunny. That;s weird
9241,Oh no! That is a hard thing to think about. You might want to take some time apart and find it out to be fair to him
9242,Well think about what qualities he has- There are so many dishonest people out there and abusive people. Sometimes we don't connect with someone good..but will regret it later. Definitely think on it as you'd never want to lose a good trustworthy person even if you just keep them as a friend
9243,"Aw, I am sorry, they will be back soon though?"
9244,"Never bad, good mom or dad :) They are only young once"
9245,That makes me mad too
9246,People let things get out of hand and it is so unecessary.
9247,Uh oh! Was everything ruined?
9248,Oh how disappointing. 
9249,That must feel awesome
9250,I feel that way when my kids are gone
9251,"I swear, the DMV is the *worst*!"
9252,"Yeah, but the state would never get out of debt if they had to pay the people for missing work just to wait in inefficient lines at the DMV."
9253,That's understandable. What happened?
9254,That's hard. Are they in a new relationship? I hope it wasn't a bad breakup?
9255,"That's hard! If he was bad to you, I hope you are able to get over it, if not, you can always reach out :)"
9256,you have to let those people go
9257,Lol. That's gross
9258,I wouldn't either. She should find another job lol
9259,That's no good. How did that happen?
9260,Dang. Well I bet that really worked to get your point across haha
9261,"Oh, wow.  That's a long time.  How old were you when you first went in?"
9262,"Ha ha.  Now I know you're kidding me.  50 years?  I think you served your time for that offense, wiouldn't you say?"
9263,South Carolina is really nice. What are you planning on doing there?
9264,Sounds like a grand ole time. Everyone likes the good ole carriage ride every now and again.
9265,Did you get a call back?
9266,We believe it and you just might
9267,Oh darn that is stressful I bet.
9268,That's no good. How does that happen?
9269,I happy you're not being abused either.
9270,Some people make it to the other side. I'm glad ou did.
9271,I hear you :) I do the same
9272,I know right? I am working on a side business so I can do that one day. You should totally get a side hustle.
9273,I understand! What are you going to school for?
9274,"I bet, it can help people and pay a lot in a career as well. Good luck!"
9275,"Ouch, sounds like you really like working out with your friends."
9276,"I'm no doctor, but it sounds like you might need even more to balance things out."
9277,"After being married for that long, I really don't blame you. Do you want to move on and find someone else?"
9278,"Well, if that's how you feel then maybe it is best if you stay in the dugout and don't play the field. No shame in that."
9279,Did she get into any trouble?
9280,Well that was very nice of her. Did you give her anything in return?
9281,Did she get a cute bandaid?
9282,That's sweet. You should've took a picture and framed it so you guys can cherish that moment forever
9283,I hear ya there.  When did you lose her
9284,That is exactly how I would describe my grandma.  YOu are lucky to have had her
9285,That is very nice to friendly neighboors.
9286,"Yes, Now days, most neighbors don't talk to each other."
9287,Congratulations!  I'm sure everything is going to turn out well.  You probably have to see your doctor more than usual to make sure everything is okay.
9288,That's definitely a good sign!
9289,That sucks. Why did he/she do that?
9290,"Yeah, ignorance in youthfulness is sometimes a good thing. That's really terrible of your ex, though. He should be burned at the stake."
9291,I used to think that too. I could sleep if it wasn't closed all the way
9292,And you could have caught him in the closet!!!
9293,Oh wow!  Did the guy get caught?
9294,That would be.  I am so sorry you had to go through that.
9295,That sounds like you have some good help now. How old are they?
9296,"Its good that they are thoughtful, sound like very well mannered kids!!!"
9297,What position do you play?
9298,Are you taking some orange slices to spice things up?
9299,What was holding you back?
9300,"If you could do it all over again, how would you overcome , and pardon me for saying this, your wimpy-ness?"
9301,That is awesome.  Did you find out what it was for?
9302,"That sounds like a jolly good time, ole chap. What shows/movies are you planning on watching?"
9303,Nice. The Office is one of my favorite shows. I do enjoy Steve Carrell's character.
9304,Awwwww!  You guys are doing the right thing.  How is it doing today?
9305,That's fair enough.  I wouldn't know what to do with a hurt bird.
9306,That is bad. Did you already made reservation and purchase airline tickets?
9307,Good. There was no else that could replace the person sick?
9308,Wow. I bet that was a nice surprise. Did you get a lot of presents? 
9309,Sounds great. You are lucky to have such thoughtful coworkers. 
9310,Oh wow that is disgusting
9311,What are you going to do?
9312,Where do you guys work?
9313,That's pretty neat. I imagine is very nice working from home. I wish I could so that I can stop working at the Nike sweatshop.
9314,That's a bummer. Did you get it repaired?
9315,"Well, that's good. At least everything turned out okay in the end."
9316,"Oh wow, I bet that made you smile"
9317,That is very awesome
9318,That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you ride a lot of rides?
9319,Did you ride any that made you sick? Some of the ones that go upside down always make me sick. haha.
9320,I am sure they learned from you
9321,I am as well. Even if it is a simple thatched roof.
9322,Indeed. The world can use a lot less people.
9323,How come it felt bad?
9324,That is terrible.  WHy?
9325,"Yes, thats always a good thing. Have you been working long?"
9326,Wow. I bet you are grateful to be working. Being jobless is a horrible place to be. 
9327,That is no good. How is she doing now?
9328,That is horrible!  I would've been too.  That actually happened to me but thankfully it was an old account that I didn't use.  Did they take money from you?
9329,"I just think that's the worst way for the IRS to do things though. Life is hard and once you have debt from any numbers of things, it can be hard to climb back out of the red.  I'm so sorry you had that shock and I hope they work with you on payments.  "
9330,"He'll have a great time, though.  He'll make tons of friends and his days will be full of joy!  You will need some hobbies though."
9331,With all the extra time you have you should start a counseling service.  I know your mom would use you!
9332,Did you have fun
9333,I do love getting gifts
9334,That's awesome. Are you and your aunt close?
9335,That's cool man. I'm really not close to any of my relatives.
9336,Im sorry to hear that. What made you scared?
9337,Wow! I bet that is scary. Good to know you made it okay. 
9338,what did they advise you to do?
9339,Awesome.  Are you nervous?
9340,You definitely will
9341,That's really neat. Did you guys have an easter egg hunt?
9342,That's cool. Who collected the most eggs?
9343,What band was it?
9344,You need to speak up next time
9345,"Good, thats what needed to happen"
9346,How come you were afraid?
9347,goodluck!
9348,yea i think we have all been there
9349,"I am sorry, I am sure he will be safe"
9350,I am sure you are
9351,"Four is a pretty cool number. I am a bigger fan of 5, though."
9352,What was wrong with your Dad?
9353,"Oh no. I'm so sorry.  I feel you.  I lost my sweet springer spaniel, Pepper, not long ago. Are you coping okay?"
9354,"Well, that's a wonderful thing.  You had a good time with the first one and this new one will breathe life into your day and pull any sadness away.  What will you name it?"
9355,"It's nice to have someone that is helpful around the house.  Does he work, too?"
9356,Well that is too bad.  Maybe there is some way you can motivate him to work harder.
9357,why is that
9358,i hope it turns out well for you!
9359,It is.  What are you referring to?
9360,of course you were
9361,Wow. How did you manage to eat that many? Maybe you should have shared. 
9362,You should enter a eating contest. Sounds like you could win. 
9363,That sucks. How does that make you feel?
9364,"Yeah, that's how it was with my younger brother too. He always go his way."
9365,That’s no good. Why?
9366,That would scare me too
9367,oh sorry to hear that
9368,"Dang, that sucks. When do you find out if you got the job?"
9369,I think you are overreacting. Just try to find your medicine and calm yourself down. I am sure you will get the job.
9370,That sounds terrible! I'm sorry that happened to you. I hope everything is okay now. Do you know what caused it?
9371,"Eww.. Rotten eggs.. That's terrible. I know eggs are so healthy for you, but I never touch them partly because of how they smell when they're cooked/prepared in certain ways. Again, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. Was there anybody nice enough to help you when you were on the bus, or how did that end up?"
9372,That is really something to be proud of
9373,Why not just call him? Its not unheard of.
9374,Maybe he is just busy right now. I wouldn't lose hope yet. 
9375,That is a good news. Did he kept them with him for a long period of time?
9376,That sucks. What sport?
9377,You're not good at a single one of those? I was a strong swimmer when I was a kid.
9378,i can understand that
9379,the NICU thats wonderful
9380,Oh fun!  What kind of dog does she have?  What's its name?
9381,My mom had a husky named Heidi for almost 16 years.  They are beautiful dogs but boy can they run away fast if they get an opportunity.
9382,Sometimes sibling rivalry dies hard -- even when you've well outgrown it. Are y'all far apart in age?
9383,I love your heart. That's important. Are you a brother or a sister to them?
9384,Please do. Sometimes it takes time to mature on an emotional level. It's cool that you have that on them :-)
9385,Nice! Where did you meet your date?
9386,That's really cool. Where is the date going to be at?
9387,That is nasty. What are you going to do?
9388,I am with you 
9389,How did that feel?
9390,"That must be hard sometimes, but I guess also has its advantages. "
9391,I bet. Maybe he will move closer to you soon. 
9392,That's awesome.  What level of math is it?
9393,I always had trouble with math so anything above counting is beyond what I feel competent in.  Good luck on the test!
9394,That's really cool! What kind of memories resurfaced?
9395,"Oh, I am sorry for being so insensitive. I am sure your mother is in a better place."
9396,Wow! What happened?  I hope everything is  okay.
9397,What? Nothing too bad I guess...
9398,did he get ma?
9399,hellz yea.. all about number 1
9400,"That is terrible, my friend. How do you think it is going to affect your friendship>"
9401,I'm sure it won't be too bad. You just have to work hard and hopefully you'll get promoted next time.
9402,"Oh cool!  Do you play in the game or get to be the cooler part of the team, the waterboy?"
9403,Ha ha! Awesome!  I bet you're great at it!  Get out a hose and just water them down! Its faster.  Hope you have a great game tomorrow!  Don't forget the orange slices.
9404,Why are you going to the court?
9405,I understand. I hope things will go smoothly.
9406,That is good.  You will feel better
9407,That is horrible. Were you able to do anything about it.?
9408,I am so sorry to hear that. I wish there was something more you could do.
9409,Ir is almost all kid that do that. He will get used to it.
9410,People can be bad some time. I hope it will be better.
9411,what happened
9412,well at least you made it through
9413,oh yea im not surprised though.
9414,"yea after the finals, at least he didnt go to the GSW haha"
9415,What is your interview for?
9416,That's pretty cool. Do you think you will get the job?
9417,That sounds really peaceful
9418,That is so good for the soul
9419,I bet that brought back memories. Hopefully good ones. 
9420,"Wow, I bet that was a happy surprise. I love looking at old pictures. "
9421,Are you alright?
9422,I am sorry you have to deal with that. 
9423,how did it go? congrats btw
9424,hah .. it gets better
9425,Why did your family leave? Sorry that you felt that way.
9426,What did you do all by yourself?
9427,Oh my god. Did you guys have a fight?
9428,"It's just an extra tomato, man. You're going to let that ruin your relationship with your turtle?"
9429,Oh yeah? What is going to be your hallmark meal?
9430,Can't go wrong the sushi and steak special. A classic in Alaska.
9431,That's too bad. Why were you all alone?
9432,Interesting. Why wouldn't they take you along?
9433,oh wow.. how are you feeling
9434,It was the right thing to do. Getting used to not having someone around is going to take some time.
9435,"It will take time, but I'm sure you'll be okay."
9436,What a monumental event!  I bet you're so excited.  What took her away for so long?
9437,She sounds smart.  Are you nervous at all or just thrilled to be with her again?
9438,Is the dog potty trained?
9439,That pool noodle must be terrifying for her.
9440,Did your cat show the bird who's boss?
9441,That's somewhat offensive.
9442,No I haven't. Is it good? 
9443,Sounds interesting. I will have to check it out. 
9444,I will. But I dont scare easily. 
9445,That's so sad. I'm sorry
9446,Have you ever tried writing? That's what I do
9447,"You're hosting a party? or attending one? Either way, social gatherings can always be a lot of pressure, so that's why I usually avoid them, unfortunately. What are some of your worries, if you don't mind me asking?"
9448,"Oh, so you're hosting. Man, that's definitely hard. I really do feel for you, as I wouldn't have the courage to do that. Well, since you're worried about it, at least it shows you care. And you still have plenty of time to prepare! Do you have anyone that can help?"
9449,That is so sweet!
9450,It is a good sign that she shows that kind of care to them
9451,damn did you do it all alone or you had help? are you lebron james living in a mansion?
9452,ah thats understandable 
9453,I'm sorry to hear that! Did you find your dog?
9454,Did you try calling your local shelter?
9455,Oh no. You didn't have anyone to go with?
9456,Wow. That's some friends you have there.
9457,Did everyone end up contributing to the project?
9458,I am sure they will. They have to if they want to get a good grade.
9459,Tornados are terrifing. Are you ok?
9460,That's good to hear. Glad you're ok.
9461,Lectures can be boring
9462,I do miss some of my class
9463,where you going?
9464,oh that sounds great. good luck
9465,why did they say no?
9466,Im so sorry.. I wish I could fix that for you.
9467,"That sounds like it could be fun, or was it sad?"
9468,Oh no! Well those aren't such good friends.
9469,That is too bad. Why are you on the keto diet?
9470,"Yeah, that diet is somewhat expensive. Has it been hard sticking to it?"
9471,History is a lot of memorizing. Glad you did well.
9472,How were the rest of your exams?
9473,"Oh well, there is always next weekend"
9474,I am sure you will find something
9475,"Oh lord, that made me almost vomit! I choke easy too, I am sorry!"
9476,Not your fault at all! Somethings can't be helped.
9477,"I did attend college, but I am one of those statistics you hear about....a dropout."
9478,I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes kids don't know how to interact well with each other. But it's an important part of the socializing part of life that they work their way through it. All you can do is tell them how to respectfully and appropriately respond and defend themselves.
9479,"Ah.. so it's that kind of situation. Yeah, it can be one thing if it's just something where kids are acting like kids, and you can't physically intervene in time. But it's another if you think it's neglect and that they're not responding appropriately to the situation. I would trust your judgment. I hope everything ends well with it though! I'm sure you gave your child lots of love afterward."
9480,It happens even when we study hard sometimes!
9481,"true! Life is full of learning, I am glad you have learned something from it, so many don't. Kudos!"
9482,"I am sorry, was the cat okay"
9483,That does sound scary
9484,Good for her. Never too late to go back to school.
9485,Oh wow. She sounds like super woman!
9486,I don't blame you. Those things are creepy
9487,I got a clown for my daughters 4 birthday. Every single kids cried lol
9488,"I understand that, I am not either with some of my family! We are not always born in too families that are like us,"
9489,"I am sorry, are they very mean or abusive?"
9490,Well then it's no loss! Find family in others. That is no family!
9491,Cat room? I've never heard of such a thing.
9492,Did any of the cats get out?
9493,Maybe you should get cameras
9494,wow thats great
9495,every few years.. and its enough!
9496,"Yeah, that's never something to complain about--well, unless you were fired, I guess, but that doesn't sound like that was the case! I'm happy for you, too. Did you do anything fun with your extra time?"
9497,"Well, that was nice of you. I'm glad you got a chance to squeeze in more family time and didn't go spend it just sitting around or something. I hope that happens more often for you."
9498,Fun!  Those can be addictive for me.  I only get them around Christmas time...not sure why but its a fun stocking stuffer.  Did you win?
9499,I hope you win too!  Scratch them now and let me know if you win.  Now I'm excited for you! Hope you hit a big bank!
9500,Oh wow.. are you going there to surprise her
9501,well don't worry too much ... the food isnt the most important thing and I am sure it will at least be satisfactory.  Focus on the family
9502,That is not good. So no way to get the info back
9503,"I am sorry, that sounds terrible"
9504,Does your dad still live nearby?
9505,I am so sorry to hear that. His memory lives on though.
9506,Oh gross! What restaurant?
9507,"I would blast them on social media. That is not good, especially for them not to take responsibility for it."
9508,Yea. Floors get dirty pretty quickly with dust. Will you be replacing the vacuum?
9509,I actually got a vacuum myself but made a bad decision. The thing does not suck well.
9510,What breed is it?
9511,"I love boxers, and their cut off tails."
9512,Wow. I hope it was a clean diaper.
9513,Who knew a diaper would be so terrifying.
9514,"That sounds like so much fun.  I hope you have a good, relaxing time.  Where are you going?"
9515,I hope it's a better experience by the pier than mine.  hahahaha.
9516,That's good. Are you getting the hang of it?
9517,It's better to write things down than try to keep things in your head.
9518,That sucks. What store is it?
9519,We have a lot of those where I live.
9520,Nice! Is this your first time having that done?
9521,"How come, what happened?"
9522,"Oh geez! lol! Just watch tv online :) I do- that way always something I like, I can watch"
9523,I love cheesecake
9524,Oh no! Was is plain or did it have sweet toppings too?
9525,I wish I could make a cheescake.
9526,What stores are you going to
9527,News clothes are always nice
9528,oh my gosh!  I am glad you are ok!!!
9529,Where do you live?  Kansas?
9530,Oh dogs are so sweet. Was it your first time?
9531,he lived? Oh no. What happened?!
9532,what did you do
9533,good luck next time!
9534,"That's amazing, first child?"
9535,"Cherish every moment, they grow up SO fast!"
9536,"Isn't that the best feeling when something you really want is actually on deep discount, and you are just in the right place at the right time!"
9537,I am right there with you.  I hope this is a sign of a great week to come!
9538,I'm glad they won!
9539,Were the opposing team a really tough one?
9540,Oh I bet you enjoyed that
9541,I bet you will
9542,"I am sorry, why didn't he come?"
9543,I bet he hated missing it too! Work is good for bills but it interferes a lot with life
9544,That is not good. I am glad they are okay though
9545,I would be too
9546,You seem a bit jealous.
9547,You should talk to your friend about it. 
9548,How precious!  How old is she now?  What does the ornament look like?
9549,What a wonderful nostalgic piece.  My daughter is 8 and growing up way too fast.  I have a hand print ornament she made and I can't believe one day she'll be 13!
9550,That's awesome. What subject was it?
9551,History is one my favorites as well!
9552,Thats bad timing for sure
9553,Well at least they got out
9554,You are a good parent.  How do you have space for it all?
9555,I guess you'll have to get a storage unit.  The question then is what goes in the storage unit?  Furniture or the kids crafts.  Haha.
9556,Thats always a plus
9557,That happens to me too. I go to the store almost every day
9558,Does he live far away?
9559,That makes sense. Did you have fun?
9560,What movie is it
9561,Well as long as they love it
9562,That sounds amazing!   What do you have planned?
9563,That sounds great!
9564,That's so neat when friendships last so long.
9565,I am sure you guys have a great bond and many fun memories.
9566,No one came to take care of you?
9567,Was the cat nice? I know they can be sassy when they don't get all of the attention lol
9568,Healthy is important
9569,"I guess, but they can always teach them"
9570,"Oh wow, you must have been thrilled!"
9571,That's great when someone you love puts in the extra effort to be there for you
9572,"Thats not good, I remember bad times at school. What happened?"
9573,One good friend who you can trust is better than a bunch you can't. It's just part of growing up sometimes. School can be an exercise in mental strength.
9574,"Yes, I hope she can find her self worth in who she is. It's just part of growing up. It's hard"
9575,What kind of birds are they?
9576,Thats so sweet of you.
9577,That can be one of the hardest parts of life. Very tough
9578,How did it go? Is it college?
9579,"I am sorry, roommates can be annoying sometimes"
9580,I will not either
9581,"Ah! That's kind of a scary thought, but I bet that would also be kind of fun. I live in a city with a very extensive history that is utilized a lot in ""haunted"" trips and stuff like that, so I have seen them around and have wondered about going on one. Do you believe in ghosts?"
9582,"Yeah, I can totally understand that. It can be exhilarating and a different experience, I would imagine. But I would understand that you wouldn't want to have to deal with the after effects. I never have trouble with nightmares, so I don't worry about that. As for me, I'm still on the fence about ghosts."
9583,That's really too bad. I know how that feels. Have you tried telling her how you feel about it?
9584,That must be really difficult and lonely for you. I hope you guys can get something figured out.
9585,Sounds like a good kid. What has he been working on.
9586,That's great! How old is he?
9587,That is nice of you.  Where has he been?
9588,Sometimes you gotta stand up for yourself.
9589,"If they know you, they should know better."
9590,"Talk about an unwelcome guest! I would have immediately slammed my door shut! I never know how to respond in those situations, as in whether or not they're dangerous, etc. What did you do?"
9591,"I did not expect that kind of reaction! But I guess I don't know enough about possums. Maybe that makes sense. I compare them almost to raccoons, who I've seen be very aggressive. Well, it looks you made a new friend. I hope you named them!"
9592,You are so lucky!
9593,I know exactly what you mean. Someone returned my purse at the casino once. It still had my money in it!
9594,"That must be incredibly annoying to have to deal with. To constantly have to battle for what you feel is justified support, and to always be worrying about it in the back of your head. You have to be really resilient to go through that."
9595,"Wow.. That's almost noble. I hope you're able to still properly survive without it, especially since it's unfair that you're not getting it in the first place. I'm sorry you're being put in that position. One day I'm sure your children will recognize and appreciate you had to go through for them."
9596,Don't be too hard on yourself. You taught yourself a lesson for next time.
9597,I'm in college I understand. Just have to keep pushing forward and you'll so great
9598,Oh no.  I have experienced that before and its not pleasant.  Its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when you're near a snob.
9599,"Seriously!  I just keep thinking that they are a person just like me and it doesn't always means they are better than me just because they are entitled.  As they say, everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time."
9600,Ugh! So you have corrupt police officers in your town too? That is a bummer!
9601,I would too! Most officers dont show up for that.
9602,Your mom is awesome
9603,Maybe you should go on a trip together
9604,Oh yeah? That sounds awesome. That's how it should be! Can you tell me a little bit about them?
9605,"Haha, that's incredible. A lot of parents wouldn't feel that way... After 18, they're done. That's pretty cool of you to feel that way, but I guess that speaks volumes about the kind of kids you have and how good they are. It sounds like you raised them right."
9606,I hops so too! Work does come first or the bills can't be paid! :)
9607,What kind of birthday are you having?
9608,Wow! Enjoy it! What did you accomplish if I may ask?
9609,That is something that is a dream! Enjoy it so much! congrats
9610,I am so sorry to hear that.  When will you see them again?
9611,That is so sad to hear.  I hope things go well with the therapy and you are reunited soon.
9612,"There's absolutely nothing I can say to make you feel better about that. I'm sorry for your great losses. Just from those few sentences alone, I can tell you were very passionate about them. What were their names, if you don't mind me asking?"
9613,"Those are great names! And that does sound like a good idea, as long as you're comfortable with it. It's such a tenuous situation.. to want another pet to fill the void, but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they don't live up to their predecessors. My girlfriend will be in the same situation when her dog passes. She's already getting nervous since her dog is 10-years-old."
9614,"Oh gross!  I've heard of flies or ants being in an ear, but a roach?  That gives me chills because I hate roaches sooooo much.  Now I might have nightmares tonight!"
9615,"EW!  I might start sleeping with ear plugs in now too.  I've heard you eat 8 spiders on average in a lifetime, some in your sleep.  So many things to be scared of with bugs! I'm so glad they were able to get it out.  Tell her I hope she gets over the trauma of it okay."
9616,Oh my god! I have done something similar before. I don't get embarrassed easy but I know such things do sting a bit!
9617,That is terrible
9618,Police here do that sometimes. It sucks.
9619,I can imagine that. I've never lived alone before.
9620,When did you start living by yourself?
9621,That is great! Being without a job can be very scary
9622,What kind of job is it?
9623,Yu should report him
9624,Well thats what I mean. I hate when people take advantage of others
9625,Oh that could be tough sometimes. I'm glad you were able to get all the ones you wanted.
9626,It's all behind you now.
9627,My neighbors are terrible so I hope you have a good relationship
9628,I actually had some move in a couple of days ago. I have figured them out yet lol
9629,That is doing something. It's what we call relaxing.
9630,Have you been busy lately?
9631,That happens over time
9632,I wonder what my old school looks like now
9633,You should check if they raised your rates unexpectedly or maybe something you bought is eating up a lot of electricity.
9634,"That's terrible, what did you do?"
9635,I hope he learned his lesson.
9636,"yes! Yin and yang, it's hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud :)"
9637,Remember to cherish them as we can all go at any minute :)
9638,"Oh, I love cleaning, so tools to do it with that are new are always welcomed. What kind of brand?"
9639,"A Hoover seems like a reliable choice. My girlfriend is a neat freak, and decided to go with a big purchase, a Dyson, which is more expensive. I've used it and it's not bad. Still not sure I'd pay as much as she did for a vacuum cleaner, but who am I to argue. Anyway, I'm happy for you."
9640,Woah! I'm soooo glad you're okay!  Those big rigs are so dangerous and make me so nervous.  I stay as far away from them as I can.
9641,"Well, that's understandable.  I've had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car.  Was she in shock when you guys were almost hit?"
9642,"I completely understand that.  Things are always scary when it is happening to your kids, but there is hope!  Have you ever heard of whole foods plant based diet?  Or doctor Fuhrman, or doctor Michael Greger?  I think it could heal your son!"
9643,"You will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office, but it can heal almost anything!  I hope your son is better before the end of summer.  Keep hope alive!"
9644,What happened to it?
9645,That sucks.
9646,What are they doing?
9647,"Oh lol, Well it"
9648,"Sorry! I meant that kids do that, enjoy it mom while they are little :)"
9649,I feel sorr for the poor guy!
9650,"Yea, they're his parents. I can imagine everyone being hesitant about telling them what not to do with their own child."
9651,That's nice of you to say about someone else. It's nice when someone can recognize someone else's hard work and dedication without feeling jealous or annoyed. I'm sure he knows how proud of him you are.
9652,"That's a good way to look at it, to use them as motivation and a goal to strive for. Are you in school yourself, or just working?"
9653,Oops.  That's doesn't have to be a bad thing.  No one can resist fries from McDonalds.  How did she react?
9654,"Well, there you go.  She enjoyed it and if she didn't complain or scoff at you, then she sounds like a keeper!"
9655,You must really miss him! So glad you'll finally be reunited with him.
9656,"Oh you have kids, too? They're going to be so happy!"
9657,I've never done that before.
9658,I bet its fun. I cant swim though
9659,IT? Haven't heard of it. What's it about?
9660,Are you thinking about telling her you don't want to see it?
9661,That's a great idea!  For what cause though?
9662,That is very thoughtful of you.
9663,Oh no. That has happened to us so many times. I thought fidh were easy
9664,Wow. Im sorry
9665,People can be inconsiderate sometimes. I hope you don't get sick!
9666,That's true. It's nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.
9667,"Oh man, Costco pizza is great, and so cheap, too. It may not be the best, but for the price and quantity, you can't really beat it. Do you like shopping at Costco often?"
9668,"Yeah, I guess it depends on your household. I just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk. But I think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership. Still, I really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole."
9669,That was so nice of you.  What did they need to use it for?  Were you able to live without it?
9670,What?!! That's terrible.  I don't understand how people don't take care of things that don't belong to them when its a privilege to use borrowed things.  
9671,That is terrible. Some people ar just no good.
9672,I hate that happened to you. I know the feeling too. Someone stole my car from the work parking lot once. I had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it.
9673,Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you don't need to take a side and try to work for peace.
9674,It is rarely easy to know the right thing to do in these sorts of situations.  This might be a situation that calls for some professional help.
9675,"Whoa! Was that a good surprise, or a bad surprise? I could see that going either way, but at least it would be exciting! I had that happen when I got one for Christmas. Well, actually it was in my parent's bed, and I barged into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents, and I saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with."
9676,That's pretty cool! I hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it. Your wife sounds really cool to do that for you.
9677,Did you call her? I hope she's ok!
9678,I'm glad you're going to talk about it instead of being passive aggressive about it.
9679,"Oh, that's kind of nice. It's nice to have those natural landmarks near where you live, so you can visit them and get a sense of relaxation and peace. I've lived near the ocean all my life, and while I do take it for granted from time to time, I try to remember how useful and beautiful it is."
9680,"Sometimes it means increased work commute, or higher costs of living. But sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it. It's all a balance. I'm glad you seem to have found yours!"
9681,that is awesome! 
9682,It will save you a lot of money too
9683,Oh nice. What will you be binge watching?
9684,Hope you find something you like.
9685,She will do great. OR she might not want to have kids be he is such a handful
9686,Lids today are so picky about everything. Its sort of strange. Its nothing like when I was growing up
9687,"That's terrible. Sometimes it's hard to know who your real friends are, and it takes repeated attempts to hang out with them, only to have them bail on you, to realize that you're not valued by them. I say cut your ties sooner rather than later. Life's too short."
9688,"Oh man... When you consider all that, then yeah, definitely cut ties. If they did that to me more than twice, then I would realize really quick that they weren't the type to depend on or waste time on. I feel sorry for you. People should have friends that recognize their worth and be able to respect that relationship. Go out and find you someone who will."
9689,"Wow, that sounds exciting!"
9690,I love a good rock concert!
9691,"Oh god. Someone did pick up their dog's poop, hu?"
9692,It must've been. I hope that never happens to you again.
9693,I bet it did.
9694,Not too many of those around nowadays
9695,oh that was good of you.
9696,oh haha i know that feeling.
9697,thats a good idea.
9698,Thats a bummer
9699,Whos concert?
9700,Nice. Are you excited?
9701,I hope it's what you expected to be!
9702,That is so sweet of your cat.
9703,"Well, I hope you get better soon."
9704,Oh sweet. Sin city! What do you look forward to doing?
9705,Oh yea. I heard the buffets there are amazing.
9706,Good for you.You are an exampler brother.
9707,That is so hard to imagine.She will need all the help she can get from you.
9708,That is great to hear.  Anything in particular?
9709,Cthat sounds amazing!
9710,Oh god that's terrifying haha. I hate snakes.
9711,"I know what you mean, they are cool to look at but if they are near me it spooks me hard."
9712,"That's tough. I have two older brothers, so I know how that is. We're separated by four and eight years, respectively, so we weren't as close as you two seem to be, but I always liked having them around."
9713,"Well, absence always does make the heart grow fonder. It will make your relationship a little strained, but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more. Hopefully his college work doesn't stress him out too much for him to be able to enjoy hanging out."
9714,"Your husband sounds awesome. That's interesting that you're the type of person that actually likes birthday parties. Most people I know would be too embarrassed or self-conscious to enjoy them, and they'd feel uncomfortable. Especially me. But for you, I'm glad you can get into them. "
9715,"Oh, I didn't mean anything about the age! Who cares about that. I'm just a doofus when it comes to social interaction, so I get nervous and avoid things that put attention on me. But I hope you have a lot of fun, especially since your husband went through so much effort. I bet he knows you and what you like well and it will be great."
9716,Oh no!  My gut feels sick for you having to go through that.  It happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward.  How did the neighbors take it?
9717,Its so commendable that you went over and told them right away.  Not everyone would do that.  Your actions increases my faith in the goodness of people.
9718,That is cool.  When did you learn?
9719,That is awesome
9720,Oh that's rare. How come?
9721,Oh now I see lol. Who's your favorite team?
9722,"Oh wow, that's nice of you! What kind?"
9723,I love BMWs. They must've been so happy!
9724,I'm so sorry.  Are you okay?
9725,"Oh goodness, you will find someone better."
9726,Are you exited about it.Do you play the piano.
9727,"Well, there is your chance"
9728,Oh  yea? What's happening this weekend?
9729,That's awesome. How long are you guys going to be there?
9730,That sucks. Did you get a raincheck on your birthday though?
9731,I'm glad they did that for you. So it wasn't all that bad having to work on your birthday then.
9732,Uh oh. Was someone in there?
9733,Oh wow! That is kind of scary.
9734,That's good to have land you own.
9735,Privacy is so important to have sometimes.
9736,That isn't cool.  Is there anyone else that sells it?
9737,That's great.  What is the good news?
9738,I am very happy for you!
9739,Oh me too! I heard it will be the last one.
9740,Me too! I hope we both enjoy it a lot!
9741,Good for you. I always had communication problems with my parents 
9742,"Yes, you should,You are very lucky."
9743,You and me both my friend
9744,I know it is so disturbing
9745,"That is great, how long has it been since?"
9746,Well I hope you have fun!
9747,That’s awesome!  Is she a good one?
9748,I am really glad to hear that. 
9749,That was nice. I just recenlt had a baby. It was amazing!
9750,Thanks! What band did yall see?
9751,That's interesting. What makes you confident? 
9752,Ah I see. That would be a good guess then.
9753,Is there a reason.Are you expecting bad news?
9754,I am sure you are prepared for this interview.
9755,What did you see?
9756,Wow! That is a miracle!
9757,Good luck in your camping.I hope you have a lot of fun.
9758,You are going to ace that interview
9759,What are you planning?
9760,That sounds really fun. Hopefully you have some help.
9761,What do you think?
9762,Why? What did they do?
9763,I understand your frustration.
9764,Really?? You probably were been very scared.
9765,What kind of ghost it was?
9766,Inclined to do what?
9767,That is cool.  How did you do?
9768,Yes! sometimes I like such gatherings
9769,Ha ha ha. yes indeed!
9770,Why would they do that?
9771,Man did you say anything?
9772,That was really sweet of him!
9773,"Oh that's so bad. But, at least you realized your mistake. You are a good person."
9774,"Yes, I did.I t was a great game."
9775,Are you kidding?? They were the favorites all the way.
9776,What are you afraid of?
9777,"Wow, that sounds terrible."
9778,Are you happy for him or jealous?
9779,"Well,if he really is your friend you shouldn't."
9780,ohh! why?
9781,Yes! that's very bad. I don't like it either
9782,Did you miss someone or a place maybe.?
9783,I am sorry to hear that.I am sure he is in a better place.
9784,What is the reason? Did he get a great job offer?
9785,Families move all the time.The kids will be fine.
9786,Oh wow! That is very impressive!
9787,I'm sorry to hear that.  Will you dog be okay?
9788,I wish only the best for him.
9789,I love scary movies. What was it?  Was it good?
9790,That’s fun though
9791,oh wow i hope it went well for him that takes a lot of courage.
9792,that is really great.
9793,"Wow, that is really gross."
9794,I can sympathize with you.
9795,Congratulations.You must be very proud of her.
9796,I am sure she will graduate with honors and get a great job
9797,That is not good. What seems to be the cause?
9798,I am so sorry. That must be very difficult.
9799,Oh really? Why would you be scared?
9800,I see. A war would be horrible.
9801,I am sorry to hear that.What is the reason for this?
9802,I am sorry to hear that.Do you have full cover insurance.
9803,"that really sucks, i dont know the feeling tho."
9804,she sounds like a rude person.
9805,"Oh that's cool, how long did the graduation last?"
9806,"That's a little annoying, since you just have to sit there and wait for it to end haha."
9807,"That is cool, sounds like a good time."
9808,I totally agree with you. He's great!
9809,I can not disagree with you.
9810,I am sorry to hear that.We you expecting somthing very expensive?
9811,Did you get in touch with  the postal office?
9812,oh thats a weird thing to say.
9813,saying you are scary is weird tho???
9814,I am sorry to hear that.Following a diet is very stresffull.
9815,You probably need to get more motivated.
9816,I'm so sorry.  Will you be okay?
9817,I hope you will feel better.
9818,Do you watch any other shows?
9819,Will you be hosting a Thanksgiving party at your home?
9820,Does your Mother's house have any animals?
9821,When did you find out?
9822,I guess she didn't get a cat then.
9823,It is good to stay informed.
9824,I am glad people still pay attention to the outside world.
9825,"That is very bad, you should return it."
9826,When did you do it?
9827,That's good. What kind of parade was it?
9828,Oh my gosh! I would have been so mad. Did you call them and complain? They need to fix it.
9829,That is a good thing. I am sure you are a great mom.
9830,"I do have kids. Being a mom can be hard, but it is so rewarding."
9831,"That's a shame, you shouldn't have to do that."
9832,Things will get better soon.
9833,Did you call the manager and complain?
9834,You should of called and told them.
9835,"I'm sorry, how do you feel?"
9836,I hope you can forgive yourself.
9837,Do you talk softly?
9838,You should tell them.
9839,It is great to have a brother you can count.
9840,I am sure he can also count on you for everything
9841,How long have you been married?
9842,Do you have any children?
9843,I am sure you looked just fine.
9844,I am sure it was not that bad.
9845,Did you take the offer?
9846,That was nice of him.
9847,Oh no that is horrible. Is he okay?
9848,I hope he can do so quickly!
9849,Why do you feel at peace?
9850,What did you do with them?
9851,wow thats crazy.
9852,i bet it was with something like that.
9853,I am so happy for you!
9854,Did you go on any rides?
9855,I think he is doing a great job.
9856,"No, I am well educated. He lowered taxes. "
9857,Really?.You are a loser
9858,You should better yourself and fix this situation.
9859,That is very nice of her.
9860,That's nice you can rely on her.
9861,That wasn't very nice.
9862,You should return it.
9863,"Oh wow, that's exciting!"
9864,"I'm also going to college in the fall, but I'm gonna be a sophomore."
9865,How did she dump you?
9866,Will you still be friends with her?
9867,oh wow that is awesome.
9868,yea i bet it does.
9869,Did she not get it?
9870,Will she apply elsewhere?
9871,It is unacceptable for a friendship. I think you should not behave in such a way ever again
9872,You should. You must immediately let your friend know and apologize for your behavior
9873,That is a very nice gesture by them.
9874,You must have some great people in your life.
9875,You should sue them.
9876,"Oh no, what did you steal?"
9877,That is not right.  Do you feel bad?
9878,"Really? That's amazing, what words?"
9879,"That's really exciting, I'm happy for you."
9880,Did they laugh at you?
9881,oh thats so cool.
9882,i bet you were so happy.
9883,That was smart of you.
9884,You would be a good planner.
9885,Did you do it in person?
9886,You should of done it in person.
9887,"Don't worry, you will be fine."
9888,Just have faith and everything will work out.
9889,That is good that you are happy about his efforts. 
9890,I guess it depends on what the next couple of years hold.
9891,That is nice of them.
9892,You are well prepared.
9893,That's good. Anything special happening?
9894,"Ah, so you feel confident about it?"
9895,When is she coming?
9896,How long is she staying?
9897,"I've never had to do it before, have you?"
9898,"I'm sure it was, I hope the next time isn't as bad for you."
9899,Did you expect it?
9900,There are other girls out there.
9901,When do you get the grade?
9902,"I'm sorry, why did you get fired?"
9903,Things will work out if you stay positive.
9904,Do you live in a place where it regularly rains? 
9905,"As it is summer, i was a bit surprised to see raining in your place"
9906,oh my gosh i completely agree on the loneliness thing
9907,i dont to be honest just try to get through the day but ive never been in a relationship so it gets bad
9908,"oh my, was it worth it?"
9909,what a joke! are you going to sue?
9910,"That's okay, she will forgive you."
9911,What did you do with it?
9912,I have never played that game.
9913,How old are you
9914,"Oh damn, you had cancer before?"
9915,"I'm sure it was, hopefully it's gone for good."
9916,"oh yea im the same, gonna be wild."
9917,"oh thats awesome, you are a good person, we need more booze people"
9918,Did you watch TV?
9919,What do you watch on netflix?
9920,I love it too! It's really fancy.
9921,I know right! It's weird how it's faster than a gasoline car.
9922,Did you run away?
9923,Did you kill it?
9924,Is this your first home?
9925,How big is the house?
9926,Good for you. Many are getting into car loan and struggling with car payments
9927,You should be grateful for having such a caring father
9928,I hope you do too!
9929,Hard work always pays off.
9930,Will he let you drive it?
9931,That is so sweet of you> I am sure that makes her so happy.
9932,You are making memories that will last a lifetime.
9933,What are you going to do while he is away?
9934,Will you be able to call him?
9935,oh thats a very big position.
9936,dang thats shooting high
9937,Who invited you?
9938,Are you going to accept the invite?
9939,I wish I was also tall. It must be nice.
9940,That would be very helpful.
9941,How long did you have it for?
9942,Can you buy a new one?
9943,I am sure your hard work will pay off!
9944,It is always a good thing to stay optimistic.
9945,That is wonderful. Is he now considering going to college?
9946,Good for him. Has he taken any SAT tests yet?
9947,"I'm sorry, are you jealous?"
9948,You will find a good career.
9949,Did they have permission to take it?
9950,I hope you can learn to forgive them for it. 
9951,oh no! did you block your cards?
9952,what are you going to do about it?
9953,I'm happy about that. Got a party planned?
9954,You seem very excited. I hope it turns out the way you want it to.
9955,eww thats awful.
9956,i bet it was.
9957,That sounds like fun!
9958,I'm sure you had a good time!
9959,That sounds like you were confident in your decision. Did you think it through?
9960,That sounds like you were happy with the decision that you made. 
9961,"Why your parents? Can't you buy it yourself, all on your own like a grown ups?"
9962,I am sorry to hear that. I think you should join your parents when they go shopping for a pet to a store
9963,I really love those types of shows. Remember what it was called?
9964,"Oh cool, I've never watched that one before!"
9965,"Physics is an interesting subject, but it can get difficult to understand sometimes."
9966,Hopefully you won't have to take an additional Physics course in the future!
9967,Well that's not very nice! Why'd you do that?!
9968,I would sure hope so! That poor kid.
9969,That sounds like a fun project!
9970,Patience is always a good thing.
9971,Why did you have to do that?
9972,Oh I bet that was embarrassing. I have had that happen too.
9973,When and where is his first solo concert?
9974,"Fantastic, I imagine you must be so proud."
9975,oh that really suckks.
9976,i see what you mean i would be too
9977,That sounds like a fun night.
9978,I am happy for you.
9979,did he get you?
9980,they do look a little scary! 
9981,"Oh thats great, good work."
9982,oh yea i work out a lot and im no where close so you must work hard
9983,Did you do it on purpose?
9984,"You've got to be careful, that can cause a very serious accident!"
9985,Really? lol
9986,It will be
9987,Are you okay?
9988,I'm glad you didn't get hurt.
9989,oh no. are you at an elevated area?
9990,always good to be prepared
9991,Congrats! That is a good feeling.
9992,Your hard work is paying off! Keep it up.
9993,"I'm afraid of public speaking or performing in crowds, so that takes courage! How did it go?"
9994,That's great! You have to keep a good attitude about it. I hope you get the part you want!
9995,can you even find one like that now?
9996,definitely good old days!
9997,That's really impressive! Education is really important.
9998,That's cool. It's good to be supportive of your friends.
9999,"thats scary, i hate that stuff."
10000,haha thats quite funny
10001,I am sure it does. It is same for me. I was also raised in the 90s.
10002,Yes it was. I miss that time in my life.
10003,That sounds amazing! I love it when families adopt and give a loving child a home.
10004,"That's so sweet!! I see you said she was a baby, but how old is she currently? "
10005,Oh cool! What part of Texas were you going to check out?
10006,"Yes, the beaches there would be really fun to go explore. Plus lots of sight seeing!"
10007,thats horrible so sad :/
10008,"i bet it is, so sad."
10009,thats nice of you but so hard to deal with
10010,That's good to hear he's doing so well. Did you have a lot of input?
10011,Teachers? Well it's not always the case. I never let school interfere with my education
10012,Is there something specific that you are scared about?
10013,Slow down. Do not jump into such conclusions so fast. I highly recommend you to immediately reach out to a doctor
10014,Really.Did anybody get hurt.
10015,Do you have full cover on you car?
10016,So sorry to hear that. It's not easy
10017,Well done. I'm sure she'll appreciate it
10018,"That does sound boring because you had no one to interact with, but at least you had some privacy."
10019,I see. It would be quite lonely without a roommate to share the experience with.
10020,thats so nice of you.
10021,i bet it is.
10022,I have never had an accident. Been driving for 22 years now
10023,Trash cans? How odd. Maybe you should complain to the city
10024,Maybe it is your imagination.The were probably catching up.
10025,You should not be so insecure about your partner.It is not healthy.
10026,"It seems under Trump, the economy is booming as he promised"
10027,"Indeed. Many thought that way, but he actually delivered on his promises"
10028,That is sad. Did he pass away?
10029,I bet it does. I am so sorry. Try to think of all the good times with him.
10030,Did she.How did it go?
10031,Congratulations.You probably are very proud of her.
10032,"Me either,  they have done so much for me in my life."
10033,"wow, thats so nice.  there are alot of people in life who have no one."
10034,Yes there are. It is so sad.
10035,It is difficult when we all have busy lives and limited resources.
10036,oh no. how many people do you think noticed?
10037,funny how nobody told you about it
10038,I bet that is really enjoyable. Are you going anywhere fun?
10039,Have fun! That sounds like a great time.
10040,"Oh, that sounds rough. Were you successful?"
10041,That's great! I'm happy for you. I hope you get along real well
10042,Sounds rough. Did it do any major damage?
10043,Good! I'm glad it worked out for you guys at least
10044,You must have been overjoyed. I know what he meant to you.
10045,Be sure and put it in a safe place.
10046,Well that's not right no matter what your excuse because now you're not trustworthy see
10047,It's better to end things than to wait for years. Don't waste any more time like I did. 4 years
10048,That's always good to hear. What's going on?
10049,That sounds like a fun time! Enjoy!
10050,That sounds like it is exciting but also a lot of work. 
10051,Wow how kind of her! You are lucky to have such a good mom.
10052,"wow, And did you ever end up finishing the project?"
10053,"I see,  what did you do instead"
10054,Sometimes I do
10055,"I'm not sure what you mean, but disntance does tend to make things more difficult"
10056,"That's hard, but he will be back! Try to take your mind off him by doing some fun activities"
10057,That's horrible!  This is why they say never a lender nor a borrower be..
10058,I hope it wasn't a lot of money.  Sometimes it takes a hard lesson to learn whom to let in your life.
10059,Sorry to hear.  Will you be planning anything special?
10060,"If you have other family member around you, ask around and get everyone involved.  It should be nice."
10061,I bet that was a nice surprise.
10062,That is so cool. 
10063,"Wow, how are you adjusting?"
10064,Have you tried to go out and make friends?
10065,I'm so sorry to hear that. I love my dog
10066,He can live on in memories perhaps
10067,who did?
10068,did you like what she bought?
10069,Really? That is a crazy thing to do
10070,Did anything happen to him?
10071,I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have the files backed up at all?
10072,"Wow, that's so lucky! I should do that as well just in case!"
10073,"Aw, that's adorable! I bet he's the cutest thing"
10074,That's awesome. I want a baby nephew :(
10075,I can understand your feelings. That's a tough situation.
10076,"That is good that you trust him, but temptation is never good for anyone."
10077,That's really tough.  But one closed door leads to the next great opportunity.
10078,That's horrible!  If you don't have insurance there are a lot of pro bono lawyers that will take your case.  Report it to the police so it is documented and justice will prevail.  You don't deserve or need to put up with that.
10079,What a nice gift! My little brother did the same for me actually. Xbox one S last year
10080,Oh yes. Got like 400 games on it.
10081,"Knew who, exactly?"
10082,Someone randomly walked up to you and kissed you? That's odd
10083,Really? Why did you do that?
10084,OK
10085,When will she be returning?
10086,How are you keeping yourself occupied?
10087,Wow that sounds like a lot of fun!
10088,What was your favorite part of the trip?
10089,Oh yeah? What is it?
10090,Oh my days lol. That's a classic. I like 2 stupid dogs myself
10091,Has she taught him to sit?
10092,"wow she must be a really good dog owner, is this her first?"
10093,That had to make you feel good. It is so easy to forget when your trying so hard to remember. LOL
10094,I always make a list before a trip and triple check it before I leave.
10095,That's terrible!  How did you find out?
10096,It's hard to find forgiveness for something like that.  Still it's better that he confessed than you having to find out otherwise.  If only a little better/
10097,Congratulation. How it went?
10098,That is very nice. Congratulation.
10099,Oh no! I hate that happened and I bet it was scary because it looked like someone broke in. But now you have a repair bill. Sorry that happened to you.
10100,I hope the person's conscience makes them feel guilty and they come clean about the situation! And hopefully reimburse you!
10101,Sounds like fun. What you got planned ?
10102,Got any family out there? Cousins perhaps
10103,"What kind is it, Cuban?"
10104,"Cool, I like those, but they are crazy expensive, if you want a thick one."
10105,Why you don't invite a friend to come with you?
10106,Why don't you take a guide or a book to help visit?
10107,Oh no I am so sorry. Did you have flood insurance at least?
10108,Did you lose anything you can't replace? Important documents or pictures? Must be some bright light.
10109,"i bet, sounds like it would be nice."
10110,yea but exams can still really suckk
10111,"Movies can be emotional, do you remember the film?"
10112,"That's a good movie. Yes, time really goes by fast and those memories remind us of the good times."
10113,Did succeed at anything?
10114,Wow that's so cool! Which comics were they?
10115,Oh yeah that would be such a fun find!
10116,"Sweet, where abouts are you going?"
10117,"No doubt, do you have a tour guide or is it just free for you to roam about?"
10118,What about 5?
10119,I still have no idea what do you mean?
10120,"Oh god, that's awful! Is she alright?"
10121,"That would make sense, assuming she is getting pretty old."
10122,"Oh no, did she say something really upsetting?"
10123,Oh that's the worst...I wish people would just say what they want to say
10124,oh do you have summer classes?
10125,"eh its not bad, its quite productive "
10126,Man that sounds like the dream. Watching anything good?
10127,The British version of the U.S. version? 
10128,Not my pick but I am glad you get a laugh out of it.
10129,Oh my gosh. Why did your pants fall?
10130,Were you able to laugh it off or were you so mortified you wanted to crawl out of the room?
10131,I understand. Were you able to manage the situation?
10132,It is ok. It was a scary situation.
10133,What kind of problems?
10134,Do you have enough time for it?
10135,"Why, what did he tell you?"
10136,"She must really be a good friend, how are you repaying here?"
10137,Is it a type of work you've been wanting to get into for a while?
10138,"Wow, engineering, sounds impressive.  I'm sure the income will be awesome."
10139,That sounds great! What are you growing?
10140,That sounds delicious and healthy also.
10141,It's nice to be able to look back. It can really give you perspective on your life now.
10142,That is so true. After all we can't change the past only learn from it.
10143,Why would they do such a thing?
10144,"That is so bad, the police should be called for that."
10145,Those kind of thing happened from time to time.
10146,oh yea i know the feeling
10147,oof thats harsh i feel for you
10148,yea its insane that hes a political figure
10149,yea and immigarants
10150,"That is disgusting, What did you do to clean it?"
10151,Did the smell went away?
10152,"Family members are awesome, what was the situation? "
10153,I am glad everything turned out alright!
10154,I bet you are happy as never before.
10155,You are lucky that your girlfriend is a gamer.
10156,Good for them for taking the initiative and helping the family.
10157,You must of done something right in raising them. 
10158,Why would you do such a thing?!
10159,"That is unacceptable, find a job!"
10160,That's great. What made you feel that.
10161,"That's a great feeling, I don't like having any kind of bill anyway."
10162,Did you got the grade?
10163,That is nice. Congratulation.
10164,thats horrible
10165,oh thats nice
10166,"That is so weird, maybe try contacting them and see what happened. Sorry to hear."
10167,Oh no. Did it run off or stay close by?
10168,Hopefully he didn't get hurt. It might be time to put a lock on the gate.
10169,who saved you?
10170,well that was observant of her.. sometimes people dont even notice 
10171,I bet you were happy
10172,That is always nice
10173,What was the name of the movie?
10174,I know this movie but it seems a nice movie. What did it reminded you from your childhood?
10175,What did you do
10176,I am not sure what you picked up
10177,wow that's nice 
10178,yeah i can  imagine
10179,"I wish you luck in that, the chances of winning the lottery are super slim!"
10180,Never give up hope. I like your thinking.
10181,"I am too, it looks good"
10182,That has been fun
10183,That is very nice of your aunt. What kind of laptop was it?
10184,I have dells are really reliable! 
10185,thats gross
10186,yea i wouldnt either
10187,That is very nice. In which industry did you get your job?
10188,I didn't understand you.
10189,i believe i am
10190,Rightly said! It always comes in handy!
10191,oh wow i couldnt even imagine
10192,yuk
10193,I hope you were no too upset.  The odd of winning are super low!
10194,That is a good outlook to have.  A little chance is better than no chance!
10195,Aw really? He is a great player anyways
10196,Hopefully he continues his streak at LA as well
10197,"Hopefully so, he is not making it easy for them or anyone!"
10198,"Apparently everyone is our enemy now, how sad!"
10199,"Aww, what happened? You missed something emergency?"
10200,So sorry to hear that man.. i hope you get to go very soon
10201,How hopeful.. I will make sure to pray for you guys. best wishes
10202,I really hope you guys get it
10203,What don't you like about the cars?
10204,"That could be possible, make sure you watch out during the night time!"
10205,Thats a good attitude to have. Did you do well?
10206,Awesome! So happy for you my friend
10207,"Aww, did you miss your plans?"
10208,Sorry to hear that my friend.. hopefully it works out better next time
10209,I would have to loved to see that btw! Do you dance with friends or alone?
10210,I can understand that. You are more passionate than others
10211,Try not to be too envious!  What kind of car is it that you want so bad?
10212,I guess you can just start trying to save for it.  Don't be jealous or it will eat you up inside!
10213,I understand how you feel. I wonder how those people afford it.
10214,I'm sure if you work hard you could afford it too.
10215,oh no.. what happened?
10216,Sorry to hear that my friend. I hope things work out for you at work soon enough
10217,Oh that would be awesome! How much is the lottery for?
10218,I really hope you get it buddy
10219,Sorry to hear that.. Did you miss something important?
10220,Oh shoot.. I wish you get to go soon enough buddy
10221,oh cool buddy.. how much did you win?
10222,"Alright, anyways good for you!"
10223,"No, I missed it, but I do usually watch UFC fights!  Were there quick knock outs?"
10224,Knock outs are the best!  When was UFC established?  I feel like it was been around for a while!
10225,That is insane.  You might want to take it elsewhere.
10226,The prices have risen alot with all the technology and electrical components.
10227,Oh no. I can't imagine not having AC in this heat.
10228,I hope you can get it fixed easily. I know they are not cheap to replace.
10229,Good reason to be scared.  What steps are you both taking to increase security?
10230,A good sound plan.  You're right it is a father's responsibility to protect his family.
10231,I found a bunch of dead mice few days ago
10232,Haha.. thats a really funny story!
10233,That sounds like a nice plan.  Do you often get the chance to take days off?
10234,I've been thinking of forcing myself to take time off.  We all need a break from time to time.
10235,Friends and UFC sounds like a great night!  I missed the fight.  Were there any good knock outs?
10236,Awesome!  Was that who you were hoping would win?
10237,I hope you get it too!  Best of luck!  We all could use extra money in the pocket!
10238,Sounds promising.  Are you coming out of long dry spell?
10239,"That's pretty short.  I went 7 years.  Decided the next girl I met I'd marry, we just celebrated 13 years toghether."
10240,Holy cow that's awesome for you!  How are you feeling today?
10241,That's amazing.  Did something happen recently that made you happy?
10242,Awesome!  You must be excited!  Where are you going?
10243,I am sure he will!  Florida is a great place to visit!
10244,Oh no. Did it eat something bad?
10245,I'm sure she is okay. My dog throws up randomly too sometimes.
10246,oh cool.. Is it in the field you like?
10247,Good for you :) I wish and pray you get it buddy
10248,did any competition have you attend in pool 
10249,that good it makes you healthy 
10250,That's a good way of saying live a good life.
10251,Treat everyone the way you want to be treated.
10252,That is impressive. Which law school have you applied?
10253,I have a friend who recently graduated from there and have landed a job in a law firm
10254,Ouch.  Debt ration does play a big factor in the scoring.
10255,(*ratio)  I watch my score like a hawk.
10256,damn.. what did you do?
10257,haha.. did you find the friends?
10258,I know your pain. I used to have to stay over often as well.
10259,It sucks when your wife made said plans hahaha!
10260,You have to have a good friend though for any help. Without a friend there is not help.
10261,You are lucky to have a friend willing to help.
10262,in every office the coworker are really good and fast
10263,coworker can help you in different situation 
10264,"Yeah, where did you go?"
10265,"Wow, that is a pretty awesome place to go!"
10266,What pet did you get?
10267,"Oh wow, that is gonna be  anew experience for you!"
10268,"Yikes, how much will it cost to replace?"
10269,"That would be best, they can get expensive to fix"
10270,That's sad to hear.
10271,It is. I've lost both of mine.  It will get better with time.
10272,"I would have peed myself, what did you do?"
10273,"Oh, that is a smart move, I would have been just as scare"
10274,and... ?  what is going on?
10275,Oh ok.. I was scared for a minute there.  Congratulations on your successful relationship! LOL
10276,I know what you mean. My family is the only thing that keeps me going.
10277,"Its tough, but hey at least it's something."
10278,What did she ask for?
10279,"Well that is a very expensive gift, she cannot expect to get stuff that costs so much!"
10280,oh when does it come out .. we just got mario aces.. it was ok 
10281,i hope so
10282,"I completely understand. Can't live with them, can't live without them.  ha ha ha"
10283,How long you been together?
10284,What fight did you watch?
10285,"Ah, did he win?"
10286,"I am the black sheep in mine, self declared."
10287,"No he didn't.. but at least they were admitting they were assholes, you didn't have to wait till you were older to figure it out."
10288,"I absolutely love the casino,  what is your slot machine of choice?"
10289,"I love the one dollar slots, but I always loose everything"
10290,How rude!  Are you two roommates?
10291,What was it that he ate?
10292,Yes I love combat sports.
10293,"Dillishaw is a warrior,  Do you think very highly of connor?"
10294,"I am sorry to hear that, I lost my grandmother to cancer, which did not make it anny better, knowing it was coming"
10295,"I know, it is sad that people must pass, but I am grateful for the time I did get with her"
10296,"Ive always wanted a nintendo switch, Is it any good?"
10297,How often do you play portably?
10298,Yeah kids have moved on to YuGiYoh and other silly games.
10299,At least pokemon go is popular now..
10300,"Wow, that should be interesting, have fun!"
10301,did you kill it ?
10302,"Why, what happened?"
10303,"That makes sense, you gotta prepare for that my man, you know how that goes!"
10304,"I love the switch, I have been thinking about buying my own."
10305,Would you say you play it more at home or on the go?
10306,"That is amazing, what breed was it?"
10307,"That is so great, did you keep it?"
10308,that's good that you trust her! It's hard to have a relationship if you don't have trust
10309,i agree! I've been married for 5 years and i can't imagine being with anyone else but my wife
10310,"That is good, it can be easy to sink into a bad lifestyle with a kid or stressed wife"
10311,"That makes sense too, that is all I eat now, my metabolism may catch me one day, I need to make changes as well, but great for you losing the weight!"
10312,I do that too.. I take small tiny ones usually.  I have pieces of the grandcanyon and everything
10313,"Sometimes but I like natural cool stuff better, and making collages out of brochures and free stuff I find along the way."
10314,WHAT?! do you hear noises at night?
10315,"Oh, my, god, I have lived in a haunted house before,  what do you smell?"
10316,what happened ? lost it?
10317,What happened? did you run into traffic?
10318,"That is no fun,  was his coach upset he was late, or did you even make it at all?"
10319,"NO! they can be vermin,  what did you do to get rid of him?"
10320,Did he jump up and run away?
10321,That was nice of him..  Did you pay him back ever
10322,THats really nice of you!  Was he surprised?
10323,WHAT? I would be terrified!! 
10324,So you actually saw it?? how did it look? did it say anything?
10325,Has she tried to lie before but just been a terrible liar?
10326,"I am the same way, Every time I lie im thinking.  they dont believe me at all"
10327,that's good. did it actually turn out easy?
10328,that's wonderful! Congrats! I didn't have a lot of easy classes when i was in college
10329,"Moving to a new place can make you uneasy, but once you make a couple of friends you'll get over it. "
10330,"New York is very beautiful and the people there are very friendly, so i'm sure you'll do fine. "
10331,"Oh, wow!  What happened?  "
10332,That stinks.  What did you do with your tickets?
10333,why not? if it will possibly get you better
10334,might as well find out now before it get worse
10335,Good luck. That's always nerve racking waiting for them to call. I'm sure you did well though.
10336,"That is really exciting. I bet since you have a good feeling, they will call back."
10337,What band is that?
10338,They playing anywhere close?
10339,thats good.. any plans
10340,how long have you been driving
10341,ah thats cool
10342,"Wait, what happened?"
10343,How did he manage to open the gate?
10344,"That's good, new experiences can lead to new likes and dislikes. The important thing is that you keep an open mind. "
10345,"Exactly, hopefully you found a new hobby."
10346,That was really nice of them and lucky they were able to help you.
10347,Congratulations on graduating college and I wish you the very best.
10348,That's cool! Do you play basketball frequently?
10349,"I feel the same. I used to be pretty athletic, but now I take in most sports from the comfort of my sofa!"
10350,"I would try again, if you love her you might regret not giving it another try if she moves on."
10351,Sounds like a good idea to go slow and make sure things don't get too heavy too fast.
10352,"I dont have kids either, sometimes when i go out with my friends im mainly the 3rd wheel and it feels weird , i feel your pain"
10353,"Thats exactly how i feel, i have hanged out with them and its always kids crying and running around"
10354,Great! Will this mean a lower car payment for you? 
10355,So happy for you! Yes- having extra money is always a reason to celebrate!
10356,Did you guys ever fall out?
10357,"Wow, it's always the people that your closest to that end up changing."
10358,That must have been so frustrating!!! Were you able to find them fairly quickly? And how?!
10359,"SO frustrating. Hopefully you were able to provide feedback to the owner. Not sure they could/can *do* anything about it, but still -- maybe you've helped pay it forward to the next visitor!"
10360,That's terrific! Is there anything in particular that makes you feel good about it?
10361,"But on a personal level, how do you experience that?"
10362,"Language barriers can be pretty problematic. Always keep an open ear, though."
10363,That's fair. The same would be true in any other nation.
10364,You are so lucky! I love the Caribbean but I have never been to Barbados. Have you been there before?
10365,Saint Lucia is absolutely beautiful. You were very lucky to go there.
10366,"Try to relax and think positive, visualize yourself acing the test."
10367,"You are being to negative.Whit this attitude, you are gonna fail for sure"
10368,"It seems he is delivering on his promises. As you can see, the economic numbers are truly high"
10369,I think the tax cuts has made investors bullish on capital investment which Trump administration has passed as a law
10370,"Nice, I bet you feel so relieved!"
10371,"I agree, second chances are awesome. They always surprise me because I don't expect much after the first chance."
10372,"Oh wow, I bet that's scary. Maybe there's something you could look into to help prevent that happening, that does not sound fun!"
10373,"I agree, get those things OUT! I hope they never come back!"
10374,oh when and why?
10375,"oh my condolences for you, you would have good memories of it."
10376,Ha! I've always loved the more festive Dia de los Muertos approach to the day rather than scare or gore! What's your favorite Halloween film?
10377,"SAME. Because when it came out, it felt groundbreaking! I remember being soooo scared and jumpy for weeks after seeing that."
10378,I did not know that it was that high! That's amazing.
10379,"I guess so, and I am not even a Trump supporter."
10380,I bet that disturbing and frightening when you have to see those. Especially when the thought of them is always lingering!
10381,Hopefully you don't wake up and ruin your sleep over them too often.
10382,Nice! You sound like you prepared very well
10383,"I love that feeling. Being prepared for whatever comes your way, good luck!"
10384,it definetly is. I'm glad schools are taking a stance against it
10385,it definetly is. I hope we move forward to eliminate this issue
10386,Sounds a bit scary.  What did you do?
10387,Oh my goodness I would have been terrified!
10388,Thankfully he walked on past you but what a horrible experience all round.
10389,Making music is a hard business to break into. The only way to make it is to keep practicing and to get a little lucky.
10390,"Even if nothing ever comes of music, you're still having fun I hope! Thats really what music is supposed to be about anyways. Making a few million is always a nice bonus though!"
10391,Of course. Good luck with the music career. I'm rooting for you
10392,"Wow, that's awesome and great that you're supporting her also."
10393,What course or field?
10394,what happened?
10395,"Oh my, I hope you are ok."
10396,"Cool, do you like older cars?"
10397,Was there any bikes there too?
10398,Oh wow. I bet that was amazing!
10399,I bet the weather was nice too!
10400,oh that sounds good 
10401,ya you should and you be proud of your achievement 
10402,That's a wild occurrence. Jail can be harsh on anyone.
10403,Yeah that's definitely the way to go. Get out as fast as possible.
10404,Oh no! That's disgusting. They should take better care of him.
10405,I would have been nauseous too.
10406,Is bed rest where you stop working?
10407,"Me too. If she gets plenty of rest, the baby will be just fine."
10408,sounds like a lot of waiting. did you do well?
10409,very frustating but congratulations on the results
10410,"Hey, that's good I hope both do a lot of catching up 😊"
10411,"I haven't been to the zoo in a long time, I hope you have fun."
10412,"Oh man, did you have plenty of food and water?"
10413,Dang well its a good thing that you made it out okay!
10414,"Don't worry, I do that all the time. I love binge eating lol"
10415,True but chips taste sooo much better
10416,It's awful when you spend money on tickets and popcorn and it's a bad time. Did they put all of the best moments in the trailer?
10417,I would be so annoyed. You could have stayed home and watched Twitch.
10418,That's great! I hope you perform well and have a wonderful time. What is your profession?
10419,Just take a few deep breathes and be confident!
10420,That sounds like a great deal. Get the money and do something great with it.
10421,Hopefully all goes well. We could use a little cash.
10422,I have not seen any UFC movies. I guess I should watch one to give them a chance.
10423,Who are some of your favorite fighters?
10424,That's terrible maybe getting out of the house and checking out our yard sale will cheer you up. 
10425,no problem! Hope to see you 
10426,That's unfortunate. I have experienced similar things. I hope that she comes back around.
10427,"Yeah, it is. But just realize that you are not the one acting weird."
10428,Nice! Usually Mondays suck but not for you! You are so lucky
10429,Make the best of it! 
10430,"Ugh, I am with you on that. Mine has been doing that all week. It's so annoying and it costs even more to switch to someone else"
10431,"Sometimes resetting the modem & router helps. But, it won't do much if the ISP isn't good to begin with. Careful with going too cheap, though, you might end up worse"
10432,Every adult has some nostalgic feelings of becoming a child again. Adult responsibilities are overwhelming
10433,"Indeed. Growing up, i now realize how much my parents have sacrificed in order to provide for me"
10434,Good luck! Hard work always pays off. 
10435,"Yes, you will coquer that exam!"
10436,That's great! What strategies are you using?
10437,Have you heard of the ketogenic diet? I am thinking about going on it.
10438,"It is one where fats are 75% of the diet, protein is 20%, and carbohydrates are 5%. It's very difficult to do, but I think I am going to do it. You should look it up to see what it is all about"
10439,"That's probably true, but who knows in this country."
10440,"I hope so. I think he will be out, but apparently his approval rating has gone up."
10441,Awe I am so sorry to hear that.  What happened?
10442,I imagine so.  The holidays are the times we really miss those who are no longer with us.  I hope in time though you can remember the happy times and the good memories you have made with her over the years.
10443,LOVE the mountains. Mainly in the New Mexico / Colorado area -- but also to the Alps. How about you?
10444,Lovely! Did you ski or sled? Sledding is a whoooooole different animal there!
10445,That is such a bummer. Summer is an expensive time to travel. I went to Ireland in July but I bought the tickets in March so they were pretty cheap. 
10446,"Oh that is so frustrating. I'm sorry to hear that. I am a travel agent- flight prices fluctuate by the hour- keep watching, they might go back down. "
10447,That's exciting!  I can't imagine getting upset over a surprise trip though!
10448,I would be thrilled!  I think it's a great idea
10449,That's probably great for your body and fitness.
10450,That's great. Keep up the wonderful work. Do you diet well too?
10451,Uh oh. For fun or you needed it for something?
10452,"Oh, I see. Well we all think differently about things we reflect on later. Use it as a personal lesson for other things in life"
10453,"well, something must have gone wrong somehow, I think you should talk to your vet doctor"
10454,Yes I think you can try chaining it
10455,oh that was so sad.don't fed up.you have to go through this problem
10456,please don't worry .you have to be so confident in these times.keep going whatever happens
10457,that's my duty friend.you have the power to defeat your problems.make it soon
10458,"Wow, what the heck. Tell your chief it was your assistant who did it"
10459,That is absolutely amazing. That could be an inspiration to so many different people.
10460,You know that almost sounds like that could be a movie. There are so many people caught up with drugs today in the United States and around the world
10461,"Oh, I'm so sorry! Do you want to talk about it?"
10462,Argh! Was it an accident of some kind? I hope YOU are okay!
10463,I love them too. What kind of dog do you have?
10464,"Awww, I bet they are. I don't have a dog right now but I want one. I just don't know what breed yet."
10465,"Wow, that is messed up. Why did your boss change mind so suddenly?"
10466,I guess that makes sense but still. I would have been furious and let them know I had a vacation planned.
10467,Try to put yourself out there!  You can also try online dating!
10468,Never stop trying!  There are plenty of fish in the sea!
10469,woow that is good of her. encourage her to keep shinning
10470,i love lawyers too especially the serious ones as they know how to bring back justice
10471,"wow, what happened?"
10472,I'm so sorry to hear about that
10473,That's great. The community aspect of church is fun.
10474,"Yes, that's probably true. I bet they are very happy, too."
10475,I feel you.I am that way to.I fear public speaking.
10476,I t is an strong feeling for sure.
10477,Sometimes revisiting the past is great for personal reflection. Maybe contact those people sometime.
10478,That's great! I bet she loved to hear your voice.
10479,"Thats unfortunate. Sometimes, people don't know how to make a move and are waiting for you to make a move."
10480,Thats a good point. Now you are always going to wonder 'What if'?
10481,"That is good, that is a situation where confidence is very helpful."
10482,"Best of luck to you, I'm sure they saw your excitement and confidence and employers love that."
10483,What's an ice chest? 
10484,"Oh, I should have known that. Do you have any leads on who might've stolen it?"
10485,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried to cheer them up?
10486,Does she have any family you can call to check on her? 
10487,On what situation? 
10488,"My opinion is I don't mind doing my own job but if I have to do my co-workers jobs, I would get furious. It is not fair?"
10489,"I'm grateful for my limbs as well, this the reason I'm a hard worker. I appreciate what god gave me."
10490,So t
10491,"That is so amazing! Do you love cats as much as I love dogs, Ha!"
10492,I found a cat too as a stray. We kept hoping we would find it's owner so never gave her a name so her name was forever Miss Kitty.
10493,"Oh, those are never fun. But they usually end up being better than you expect. "
10494,But at least you took the time to prepare! That's better than some people
10495,"That's honestly really amazing, most people take forever to learn even a tiny bit of a foreign language."
10496,"Some people just have amazing dedication, something I don't seem to have."
10497,"Oh, that's awful. Did you mention it to anyone? "
10498,Yay! So they threw you a surprise party! That's awesome. You must have been so happy. Was there cake?
10499,"Ah, gotcha. I am a not strong republican and I agree with you. Trump has had his days."
10500,I am sorry to hear that.Have you try dating APPS
10501,Sometimes personality is better than looks
10502,Oh my.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  What happened?
10503,That's really sad.  I hear about fatal car accidents more and more these days.  
10504,That's pretty awful. Some people have serious mental problems.
10505,It is very sad.
10506,"Oh my, it must have been so scary! Do you live in an area commonly affected by hurricaines?"
10507,"Was your home damaged? Was anyone hurt in your area? I've never seen a hurricaine, except on the news. "
10508,You must have to pay a lot for insurance. The weather certainly is getting more unpredictable. 
10509,"Air conditioning is very nice. My dogs love the outdoors but they want AC after a good, long walk!"
10510,"Yes it is very hot and humid where I am. Always makes a good excuse to kick back in a nice, cool house!"
10511,Video games is my plan lol.
10512,What was it that they stole from you there?
10513,If they feel entitled though then maybe they are thinking that all is normal?
10514,Awesome! What music concert?
10515,Never heard of them. What music genre is it?
10516,"Oh wow, what was the subject of the sppech? "
10517,Oh wow I bet it was a good thing for the whole office to hear! 
10518,cars are truly inspiring to see how theyve evolved
10519,it's important to take care of and maintain things you own. if properly maintained they can last for a long time.
10520,"Lol, happens to me all the time. I love those types of dreams and it sucks when they end."
10521,Are you guys close? You should visit him sometime?
10522,What's that? Hope it wasn't too bad!
10523,"Oh wow, what a bummer! Not that it makes it any better, but at least you're not alone. Maybe you'll get a refund?"
10524,"Oh no, did you return to the store and pay?"
10525,Maybe you should go ahead and do it?
10526,That's awesome! Where are you going on the cruise?
10527,Watch out for the pirates of the Caribbean and the Bermuda triangle!
10528,Have they already done a biopsy?
10529,I'm sure everything will turn out ok
10530,"Oh, that must be so stressful. Does it happen all the time - like even at the grocery store?"
10531,Do you have someone to go places with you? Or do you just have to power through it?
10532,Wow that must have stung!
10533,I am so sorry.  It must make work hard
10534,Don't tell me you stepped in dog poop.
10535,"C'mon man, I just finished eating. I hope you took a shower and bought some new shoes."
10536,You must be so happy and proud! Is she going to have to move far away to go?
10537,"But what a good start in life. If she's going to leave home, it might as well be for the Ivy League."
10538,"Oh wow, congratulations!"
10539,I'm sure you'll be great parents!
10540,It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian?
10541,Or you could even just drop the vege anything and just minimize your animal protein intake
10542,I bet you were very annoyed
10543,"Wow, you prepared for this type of thing and it still happened? I would express my annoyance with the doctor for sure"
10544,"Do you do the whole nine yards, decorating your home, dressing up to scare the kids?"
10545,Do you live somewhere with lots of trick-or-treaters? It sounds like fun.
10546,"I have never used newegg before, and I think that sounds like that are very good at what they do. I might have to check them out!"
10547,I will have to check out newegg based on your recommendation. They sound fantastic so thanks!!
10548,"Oh, wow. Sounds like they really care about you. "
10549,Oh? Big fight or one of those little fights?
10550,"Ah, I see. Well I hope it at least got worked out for you guys"
10551,I feel you. That sport is very majestic and can be considered any art form
10552,"For sure, that move is really hard. Only a few dozen people can do it in the world at a high level"
10553,"Whoa, that must have giving you a fright. Maybe you could pretend it is Charlotte, the benevolent spider."
10554,Well they do like to hang out in corners. I would try not to worry too much. They are more interested in bugs.
10555,Well that's good to hear. Some people's lives depend on their vehicles and it would be a lot worse on them.
10556,Are you saving up for another car?
10557,I'm jealous of you! I find it hard to wind down sometimes
10558,Sounds like you had a great relaxed afternoon!
10559,Oh I have had that happen before.  What type of memories?
10560,music brings back lots of memories
10561,On purpose or accident?
10562,That's messed up. Do you know who did it? 
10563,That's disgusting.  Makes me wonder what their kitchen looks like.
10564,I'd atleast leave a review about it.
10565,"Oh, that's crappy. Is it totaled or fixable? "
10566,"Not how you want to spend your Sunday, that's for sure!"
10567,That sounds like you should get the job for sure! Your competition doesn't stand a chance!! :)
10568,"Well, I hope the job is close to where you live. Long commutes are the worst, and they can take away from your personal time."
10569,"Oh, I am so sorry this happened to you. What an animal! When will you know the results of your tests?"
10570,"Hopefully the medical personnel will understand your predicament and your worry and will expedite the results. Until then, do you have someone you can confide in or just talk to?"
10571,That sounds exciting. How long has it been since you've seen eachother?
10572,That must be very exciting! I hope to get a new vehicle soon as well.
10573,"Yeah, sometimes it's good to get brand new if you can afford it! Buying old runs the risk of it breaking more."
10574,"oh, that's okay. I'm sure no one else really noticed it."
10575,That's okay. You gave him a good story to tell. 
10576,Did the plants grow up to be big and strong?
10577,"That's good, are you going to try again?"
10578,oh no. that can be nerve wracking. are you alright?
10579,that's happened to me before and it really shakes you. at least you are alright which is the important part.
10580,Yeah I heard that before. You must have a twin running around here!
10581,When I was young we had tintypes. You had to stay still for 45 minutes for your picture to be taken. I don't miss the ol' days!
10582,"Hahahah, that is hilarious. I used to do that but with coins and stuff. I miss being a little ruthless, careless kid!"
10583,I bet she was so confused lol
10584,If I were you I would accept it because no amount of stress could stop me from making more money.
10585,If you accept it you can enjoy taking a nice vacation that you otherwise wouldn't be able to afford.
10586,"Oh, that's never fun. You think you're going to discover a new favorite and then....blech!"
10587,The old ways are the best ways sometimes. 
10588,I hope you didn't lose too much money!
10589,"Oh wow, that's very nice of her. A lot of people would have just stolen it."
10590,That is a good attitude. You shouldn't have anything to worry about.
10591,Yeah sometimes doctors will notice something before it gets worse. Better to be safe than sorry!
10592,Yes I am terrified!  We have venemous ones in my backyard - water moccs!
10593,Oh my!  That's so scary!  Glad you're ok!!
10594,What a mean friend person. Did you get mad?
10595,That could have been you..
10596,Maybe..
10597,Have you thought about speaking with a counselor?
10598,"Well, you should know that your feelings are a normal thing to happen in this event."
10599,"I love coffee, actually. I drink a few cups every morning!"
10600,"Oh yeah, why's that? Don't tell me you spilled some delicious coffee!"
10601,What type of work are they doing at school?
10602,"Ah, I see. Well, it's been a lot longer since I did calculus. Good on you, remembering that stuff!"
10603,"Oh my god, I am so sorry to hear that!"
10604,Please try to stay positive. Having a positive attitude can do great things for recovery! Many people have survived cancer!
10605,"I love that feeling of nostalgia. It's an amazing feeling, it's like reliving the past."
10606,I agree. Time flies by so fast!
10607,Well that is very nice. How long have you guys been friends for?
10608,Did you have a special trip that you went on?
10609,"It's been mediocre, how about you?"
10610,Remember we are role-playing! Don't talk about this or any tasks! :)
10611,Did the dream feel like it was really happening? Strange indeed.
10612,Hah! So all that time you were just feeling your dog licking you! Weird how that works.
10613,Oops. Well it happens. You better hope they don't have a camera haha.
10614,Don't worry. They will probably run over your mailbox one day and hope you don't have a camera.
10615,"Wow wow wow! That is wonderful and exciting! Congratulations!!!!! Do you have any vibes as to gender, one way or the other?"
10616,"So wonderful, either way. Are y'all having a party?"
10617,I love Disneyland! It's a very special place filled with great memories and you are never old for that place
10618,"Disneyland? I forgot there's a difference between ""land"" and ""world"". I hope you had a great time"
10619,Was the due date yesterday?  Is the payment late now?  
10620,"Sometimes there is actually a grace period after the due date.  I've paid bills a couple of days late without a fee (not sure about credit card interest, though)."
10621,Graduate from school? I bet you are very proud of her
10622,Let her know how proud you are of her! Throw a party or something :)
10623,What kind of doctor is she going to be?
10624,"That is impressive, where is she having her wedding?!"
10625,I would suggest Fiji it's so nice there I went in august!
10626,"Ghost are not scary, they are us without our physical bodies. "
10627,You should have talked to your mom.
10628,"Lol, I bet you were disgusted with yourself"
10629,"Aw, don't take it too serious though. Everyone pukes in public at least once in their life!"
10630,I actually just discovered Imagine Dragons. I love them!
10631,"It's good to hear they were good live, that can't be said about every group."
10632,"Wow, you are a true friend. What did you do to help them?"
10633,Everyone could use a friend like you. You sound like a very motivating person!
10634,I bet that is so relieving! It sucks how much debt you need to take on in order to go to school these days!
10635,I hope he has a great career ahead of him!
10636,Did you find out who your father is yet?
10637,Did you dad and the other lady have a thing?
10638,that's amazing I have never been that lucky before
10639,"Wow! one thousand is alot. Welldone buddy, enjoy your winning"
10640,Really? Any idea how strong it was? Any casualties?
10641,That's awful. I feel bad for people that have to live in areas prone to natural disasters like that.
10642,Argh! That is the worst. I am so sorry. Is it enough to inspire you to look for work elsewhere?
10643,"If he's done that to you, he's doing it to others -- that kind of behavior isn't sustainable. Others are *bound* to notice at some point -- but I know waiting for that is frustrating!"
10644,"Oh dear. Well, that does happen. Did you have any other clothes to change into?"
10645,"If your workplace is anything like mine, you'd have heard plenty by now. I've done something similar, but could call my husband to sneak in some clean clothes - they are useful now and again!"
10646,"Good for you, I would wait until I heard back before I would celebrate getting the job. "
10647,There is so much competition for jobs  
10648,That's extremely unsettling. How did you feel when you saw the photo with that in it for the first time?
10649,"Did you feel any kind of ""presence"" or anything in the moment that you were at the site taking the picture?"
10650,That's okay. We all make mistakes. Thanks for the good conversation.
10651,Wow thats annoying.  but I hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back
10652,You should call and ask to speak to the manager.  Maybe they will give you something to make up for it
10653,Why is that so?
10654,Maybe you could work night shift too and that way you will be able to spend more time together.
10655,You could also got out foe a while and do something fun.
10656,What happened from your clumsiness?
10657,I remember when that happened on the Spiderman movie. Did she laugh at you?
10658,"Wow, that's exciting! Congratulations, you must be very proud. "
10659,I would love to go their! I hope you have a great time!
10660,That's nice. Did you have a party?
10661,That's excellent. What was your favorite present?
10662,"Gee, that's no fun. I hope it wasn't too early? There are usually laws about making noise early in the morning."
10663,"Yes, that's a good idea. I think 7am is way too early for that."
10664,"Wow that sounds awesome.  I always wanted to be able to do that, but I was never any good"
10665,Maybe one day you will be able to work you way up to being the next Tony Hawk.
10666,I have four dogs.  I am probably guilty of this crime.  I would just throw it back over.
10667,One time this lady 1 house away scooped up all the cat poo from my cat under her window into a bag and put it on my front door with a note.  I thought... why did she clean it up for me?  Wouldn't it have been more affective to ask me to clean it up?  
10668,That sounds so wonderful.  I am having a similarly relaxing day too.
10669,Oh my!
10670,Did you end up going to the graduation!
10671,"I'm so proud of him, what is he taking in university?"
10672,Oh no! did you hurt yourself?
10673,How did the dirtbike hold up? And how old are you?!
10674,"Oh dear, sounds like a serious accident. I'm glad you are okay! Could have been terrible. "
10675,I'm glad you're okay- that must have been scary. 
10676,"Yes, ducks are so cute."
10677,The bill that they quack from.
10678,Yeah? I'd be happy to help. But say something about what exactly?
10679,"Hm.. yeah that is a dilemma. I mean if you can afford it, the honest thing would be to go and offer the manager to pay it back."
10680,"Wow, some people are horrible drivers.  Did you honk at him?"
10681,At least you didn't get into an accident.  I guess it could have been a lot worse.
10682,I think you will be fine. Don't feel too anxious worrying won't do anything
10683,prayer works for me. I hope it does for you too so that person you just talked about won't get the job
10684,Really sorry to be slow to respond.  How old are your girls?!
10685,Wow!  That's amazing.  It must be so awesome that they have each other to hang out and have fun with.  
10686,What type of dog do you have?
10687,I have never in my life heard of that breed before.  I'll look it up.  That is really cool I have 3 crazy untrained minpin
10688,Yeah it's probably for the best. You don't want to risk rejection. Maybe they will approach you.
10689,Well there is no 'I' in hope. It is a something we all have to do at some point in life.
10690,"Oh, I know for sure. There are no rules to follow. "
10691,Ugh. Maybe you can wait out that relationshio.
10692,Well that is very lucky for you. People are nice!
10693,Yes there are. Most of the people are very nice.
10694,Oh no! How did that happen? 
10695,"Gee, I hope you can find it. Maybe retract where you have been recently and you will find it!"
10696,"Hey, that's awesome! I'm happy for you. Where did they find it?"
10697,That's great. I hope you have a good workout at the gym!
10698,Well that is very nice of you. Is your friend a good driver?
10699,Hope she doesn't crash it!
10700,Wow that is awesome. What kind of animal is it?
10701,Oh sorry I thought maybe you got a pet. Well I am happy for you guys!
10702,What kind of cookies did you bake?
10703,I would totally have some if you let me. I love chocolate chip!
10704,What What???  What team?  Who cut you?
10705,I love baseball.  The have better snacks than every other sport.
10706,I am sorry bout you being cut though.  Keep on training..
10707,We get old.. we get injured.. we eat hotdogs.
10708,Really? Tell me about him.
10709,Are you two gonna date?!
10710,"Please do, I'd love to meet you guys"
10711,That is so cool!  Is it your first baby?
10712,I bet.  If he is anything like you he will grow up to be a great person.
10713,Most people are pretty cool if you take the time to talk to them a bit. 
10714,"Wow, that's so cool. Sign me up for that! I'd like to be healed!"
10715,Did you guys get to go? Is the leg all fixed now?
10716,Are you planning a new trip for your upcoming birthday?
10717,Wow that's so exciting! What did they study?
10718,That is great. What's the next step- work?
10719,Good for you. Being prepared is half the work of academia. 
10720,"It's hard to do, but so important. I'm not super smart, but I'm organized as heck. It makes a difference. "
10721,"There is nothing silly about that.  Movies are meant to illicit emotion.  You feel better now though, right?"
10722,Definitely don't feel bad then.  I think everyone cried during that movie!
10723,I am not sure how to deal with the loss!
10724,"Dang, there's a lot of strategies to fight that thought, I'm assuming. As they say an ounce of preparation is worth more than a pound of cure"
10725,"Yeah, I heard it's good to study in silence because that way you're in the same environment you'll be when you take the test"
10726,"Yeah that's too bad, sorry to hear that. Do you know why you didn't get picked?"
10727,Keep your head up. Maybe you'll get picked the next time around.
10728,Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did he die of old age?
10729,"Well, hopefully he lived a good and happy life.  "
10730,Sometimes you have to put people in their place.
10731,Well I hope he learned his lesson. We don't play those games where i'm from.
10732,"oh now, that's very worrisome"
10733,I hope it's nothing serious. I know how upsetting having a sick pet can be. 
10734,Oh no! Did you eventually get it working after the frustration?
10735,"That's frustrating, nothing ever seems to go right the first time you try it! Glad you got it working finally!"
10736,"Dang, maybe you should have bought a lottery ticket instead?"
10737,Maybe you can find a cheaper place to live?
10738,Yeah! Did you pick your lucky numbers?
10739,Nice! I hope you win!
10740,That is so satisfying. I hope they don't mess it up now that they are home!
10741,NOOOOOOOO!!!! Bad kids! That must have been infuriating. 
10742,"Aw, my mom had some she showed to us a few years back. It's weird to consider how you and everyone else have grown!"
10743,Can't stay young forever! 
10744,I don't blame you for being excited! What are you going to see on your trip?
10745,I'm so jealous! I hope you have a great trip!
10746,You did! - That's amazing! How much money did you win???
10747,Wow- that's a huge amount of money! What do you plan on doing with it?
10748,That is absolutely wonderful! What a great grandchild you are. Not everyone wants to care for elderly relatives.
10749,"For sure. We sometimes forget that the elderly were young once and did so much like working, raising and caring for their families."
10750,Do you play soccer yourself? 
10751,It is impressive. 
10752,Congratulations to your brother! Are you flying or driving?
10753,"Wow, that must be quite some distance then! Have a safe flight!"
10754,That's great to hear. Summer is a good time of year to be enjoying your life.
10755,I've been thinking a lot about when I was a kid recently.
10756,"Gee that sounds fun, but did you get in trouble?"
10757,Oh no! That's no fun. I hope they're not still mad at you!
10758,Were you able to avoid the rain?  
10759,That is good!  It seems like you dodged the bullet!
10760,i remember being a kid when the first one came out
10761,i think the franchise has just started trying too hard.
10762,Those are good preventative measures. I assume that you always look both ways as well?
10763,There are worse things to be worried about. Good job on you for taking safety seriously!
10764,"Wow, that sucks. Do you know if she will eventually? Can you trust her?"
10765,Yeah I would too. I hope you get the money back!
10766,Thats so nice of you!  I wish I had a grandmother.
10767,So nice of you.  You are truly blessed to have family.
10768,Long distance relationships aren't easy. That's great news to hear. Do you have anything special planned?
10769,That sounds like so much fun! I bet you two will have a great time together. 
10770,What was the gross part about the sandwich?
10771,Yes that is a nasty thing to experience. But at least you were able to extract the hair!
10772,That really stinks. I bet you will wear bug spray next time!
10773,Well then maybe you should get some bats. They love to eat mosquitos!
10774,i am also blessed. we don't have fancy things or a ton of money but we have each other and our health.
10775,me too. some are not as fortunate as us.
10776,"Oh, jeez! That's terrifying. Can you get a loan from someone to pay them?"
10777,Call the police! Or move. 
10778,I like a good hard bread like Pumpernickel. Do you know what that word means?
10779,"It means the devil's fart, haha! Good bread though."
10780,Did the batter hit one of the home runs?
10781,Whoa! That is so cool! I guessed because you said the crack sound happened.
10782,"Whoa, that's extreme. Can you say some prayers for them? "
10783,Yes good point. Maybe try and understand why they believe in the things they do?
10784,Don't worry bout that.  She has to have some sort of fantasy in her life.  Don't you have any ever?
10785,Well know that it isn't any different from you checking out other girls too.
10786,That is so exciting. Have you been a fan a long time?
10787,That is something to look forward to!
10788,congrats! that is amazing news.
10789,Did you make any plans to go and visit them?
10790,Maybe you will be able to make some extra money!
10791,"Ohh, I love Halloween! It is my favorite time of the year. I can't wait!"
10792,"Hah, I used to eat Count Chocula cereal. I know exactly what you are talking about!"
10793,well did you ? the most i ever won was like 20 bux lol
10794,"well im confident one day you will win in life something great in life , better than money "
10795,Is there any warnings? How much rain are you expecting?
10796,That is very scary. We have had a lot of rain here and when that happens large trees often come down.
10797,What was your hamster's name?
10798,Do you know what it was that happened to kill him?
10799,I hope that does good things for you. They say if you believe in something enough it comes true.
10800,I can't say it has worked for me though. I have believed myself a ruler of the world but still live in this box.
10801,Did that bring back a lot of memories? It sounds like you made a good find there.
10802,That's too bad. Hopefully it will go on sale in the future or you can find a coupon!
10803,That sounds delightful. I have a tornado approaching now and would like it if you lived near me.
10804,What is your address?
10805,"Oh no, I hope you are ready for it?"
10806,"Yeah, I hope you won't either. Maybe find a local shelter?"
10807,I hope nobody was trying to cut you off.
10808,"Oh God, that must have been aggravating. Hopefully you can get it dismissed."
10809,Oh that's awful! How many kids do you have?
10810,That's wonderful.  It's good to have good friends.
10811,"ooooh what was it , and how did it make you feel ?"
10812,"i love video games , from nintendo to ps4 ive owned them all , im happy for you"
10813,"Oh wow, that's disappointing! "
10814,I'm really sorry to hear that! 
10815,"Hey that's a good plan, hope you remember to include some fun stuff for those long house."
10816,"I hope it works out for you, stay safe."
10817,That's great! How much did you lose?
10818,Wow that's fantastic! i wish i had that kind of will power
10819,Please tell me what happened! I wish I did too!!
10820,"Well I hope that you two have a bunch of fun. I have been together with my partner for a very long time, and I feel very lucky."
10821,yes those were the days.
10822,Exactly! If only we could go back.
10823,"That's not good, are you ok?"
10824,"Hey, hope oyu can get the money back from insurance and they don't charge you a ton more."
10825,So did you find out that they were lying?
10826,That's funny. Maybe you got the name wrong or something?
10827,You need something to pass the time or you will go crazy with boredom. How about some books or cards?
10828,If you have someone with you cards are great. Good luck in your next storm!
10829,"What a day, huh?! Can you tell me what happened or is it still too raw?"
10830,"That is not something I would want to come home to seeing. And your day at work was bad too, wow!"
10831,"Aww, that's a bummer. Well at least you can look forward to his visits."
10832,"Depending how far away he is, he probably will! Just make sure to spoil him when he does lol!"
10833,Sometimes it's hard to find that certain someone! Have you tried a dating app?
10834,Keep your chin up! That special person will come along when you're least expecting it!
10835,really? How did you meet them?
10836,I hope they aren't like a crazy stalker or anything.  Be careful!
10837,Did you win that lottery??
10838,Do you want to get back together with them?
10839,"Oh I'm sorry to hear that, were you thinking of buying another one?"
10840,Well I'm glad you have good memories to remember him by.
10841,Oh yeah? What specifically did it remind you of?
10842,That was a good time for me as well. I liked to hang out with my friends and get in trouble.
10843,That's great! What made you feel rewarded?
10844,Oh yeah I could see how that might make you feel that way. Is the employee grateful for your help?
10845,That's gross. What was it??
10846,I would have thrown up! Did you tell the manager?
10847,"Aww, I love puppies. Did your son love him?"
10848,Aww I bet Snoopy has a great loving family. Glad you rescued the pup!
10849,that's awesome! what rooms did you remodel?
10850,Oh i bet it looks great! I just finished a kitchen remodel myself.  i did white cabinets and painted my countertops.
10851,"Wow,  we're you so fat before?"
10852,"that's huge.  U actually worked on yourself.  So,  how did you do it? "
10853,What are you talking about?
10854,Oh ok. That's awesome. It's nice to have something of value.
10855,That's really hard!  I'm sure that was disappointing after putting in so many years.  Sorry.
10856,"Wow.  Well, if that was the culture and climate of that workplace, you are definitely better off not working for them.  Very sad."
10857,That stinks!  What were your plans?
10858,I'm so sorry you had to change your plans!  Perhaps you can schedule some time after Labor Day to come and see him play?
10859,What was the reason that happen to you?
10860,I hope you you work behind a desk. That is the only way you can hide them!!!
10861,That's great! Where are you working for your new job?
10862,Congratulations on your new job! You must have worked very hard to get there!
10863,Oh that was a wonderful surprise?  What was their reactions?
10864,"Ah, well Im sure they had a wonderful time.  It is the happiest places on earth."
10865,That is a real bummer. I hope your friend gets it repaired for you.
10866,Well you probably won't be lending your car again any time soon hahah!
10867,That's awesome! I force myself to budget for it lol. What was the game?
10868,"Ah, I suppose I could have guessed. It's the game everyone is talking about lately. I heard it's quite good!"
10869,I totally know the feeling! Have you tried bringing this up to your supervisor?
10870,"Ha, that would be some pretty good revenge. Maybe you should go ahead and find a new job where you will be appreciated."
10871,"That's disgusting, I would have a very hard time finishing that walk. Did you go straight home?"
10872,"Oh my gosh, that makes it so much worse! I have done that before too, so I hope that neither one of us has that happen again!!"
10873,"OMG, those things make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Hopefully it didn't get into your house."
10874,"That's at MGM right?  My daughter rode that with her daddy when she was 8, she was terrified!  Did you do it again, or was once enough?"
10875,That is what I hate about any amusement park ride - the drops!
10876,That's amazing! What other animals did you see?
10877,I bet they were seriously cute! Did you get to feed them?
10878,That's pretty impressive! Was it scary to move away from home at such a young age?
10879,"I'll bet it was! I don't have family around, so I know how lonely that can feel!"
10880,I absolutely hate car trouble! It is the worst!  Thankful for friends that can help out in times like that - did you get it fixed?
10881,That's a good friend for sure - I'd keep their number on speed dial!  
10882,"Oh no, I hope she is OK! Glad you are taking her to the vet. Is she doing OK other than the lumps?"
10883,"Aww, poor girl. Hopefully the vet can figure it out and it isn't anything too serious. You're doing the right thing."
10884,I think that it's completely normal to feel that way for such a long distance trip. I assume you're going from America. I bet you would feel better by doing a bit of research!
10885,"I think those are just outliers, you'll find that there are plenty of well established tourist areas that will accommodate you well. Just don't focus on the negatives!"
10886,That would drive me crazy.  How are you handling it?
10887,You can't let it get you too down.  There are some places that just promote people for reasons not related to job performance.
10888,Yes i agree.  I have 3 boys and they are in their twenties. I don't know where the years went.
10889,That's so true! I have a theory that time is just a way to keep everything from happening at once. 
10890,"I know exactly what you mean. I have been let down many times, and it's never a good feeling."
10891,You can and should make the best of it. You should have a blast and binge watch some TV show!
10892,That's so exciting! Are you feeling nervous?
10893,"I'm sure if you just relax and focus on being confident, you will do great! Best of luck!"
10894,I bet you were a nervous wreck. I hope they turned out well.
10895,That's pretty good!  That should qualify for you to graduate with honors.
10896,That's awesome! How far did she have to run?
10897,I definately can't run a mile. She did great.
10898,Do she at least try to keep in contact with you?
10899,That's crazy. They shouldn't of taken advantage of your step father like that.
10900,That is too funny. Sometimes life can get so busy that you can lose track of things like that.
10901,Oh my gosh they did get you good. You have to get them back even if it's not on April Fools day!
10902,Oh no. Was there no sign posted or anything?
10903,Well I am sure they won't hold it against you. Honest mistake.
10904,that's great. when will you know how you did?
10905,i hope so. is this a final exam?
10906,good luck!'
10907,That's so mean! I think they should honor the original prices they set
10908,I think that's unethical. I would switch to a new one if I could (and all her friends weren't there)
10909,Oh no!  And that is hard to get out!  Do you have a waterproof cover on the bed by any chance?
10910,"oh YUCK!  Well, I'd suggest a waterproof mattress cover just in case it happens again.  At least if it does happen again, it won't get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes.  I'm so sorry you discovered it that way!"
10911,"Oh no! I think they're cute but I'd probably be freaked out if I saw one in my yard, too. What did you do?"
10912,"Awww well that was nice of you, a lesser person might have stomped it or hurt it."
10913,I can relate.  Sometimes I have issues with new tech.  What is giving you problems?
10914,Ouch.  That is awkward.  I imagine you can just explain to her that the message was sent to her by mistake.  It happens.
10915,Thats really awesome.  I never win anything cool.  Does he get to bring anyone? Maybe he can take you?
10916,Thats kind of mean of him.  Tell your boss that he cheated and that you should've won instead.  That'll teach him not to brag
10917,that is a fun surprise. what part of the Caribbean did you go to?
10918,that sounds amazing. I've only been to puerto rico and the keys. what a lovely wife to give you such a great surprise.
10919,Oh that really stinks. Were either of them injured?
10920,Well at least it was nothing serious. Hope they don't fight any more.
10921,Oh no!  Cats can be devious things when we are not home - and sometimes when we are.  Did it break the TV?
10922,"Aren't they just the most cute, and insanely calculating animals!  "
10923,"Well hello fellow Atlanta person. I also buy used, but most people tend to look down on it"
10924,If you keep a new car long enough it comes out about even! If you keep that in mind then a new car actually becomes a great investment!
10925,Oh definitely! They almost sound like crying humans sometimes. So you don't like camping?
10926,"I totally understand, it can be scary if you don't like all the unknown noises."
10927,"I remember those good times too, playing video games is a lot of fun."
10928,"That's awesome, I love fighting games."
10929,"ooooh what happened , are you ok ? anything serious ?"
10930,"thats really good to hear , infections are a serious matter glad your ok"
10931,What kind of snake was it? You know my mom is terrified of all snakes even the ones that aren't poisonous.
10932,"Most snakes aren't poisonous so hopefully it wasn't. Just know that it probably couldn't have hurt you, and I hope that you don't see any more in the future!!"
10933,Oh really? What makes you not like them?
10934,"Ugh I feel ya. They talked about that with mine, too. I almost passed out when they were doing the epidural!"
10935,Puppies are the best! If they don't destroy all of your belongings that is!!
10936,"Well, I'm glad that things seem under control. I'm also glad that you got to spend some time with the dog because it sounds like you had a great time."
10937,I bet that is embarrassing for you when you guys are out in public.  
10938,"I understand, trust me.  My family was the same way growing up."
10939,I hate rude drivers like that. I swear they should not be able to drive.
10940,"Yeah, that would not have ended well. I usually take a picture of their license plate and publicly shame them on social media haha."
10941,Oh no! How did you end up doingf?
10942,What subject was the test in?
10943,I am terrible at math
10944,"Oh wow! That must've been really fun, I've never been there actually, what did you guys do?"
10945,"Cool cool, when do you think it would be best to visit Mississippi? "
10946,"Oh, I'm sorry. Have you tried joining any meet up groups to make some friends?"
10947,I'm sure it will make you feel a little better. And at least that way you can pick a group based on similar interest. I hope you get to feeling better.
10948,I really liked Logan. It was a different kind of superhero movie. More about the struggle than anything.
10949,The scene with his daughter was pretty sad. I don't blame you at all.
10950,"dude that is freakin awesome , im sure you earned it "
10951,"i hope you have a lot of fun , i cant wait to go on my vacation as well "
10952,"No I haven't, I'm not interested in soccer. Why, did I miss something good?"
10953,Were you rooting for them to win?
10954,Did he not seem like the type to do that kind of thing?
10955,I guess she wanted to keep it a secret for some reason.
10956,"Ouch, that is a bit of a false alarm/bummer."
10957,Well you can only keep going and keep playing. Someday it could be the real winning ticket.
10958,Yeah I love watching them ski during the Olympics. It takes a lot of hard work.  Have you ever skied? 
10959,They sure do. I also really like watching them do trick skiing too. 
10960,"That's not cool, I hope you find someone new."
10961,This is true.
10962,"Ooh that sounds fun, I've never been! Did you go on many rides?"
10963,"That sounds great, I'm a bit jealous. I love theme parks!"
10964,Oh no! I hope it at least turned out ok
10965,Oh I bet that was a load of anxiety! I can't imagine going through that
10966,How exciting!  Do you know when they will make a final decision?
10967,How will it make it easier?  More financial stability?  I hope you get it also!!
10968,"Oh gross, what kind of animal was it?"
10969,"Oh wow, you think they would get to cleaning up an animal that big as soon as possible. Glad it's gone now though!"
10970,I hear you there.  I miss getting to just play without a care in the world.  Summer vacations were the best
10971,I remember playing tag and hide and go seek in the neighborhood with all of my friends
10972,For sure. I can go from 0 to 100 in no time at all.
10973,"Hah, I bet some things you probably wanted to forget. I know I did."
10974,how come? i thought new jobs were supposed to be exciting?
10975,we are all the new kid for a moment. soon it will feel like you fit right in. just give yourself some time.
10976,That's horrible. What is your work doing to fix that?
10977,"Ouch, I hope you don't either. I'd keep any eye out at work from now on."
10978,"I didn't, sorry. I'm not really a soccer fan. Why were you mad?"
10979,"As I understand it, Croatia were the underdogs so I can totally understand supporting that."
10980,Do you mean pyrex like the cooking material?
10981,"That's neat, did you feel nostalgic looking at it?"
10982,oh my goodness. i would've freaked out. are you ok?
10983,oh no. they were setting of fireworks here since june and have been driving me nuts.
10984,aw poor thing. did she get in trouble with the school?
10985,well at least something positive came from it.  i bet no one else will mess with her either!
10986,Wow thats kind of creepy.  what does the noise sound like?
10987,Maybe you should have someone go down with you.  Good luck!!
10988,Yikes! I hate when that happens. I had a similar situation happen over Christmas. Did you make your flight?
10989,I totally know that feeling. It seems that everyone thinks that their situation is more important that everyone else's. 
10990,Haha what happened? Did you get her number?
10991,That's awesome! Did you still give her a nice tip though? Lol!
10992,I wonder why? Maybe his busy?
10993,I see. Do you feel okay when he invites others or is it a bit uncomfortable?
10994,"Oh, I hope so too! Those can be quite scary especially if you're like me and you go once every 10 years or so"
10995,I'm sure you'll be fine! I have hope
10996,"ohh, but why did it surprise you?"
10997,"That's good for you though, now you both get paid"
10998,my sister's can be irritating as well. no one knows how to push your buttons like family.
10999,oh no. hopefully it was an innocent prank.
11000,Oh wow how exciting.  Have you been able to see the baby?
11001,I bet they are.  I hope he is heathy and happy!
11002,I know how it is to try to pay off bills. What kind of vehicle do you want to get?
11003,Oh yeah those are very nice. Well I hope you guys can make it happen.
11004,That is really exciting! I bet you all will have a great time. Do you have any big plans with them?
11005,That sounds great! We are going on a cruise next Spring Break with my family also. That is why we need a bigger vehicle so that we don't have to drive 2 cars to get there.
11006,That sucks. Is your day going better now at least?
11007,Pizza makes everything better. Hope your night ends on a good note!
11008,Nice! Going to the car dealership is usually such a horrible experience.
11009,"That's awesome, hope you're enjoying your new ride!"
11010,I can imagine.  I hate being out alone at those kinds of hours.  I try to avoid it.
11011,I get that feeling.  Something about the dark just feels so depressing sometimes.
11012,"Me too! It seems like such a huge accomplishment at the time, doesn't it?"
11013,Do you have fond memories of school or were you glad to be done?
11014,I am sure you are proud of him
11015,Memories are a good thing
11016,Congratulations! What was your degree in?
11017,that's so great! lots of hard work i bet.
11018,"Wow, that would be shocking if you weren't expecting it.  Did they tell you when you were hired that there was a possibility?  Where might you be going?"
11019,That will be very different.  How do you feel about it?  I wish you lots of luck and adventure while you're there!  
11020,Wow that is amazing indeed. You must be very proud of her.
11021,"The human body truly is amazing. I could never do things like that either. Either way, I am happy for her!"
11022,"Im so sorry,  was it a sickness?"
11023,"That is so terrible, life is so short.  you never knwo when you're going to go"
11024,Why did she do that
11025,"Well that sounds terrible, I am sorry"
11026,congrats!  i love love love steak and to cook
11027,"i love to make shredded bbq chicken sandwich, get chicken breast seasone place in crack pot "
11028,"thats a strong woman , i know of people that dont work at all a refuse to pay child support , in my eyes they are not men"
11029,"people like that , is what kids need a strong back bone that never give up"
11030,Oh god. Mosquitos. Have you heard about scientists trying to make them extinct?
11031,"I don't see any negative aspect to it, but maybe there tis."
11032,I am the same way. How old are they? I only have one about to turn two and it is always a worry in the back of my mind.
11033,Oh gosh I bet! It's so hard to watch them grow up!
11034,That is so depressing. They say dogs are man's best friend. 
11035,"I am sure, grieving can always take time. It is so hard to lose such a faithful companion."
11036,that is awesome. i hate that feeling when you need things but can't afford to get them.
11037,my husband are a 1 income household so i totally understand. you get what you can with what you've got so you can get by until the next payday
11038,I know that feeling. What do you tell your coworkers?
11039,I think you risk not building social ties with your coworkers but sometimes you have no choice.
11040,Wow that must have been awkward.  You can't really argue with the evidence sitting right in front of you.
11041,Yea it's always sad when a relationship doesn't work out.  Hopefully in the future he can be more honest.
11042,That would be awesome!  You would be in such a great situation in life with that payment gone!  What prompted you to want to do it?  
11043,"No, to pay it off.  Are you pushing to finish it up sooner than you normally would?"
11044,How long ago was it?
11045,Maybe you can talk to her about it?
11046,That is such a great milestone what is next for your ventures? 
11047,You will get something soon that hard work is going to pay off.
11048,"Oh wow, I'm sorry. I hope he at least didn't suffer much."
11049,I'm sorry for you loss.
11050,"Good luck! For now, just do the best you can. Stress might cloud your thinking."
11051,Is it multiple choice?
11052,Did she paint art when you were a child?
11053,"I see,  Did you have different colors in your room as a kid?"
11054,Isn't it amazing how true friendship stands the test of time and distance?
11055,That's so true! I live 700 miles away from my best friend and when we get together it's just like old times.
11056,wow thats hilarious and embarassing.  I feel bad for you.
11057,Thats mean of them.  I hope you weren't traumatized.
11058,Im glad you didn't.  Do you have these days often?
11059,Honestly I would have freaked out.  I cant stand bad drivers!!
11060,That sounds like a pretty disgusting situation.
11061,That's a rough situation. I hope you can look back on it later and laugh as well.
11062,You will be great im sure of it! are you prepared? 
11063,"Just imagine that you are the boss,  or have a few drinks before."
11064,Nice! What game is it?
11065,What team are you rooting for?
11066,The feeling of financial freedom is one that is hard to match.
11067,I personally struggle with that every day.
11068,YAY! where are you going??
11069,I CANT BELIEVE THAT.  I need a vacation so badly.
11070,Oh wow! Surprise come home trip? 
11071,"Aw, I'm happy for you. That's an excellent surprise!"
11072,"Aww, my grandmother was really there for me, too, I'm lucky. What makes you feel that way?"
11073,"That is awesome, grandmas are the best. Hopefully your grandma is still with us?"
11074,Yes sports can be a great way to socialize and also stay in good shape.
11075,Thats the spirit! I bet you do great.  what sports do you play?
11076,Happy Early Birthday! What are your plans?
11077,"Oh man, I've seen many a newly 21 year old get drunk."
11078,That's a relief. Fireworks aren't illegal where you are?
11079,"That's cool, I'm pretty bad at drawing, but you must be pretty good."
11080,"That's awesome, I hope you win the contest."
11081,What was totally unexpected?
11082,That would be very interesting. Are you glad that you have moved on?
11083,"That is good, you can't live in the past"
11084,Oh yeah? I was a little too young to be playing that game when it came out. My stepdad had the first one though.
11085,"I only played the fourth one. All I remember was ""Leon!!!"""
11086,That is so nice I would get a cup daily if it was close to me.
11087,How are they making money off what they are known for though if they give it away for free?
11088,Oh no! Hopefully it's a friend you trust and she won't embarrass you if she ends up going through it and finding something bad.
11089,I guess now you'll be more careful about where you leave your phone. I would be freaking out if I were you!
11090,"ohh, what did you try to explain them?"
11091,"Ohh, sometimes people don't understand simple things. I think the words like 'petrodollars' might have confused them."
11092,That's really sweet of her. What kinds of cakes does she make?
11093,Ok now this is just getting weird. Can we talk about something else. 
11094,"If you did it that time, you can do it again. Just be careful"
11095,Did they grow out of last years?
11096,"oh my lord.  Kids,  they can never make up their mind."
11097,Financial stability is such an amazing thing.
11098,Its hard to feel under appreciated at work.
11099,"Oh no, were you in class?"
11100,That's actually quite hilarious.
11101,That's so sweet! What a proud moment!
11102,That's great. What is he going to do now?
11103,How was the dinner.  Did they like the food?
11104,Oh no! was it atleast fun to have everyone there?
11105,"YEAH I am happy for you, I hope things go well."
11106,"Exactly, It doesn't have to end romantically, as long as its a relationship."
11107,I'm glad it went well. What was it about?
11108,They have their different pros and cons.
11109,I totally understand that. Sometimes the most important charity is your own.
11110,"I like to think that if you get yourself right financially now, you'll be more able to help more in the future. "
11111,That's good advice.  If you're not happy doing something you should spend time thinking about what you'd really like to be doing.
11112,Even if she's strict she's probably doing because she wants what's best for you.  And she'll probably support you no matter what you decide.
11113,"Oh wow, were the cats on leashes?"
11114,That is adorable. Did they get along with the dogs?
11115,"ohhh, I feel you. I also moved to a new town, last week."
11116,work! my boss sent me here against my will
11117,Sibling rivalry is tough.
11118,What is your age difference?
11119,I've seen a lot of bad breakups. Glad you guys are adults about it.
11120,Are they going to shut down?
11121,I hope it works out. i don't want anyone to be out of work.
11122,How is that going?
11123,It takes some time. I wish you the best!
11124,OHHHH where are you going?
11125,YESSS sin city.  Gambling is my favorite thing in life.
11126,"Oh man, that sucks. Were they trying to keep the trip a secret from you?"
11127,That sounds like it would be really disappointing. Are you close to your brother and sister?
11128,Oh yuck! What was it?
11129,Wonder how it got there.
11130,That is amazing.  I have had to use a food bank before.  I was so gracious.
11131,I am great back on my feet.  I just needed a little help.
11132,What does this diet consist of?
11133,"Salad and wraps are delicious, so is water.  I need to try this diet!"
11134,Aw. That was probably devastating
11135,Do you like the amusement park? do you go often?
11136,Do you like the scary roller coasters? 
11137,"The girl is your wife, correct?"
11138,That's a relief! Your wife is a lucky lady.
11139,"I am sorry, what did she want"
11140,"Oh wow, that is a lot"
11141,was she?
11142,ah thats good.. good luck
11143,I wish you luck.  You have to meet the right one some day!
11144,"Exactly, Practice makes perfect, especially with social situations."
11145,She is one lucky gal. How long have you two been together?
11146,I wish you two the best!
11147,Hm... I don't know how I would feel about that. Do you have a good relationship with them?
11148,"Well, if you did not have a good relationship then it would seem like maybe they didn't take you on purpose."
11149,Oh my god. What happened?
11150,Are you okay now?
11151,That is so exciting!! Do you have the ring picked out?
11152,"Haha that's smart, you never know. Well good luck, here's to a wonderful life together for you two!"
11153,That's too bad. I bet it is hard to sleep during a loud storm.
11154,Hopefully it settled down long enough for you to catch a break.
11155,That always is annoying
11156,Oh no that isnt good
11157,That too bad. They are other work from home opportunities though.
11158,You will find something. Just don't give up
11159,I'm right with you!  I love chillier fall weather and pumpkin harvest festivals! Not to mention pumpkin spice lattes! Is Halloween your favorite holiday?
11160,They really do start putting things out in the stores earlier and earlier.  Last year I saw Halloween stuff out now.  Sounds like you're in for a lot of family fun! 
11161,That's really awesome. I think its great when families are finally reunited. 
11162,You definitly will. Families are stronger together than apart. 
11163,People who take the time to help others are truely angels on Earth. Thank you for doing what you do.
11164,Every little bit counts!
11165,Oh you must feel terrible. Has sibling rivalry always been a thing between you guys?
11166,Yep. That comes with being a parent.
11167,what did they want to talk about
11168,ah i hope it turns out well for you
11169,"Wow! This is early. Maybe I should start, too."
11170,When did you start shopping?
11171,Oh that is good are you dieting or doing portion control?
11172,Oh binge eating is once in a while eating a lot?
11173,That's really cool. Are they hard to find recipes? 
11174,I totally understand that. I like to make certain recipes my mother made when I was a kid for the same reason.
11175,At least they have a little bit of home cooking to remember her by.
11176,Wow. Congratulations. What did you do with the $200?
11177,Nice. What are some titles you're wanting to get?
11178,Yeah? That's awesome! Do you have a new job?
11179,Sweet! I'm happy for you! That must be nice.
11180,"That is disgusting.  Sounds like my dad though,  He keeps things for months"
11181,UGH thats bad.  I bet is smelled like crap too
11182,Eggs? I can't stand that stuff. Too many scambled eggs in college!
11183,I can't stand the taste now. They are nasty!
11184,Sometimes that happens. Were you tired?
11185,"Hopefully, you can make it up to your friend next time."
11186,Memories like that are nice
11187,They can be helpful for sure
11188,"Oh, that's always tough and frustrating.  What kept you behind?  Does it happen often?"
11189,That's how my job works too.  Some days I find myself eating dinner very late because we got stuck behind at work.  I try to just stay thankful that I have a job though!  What do you do to decompress once you're home?
11190,oh thats sweet.. put them up this yeqar
11191,thats great.. i love christmas time as well
11192,That's nice of them
11193,MAyabe you can do something nice for them when you get back on your feet.
11194,You sound determined. Go you!
11195,Are you in college?
11196,Really? You should be grateful that you have such a wonderful family. 
11197,Yeah you should be really greatful!
11198,Congratulations to her! You must be so proud!
11199,What will she be specializing in?
11200,That is so exciting you will definitely need it for school what kind did he get you? 
11201,Make sure to save all the notes it will come in handy in the future never know. 
11202,So many people don't take the time anymore. It's so nice to hear you did that for her!
11203,She's one lucky gal. How long have you two been married?
11204,that so cool! I am happy.  whats did he create?
11205,That is amazing.  Maybe one day it will be more that just a science fair project.
11206,what types of things could she do
11207,oh wow .. talented
11208,"He was probably hungry, and thought to himself, that place wasn't so bad huh."
11209,"HAHA, you wanted him gone? maybe he did it to spite you."
11210,Why did you quit?
11211,Can you try out again? OR have you moved on?
11212,Why is that
11213,I understand the feeling
11214,That's terrible. It's a shame that they were not able to keep the place going in her memory. 
11215,I can understand that. Sometimes one person's dream is another person's pain.
11216,That's terrible. I'm glad you stood up for your friend.
11217,Why would your friend want to exclude your other friend? Definitely not cool.
11218,That's so cool!  DO you get to see her often?  Have you ever gotten to see her in person before or did you meet online?
11219,Soooooo exciting!  Are you nervous?  I bet it's going to go amazingly well and you'll have so much fun.  You think she might be the one or not there yet?
11220,Why do you feel ashamed about the movie?
11221,Oh I see! I guess I should watch it as well! I never seen it yet.
11222,Why not?
11223,Well that's the only way you can find out. If she says know there are other girls.
11224,Sounds like you had a good time. What pet is it?
11225,Oh I've never seen one of those. Was it difficult to care for?
11226,were you able to find them somewhere else
11227,time to find something else
11228,"I was too, but then I realized everyone was too and I made a lot of friends!"
11229,I've found in life that all of the friends you need are right around you. 
11230,Going to the park is always nice
11231,I do too
11232,Did they receive it?
11233,Well they will definitely let you know when they do. I would
11234,Oh what happened?
11235,"You did the right thing. I stayed loyal to my work also and when I changed jobs, 20k pay increase."
11236,Yes I agree! Do you think he'll help them win some games?
11237,"Yes, good point. It's probably best that way."
11238,did he get a beat down ?
11239,hah.. thats cool. 
11240,Does that bother you?
11241,I can see why that would bother you.
11242,I bet that will be fun
11243,I do like that food a lot
11244,How'd it go?
11245,congratulations. Now you'll have that freedom to go anywhere you want!
11246,Sounds like a great place! What did you get?
11247,Who was it for?
11248,That's nice. My job has never done that
11249,"Thats amazing, I love to travel.  Where are you going?"
11250,"Awesome,  People underestimate Louisiana,  I love baton rogue "
11251,"Oh no, did anyone notice"
11252,"Thats right,  You have to stay faithful to the one you love."
11253,"Exactly,  People just want what they cant have.  such a bad human trait."
11254,"Sometimes when we're in a bad situation, we do things we wouldn't normally do."
11255,I wish I could look like that
11256,Sweet! Congratulations. Was it difficult? 
11257,"That's great, you must have studied hard."
11258,Aww that's sweet. Did you get to have a party for him or anything?
11259,That sounds lovely. I hope your dad is enjoying his well-earned retirement now.
11260,Im sorry to hear that. What happened?
11261,Oh no. 
11262,"OH my,  does she ever give it back.  Is it alot of money?"
11263,"Its hard to refuse family,  But sometimes that can be taken advantage of."
11264,oh ive heard of that before.. scary stuff
11265,has it happened more than once?
11266,Do you feel like you interview well regularly? were you qualified?
11267,"Then its a no brainer,  I hope that you make alot of money there."
11268,Have you gone out to try to meet people yet?  are you happy about our job?
11269,"Yes i understand its rough,  some people just take time to warm up.  But im willing to bet you will meet someone really cool soon enough."
11270,Oh no!  I don't doubt it.  Diets make you so hungry and gives you crazy cravings for what you can't have.  Did it feel worth it or make you feel miserable?
11271,I have been there and done that.  My vice used to be ice cream.  Then I learned about being high nutrient vegan and started to eat carbs again once I learned about nutrition.  Learning about nutrition made me start thinking about each thing I put in my body.  Like purposeful eating.  It was a tough transition but I never went back.  Just do it for yourself and don't beat yourself up when you mess up.  I know you can do it if I can!
11272,Check out youtube.com and watch the Whole Foods Plant Based Cooking Show and you'll see the yummy desserts you can eat any day of the week without guilt or bingeing.  Delicious! You take care!
11273,I would have been upset too!
11274,Find new people to eat with.
11275,That's good. I always find interesting things whenever I go. 
11276,You should! Alot of the profits from thrift stores go to good causes too!
11277,I'm sorry to hear about your loss.
11278,I think he was able to live a happy life while he was alive.
11279,Well that's a very mature decision of you. It's better than over spending.
11280,No problem. I used to overspend when I was younger and have learned to get it under control lately.
11281,how did you respond
11282,thats probaby a smart choice
11283,"That's understandable, what did you do to pass the time?"
11284,What kind of stuff did you watch?
11285,She sounds like a sweety! Is she coming to gradution?
11286,She must be proud.
11287,That is a great delivery person
11288,That is very nice of him
11289,That's awesome. Any big plans?
11290,Well always be honest.That's a good start.
11291,Why are you upset
11292,That is so sad
11293,sounds like a good day
11294,good for you.. we all need that every once in a while
11295,Payday is always my favorite day of the week! Do you plan to buy anything special? 
11296,"Haha, I love getting chocolate wasted. I like dark chocolate the best. "
11297,"That's great, what will you do when you first see her?"
11298,It's nice you have such a good relationship with her!
11299,That is awful.  Why do people risk their lives and the lives of others just to get a tiny bit ahead in traffic to where there going.  Ridiculous.  I'm glad you weren't hit.
11300,"I saw a guy cut someone off next to me, fly by over the speed limit, and cut a bunch of people off.  All to get ahead.  Then I noticed that I caught up with him because he got stuck at a light and all that craziness didn't even help him."
11301,Why do you say that
11302,I think you should just show up anyway
11303,It is nice that you love learning so much.  What are you studying that you like that much?
11304,What is NWO?
11305,That's wonderful. I bet she is excited.
11306,"That's great. I know she will do her best, I'm sure."
11307,That's great! What is the job
11308,That sounds like a great job
11309,Its hard to maintain that
11310,You can get a adviser
11311,Did your dad love listening to Elvis?
11312,We have that in common!
11313,Oh no! So what happened?
11314,I hope you get an A at least then
11315,That's great to hear. You must be so proud of them.
11316,Do they play instruments?
11317,Your parents sound like wonderful people!
11318,You're welcome. How long have they been together?
11319,"oh that sounds super scary , i hope everything comes back ok"
11320,"dang you sound really calm about it , i have super high anxiety and would be in a state of panice the entire time"
11321,What mountains did you visit?
11322,"I love it there, it is so calming and peaceful there. Except when you end up stuck in traffic in Pigeon Forge."
11323,Its nice to have family
11324,They are always there
11325,oh wow thats awesome
11326,i hope it turns out well for her
11327,"Oh, what's happening on Friday?"
11328,You have to be prepared.
11329,IS bear spray a real thing. I have never been camping
11330,"I see, is that a good thing or bad thing for you?"
11331,"Sorry to hear that. Well yeah, maybe it's for the best"
11332,Loyalty is always good
11333,I am sure they will notice
11334,Congratulations! Hard work does pay off.
11335,What are you studying in school?
11336,"That does sound tough, did it go well at least?"
11337,"That's good, at least you have something fun to look forward to now."
11338,That is a really fun game.  I wonder how they will make it better than the original.
11339,There is nothing worse than spending big money on a game it's no good.
11340,That sounds awesome have you checked out the price for lessons?
11341,Don't worry she'll come around and you're so right it is better for her to start by learning to play guitar first.
11342,Lol still true to this day
11343,Lol. Was there any left when you woke up?
11344,That's what thanksgiving is all about lol
11345,SO that history can repeat itself?
11346,You can do that any day
11347,It happens to the best of us
11348,Hey you win some you lose some. What really matter is that you had fun watching. 
11349,But still maybe you learned something about it?
11350,Oh I'm sorry to hear that. You must be so worried.
11351,Try to get a good night's rest. I hope everything is ok!
11352,That is so great to hear.  Nice to hear someone being happy with the important things in life and not always wanting more.  Its easy to miss things happening all around you if you are never happy with them.
11353,It seems tiring to me when I see people pushing for the next thing.  I feel the same way.  Enjoy family and find what makes your happy and keep like simpler. You must have a great time on holidays with your loved ones!
11354,Did he ever come back?
11355,do they look rough or what
11356,i hope it turns out well for you
11357,"It's been raining a lot here, too, I know that feeling! Did you manage to find something interesting to do inside instead?"
11358,Being cooped up is the worst. Hopefully next weekend is nice and sunny for you and your friends!
11359,I love a person of their word he is a great father keeping his word.
11360,The greatest feeling in the world I have the same feelings towards my dad he always comes through we are lucky. 
11361,Only water? That is crazy lol
11362,Did she confess?
11363,Oh no. Well at least you know she is a terrible liar.
11364,I think we all feel you on that one! 
11365,"There's still some time left to make the most of it, isn't there?"
11366,That is very sweet
11367,I hope to have that one day
11368,Sucks that no one told you!
11369,It happens. I hope you're not too embarassed.
11370,thats awesome .. how long has she been learning?
11371,keep up the good work.
11372,Yes that was an exciting moment for him and for the team as well!
11373,"I have a feeling that with Lebron on their team, they are going to do just that."
11374,"Oh wow, that is so scary! I would be worried for my family safety, maybe get a guard dog? My dog always alerts me to sounds."
11375,"Good idea, you can never be too safe when it comes to the safety of your family. I hope the police is watching your neighborhood more closely since the reports."
11376,"That's a good thing, right? So the families can get the help they need?"
11377,I can't begin to imagine how difficult it must be for the kids in that situation. It seems the school really has their back.
11378,What game are you waiting for?
11379,I used to love those games growing up so I can't judge you for it!
11380,Hey it's ok. We all do stupid things when we are young. 
11381,Give it time. I'm sure he will come around. 
11382,That is so great I love dogs they are so sweet and your best friend for life.
11383,They come with hard work have to walk and feed them but you will get back into your groove.
11384,enjoy it while it lasts
11385,oh sorry to hear that then 
11386,OH no. Was it really late?
11387,I watch too many murder shows to do that.
11388,"Oh, that's disappointing. What was wrong with it?"
11389,Ewwwwwww...the devil's topping. Did you send it back? 
11390,"That sounds horribly boring. You can always take this time to do some house work that you put off, so that it will be ready when your friends get back in town."
11391,You're welcome. I'm sure you'll make it  they will be back soon. You could also always watch some Netflix.
11392,What did you use the $5 for? Something good hopefully!
11393,Sorry to hear that. You tried at least and your intentions were good.
11394,You will have your day
11395,Oh no! I've done that before.  Did you call them and ask for a grace period so you didn't build fines?  We all make mistakes like that so don't beat yourself up.
11396,Those kinds of things are part of life and its better for our minds if we let them go and move on or see the humor in it.  I hope it didn't hurt your standing with the company.  You just reminded me to pay my internet bill! thanks!
11397,Was it any good? Frozen foods can be weird.
11398,"That is so annoying. You're better off buying fresh on the day, even if it's inconvenient. "
11399,Are you happy for them
11400,Its natural so its okay
11401,I hate storms.
11402,I geet scared that we will lose power.
11403,thats good.. seem like a good employee
11404,there arent a lot of dedicated people like you. keep it up
11405,"If you need to take time off, then I'm sure your company will understand. "
11406,What ever need you need to do. 
11407,That's great. Summer classes can be tough. Because its summer
11408,Well Im glad for him. He must be pretty determined.
11409,Haha that's a smart strategy. What kind of things do you like to buy?
11410,Oh I love seafood though. It's worth it I'd say lol.
11411,What was the lie?
11412,Were you cheating?
11413,Thats just being a good parent
11414,"Aw, that's so sweet of you. Doggos can be so rewarding. "
11415,Is he an older dog or a puppy?
11416,I don't doubt that you're feeling good about yourself! Are you getting the lump sum of monthly payments?
11417,"Hey, you can't complain about that! Who knows, you may end up using your skills to win the major jackpot."
11418,good for you
11419,How come no one would walk with you. I would be afraid too.
11420,Are you able to afford one?
11421,"Good things come to those who wait, I know it's hard now because your friend got one but it'll work out for you"
11422,You should to them before you do that
11423,Well maybe should be civil
11424,Was the cake god? Sometimes you have to have your cake and eat it too haha. 
11425,That sounds so yummy! See you much have needed those calories with skipping meals. Sounds like your a great baker as well.
11426,Ugh. That's the worst. Have you called him/her? 
11427,That's so frustrating. Ask for a break on the rent next month!
11428,"im sorry to hear that , whant happened ?"
11429,"always believe in yourself, and dont let others opinions dictate your feelings "
11430,Don't worry about it. Everybody messes up sometimes!
11431,"It just take a lot of practice, but you will get there!"
11432,what was it
11433,oh thats sweet
11434,"That is great.  Congatulations!!!! Did you get a big raise, too?"
11435,It always feel good to get what you deserve!
11436,Oh ok! Is that a bad thing or do you enjoy being single?
11437,Oh yeah I know what you mean. Have you tried dating?
11438,Yeah it was very different last time i tried! But I ended up meeting my partner through friends. You'll get there!
11439,"I do too, its okay"
11440,sorry to hear that.. what happened
11441,hopefully she didnt suffer.
11442,I hate that for you
11443,I can understand tat
11444,"Oh wow, any special reason for him doing that?"
11445,How sweet of him.
11446,That's always so fun to see everything that's gone on in your life.  Do you have a favorite moment that was captured in a picture?
11447,They grow up so fast!  How many kids do you have?
11448,Sounds like you are so blessed though!  I know you must miss them while they're away.  You have been a priceless influence on them.  They will always love you!
11449,That's too bad. You're not quitting are you?
11450,They will get over it
11451,That's a pretty wild story. Why do you think the aliens chose you in particular?
11452,"Well be sure to lock your doors and windows before bed tonight, hopefully that will keep them out."
11453,"Oh wow, that's a pretty scary movie.  I'd want company while watching it too."
11454,I get what you mean.  Some films just aren't for some people.  It takes some courage to watch.
11455,Good luck.  But besides it being scary it's a good film in general.  Hope you two can enjoy it.
11456,"oh thats really nice , my friend in new york also has to do a test soon to get a promotion, i hope u get it - u can do it !!!"
11457,"promotions are always good more money ,and a better life i believe in you !!!"
11458,"I think that you are absolutely right!  Thanksgiving is the best!  I love the food, and family.  Are your family coming to you, or are you going to the?"
11459,Is the brother from Germany coming home?
11460,"That sucks, Did you reschedule?"
11461,I hate when that happens. Especially when the same people do it over and over.
11462,Why would she do that
11463,It wasn't Dave Ramsey was it?
11464,Ha I took a shot in the dark. I have heard him recommended a lot for people who want to learn how to pay down debt and save money.
11465,Have you found it?
11466,"It very well could have been. I'm sorry, that sucks."
11467,That is terrible. 
11468,I don't know. They should be locked up though. Hurting a person is next.
11469,"Oh, that is nerve-racking.You have to be on-guard. Did they behave themselves? "
11470,Ugh. I don't understand that either. And they make everyone so anxious just be existing. 
11471,That would be great wouldn't it? They have it made!
11472,Yeah but you also wouldn't live as long either. 
11473,I know that feeling.  I have a husband and a boyfriend living here and it still feels empty.
11474,Maybe maybe LOL.. I have four dogs.. argh!
11475,It's nice to have generous friends.  Did you have something good?
11476,"Ohhh, delicious. "
11477,Its nice to have a reliable person like that
11478,I am sure he will do a good job
11479,"oh cool, what was it about?"
11480,"Wow that's nice, how old is she?"
11481,Did they have a good reason?
11482,Well maybe you can reschedule and do something even more fun
11483,"I am sorry, how important were they"
11484,"I am sorry, that sounds stressful"
11485,It's always nice to visit with friends you haven't seen in a while.
11486,I'm happy to hear you enjoyed yourself!
11487,More money is always nice
11488,Did you have fun? 
11489,It's always nice when an event lives up to the hype. Was it at a bar or a house or where?
11490,That's great. I wish my daughter was determined like that.
11491,In the classes that she likes. It is pretty frustrating for me
11492,I hear 35 is the new 25!
11493,I hope they don't either! Sounds like the perfect birthday celebration.
11494,There are some apps that allow a friend to follow your progress as you home. Will that make you feel safer?
11495,"Ducks are scary, but they are more scared of you than you are of them. "
11496,Whats it about?
11497,oooh all that physics makes my head spin
11498,Oh love! I can only imagine the feelings you must be experiencing. Do you have a good support system in place?
11499,"I'm so glad you have people to lean on -- though obviously, your experience is *yours* and no one can know exactly how you're feeling. Are you familiar with Kris Carr, with your interest in a plant-based approach to diet?"
11500,"She's very inspiring -- you'll love her! Sending you ALL the best in healing vibes, love, and light!"
11501,"Oh well, there is always next time"
11502,Just try and keep in touch when you can
11503,"I'm really glad to hear that! What kind of job is it, if you don't mind me asking?"
11504,"Oh, that sounds pretty cool. I kind of had my eye on a career like that when I was in school, but ultimately didn't go that route. What will you be doing specifically?"
11505,I bet that was disgusting! I would bring a noseplug from now on.
11506,"I love hiking, I can't imagine happening upon something so gross. Would probably ruin my hike as well!"
11507,That's really sweet of you. I hope your cat is doing better!
11508,"Well I'm sure with you taking care of him, he'll be fine!"
11509,That does sound fun though
11510,I hope you have fun
11511,That's what pictures are for. Are you guys ever going to live together?
11512,We that's good. The photos will keep you close
11513,"The snails? Yikes. Well, I've always thought it probably gets a worse rap than it actually should, and probably doesn't taste that bad. Half of why I think it's probably gross is simply because they made it seem gross in old cartoons. So, how did it taste?"
11514,"Yeah, that's true! Especially since you were on a cruise, it sounds like it's all a part of the experience. At least you can say you didn't chicken out. I'm glad you decided to go that way, because now you have a special memory tied to that vacation;"
11515,"Oh man, I feel for you.  Kids grow up so fast.  Do you feel prepared for it?"
11516,I hear you.  I have a 8 year old daughter and it feels like she was born yesterday.  
11517,That sucks? Did you see anything?
11518,I can imagine. I had a car stolen once while I was at work. Broke my heart
11519,I've never seen it. Why do you like it?
11520,"That's great, so you enjoy looking after them?"
11521,"Yeah I can understand that! Well at least they have each other, and hopefully they will grow more social together"
11522,"That happens sometimes. Sometimes life just gets in the way. Heck, sometimes you just decide you can't physically do a night out, and that's okay, too. I'm sure they'd understand no matter what. Maybe you can make it up to them somehow."
11523,"Maybe take a few days to think it over, and then when the weekend comes, think of a way to surprise them in order to make it up to them. Or if nothing else, just be as honest as possible and not try to cover anything up when you need to bail on them. They'll appreciate that the most."
11524,"I am sorry, I guess some friends just argue like that"
11525,I am sure you guys will make up
11526,I love visiting breweries! What's your favorite kind of beer?
11527,"Not my favorite but I had a really good one the other day with some kind of fruit in it, I could have downed a gallon of the stuff."
11528,Ohhh gotta hate that friend!   What do you drive?
11529,I drive a gianormous conversion van
11530,In what ways do you mean?
11531,Wow they were over $2 when I was 18!
11532,"Wow, congratulations to him! He must have been studying very hard for his exams."
11533,I'm sure he has a bright future ahead! Tell him to keep up the good work.
11534,"oh, dear. That sounds lonely. How are you holding up?"
11535,"I can imagine. But you'll make new connections there, I'm sure."
11536,I know how you feel.  I moved about 3 hours away from my hometown for school and stayed for 3 years and hated it.  I moved back to my hometown and am so happy now.  I'm sorry you're having a tough time.  Have you gotten out and tried to meet people?
11537,"I would go with your gut.  Sometimes things don't work out, but you might just need more time to meet people and might want to hang in there.  I hope you meet a best friend soon!"
11538,That is a great friend! I'm happy you were able to see your family.
11539,She sounds like one of a king! Not many people are that generous.
11540,Wow that's really frustrating. 
11541,Oh yuck! That is so gross!
11542,"I do, too.  We just need to take better care of the resources we have and plant more trees.  Do you do anything ""green""."
11543,If we could just get more people on board to do that we would be on the right track.
11544,I am glad that he did. It is always good to stay hopeful.
11545,That's great. Health scares are very real and scary.
11546,I LOVED Disneyland growing up! Did you go often? How old were you and what was your favorite ride?
11547,"Ha! I hear you on that. I also loved the Matterhorn! And the Haunted House. We used to spend summers in Tucson with my grandparents, and they would drive us to Disneyland every year ;-)"
11548,That's awesome! What a nice surprise. And congratulations on graduating. That's a big accomplishment. What did you graduate in? 
11549,"Oh, very cool. I thought about majoring in English, too, but decided to go a different route. I hope your new degree helps you land the job you want! You're now in the exciting unknown part of your life."
11550,Just try and teach them to be more careful with them
11551,I am sure it will get beter
11552,That's so nice of him to do. No one wants to help anyone out these days but I'm glad for you.
11553,There's always Uber!
11554,I am so sorry to hear that! Cancer is such a horrible disease.
11555,"I've actually lost two family members last year, so I can relate. It's something that will stick with you until the day you die."
11556,That's unfortunate. Does she know that it happened?
11557,I am sorry to hear that. Maybe next time you can just ask her.
11558,Best of luck to you. The tension and nerves must be killing you!
11559,"It's a tough market out there, but I have faith that you get what you desire!"
11560,I am sorry you have that. It must be rough
11561,I can only imagine
11562,"Wow, congratulations on getting a new job!  I think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job.  What do you do?"
11563,That sounds fun. Have you done something like it before or is the whole kind of job new to you?  Good luck and I know you'll do great!  Act confident even if you don't feel like it. Sometimes that can help.
11564,"Ah, that's rough. That was a very bold move on your part. But sometimes fortune favors the bold, as they say. I think you'll be happy later on not having to wonder ""what if."" Still though, she could have maybe been more discrete about things."
11565,"Ah, I see. Well, it's a good thing you were rejected thing, maybe. At least now you know what kind of a bullet you dodged. Plus, this is just another step in your overall confidence and character building. The next time you ask someone else out, it will be easier."
11566,That is very nice of him.
11567,"Yes, a very cool thing."
11568,Sometimes that can be a good thing? It's not always so bad!
11569,Maybe next weekend will be better for you!
11570,I hate when those come around
11571,I am sure it will soon
11572,"you should not feel bad ,we all need alone time"
11573,"honesty is great and all , but sometimes you need some time to yourself, i feel you on that tho"
11574,"Oh wow, that's great! Only bad thing is he will be very busy with two jobs."
11575,That's great to hear!
11576,There is nothing wrong with that at all. I've done it a few times before. Nobody in the theater knows or cares that you're there alone.
11577,"If you always wait for somebody to come with you, you may miss out on a movie that you want to see as well. So there's that."
11578,oh thats cool
11579,I'm glad to hear something positive happened to you. Were you able to do something fun or productive with the time off? And what was the occasion?
11580,"Ah, pretty cool. It's nice that you decided to have family time instead of just alone time. I bet they were excited, too. Hopefully work rewards you more often like that."
11581,I would love to do that as well
11582,I would love to go to hawaii
11583,"That's great! It's hard to do that sometimes, especially on the weekends!"
11584,I'm proud of you for sticking to it!
11585,Oh yeah? What kind of animal do you think it was?
11586,Maybe it was an armadillo. I get them in my yard sometimes.
11587,"Oh no, what did they say to convince you?"
11588,Maybe I'm too gullible as well because that would convince me!
11589,That is a relief. Did any coworker friends get laid off?
11590,"I've been there. It's so sad, but it will get better. "
11591,Maybe you can change that jealous energy into positive energy! Do some research into fitness and start a new journey.
11592,"One tip I tell people is that they don't need to change WHAT they eat, only how much. Calorie intake is the important factor, not what type of calories."
11593,"Holy cow, that's terrible. I really feel for you. My dad had that happen to him and his dog when he was young, and he's told me about it as a warning to make sure I'm safe with ours. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I hope you get through the grieving process okay."
11594,"I would definitely take as long as you need, so you don't put unhealthy pressure or expectation on the animal to live up to a memory it can't live up to. But if you feel comfortable with the idea, then I would consider it when the time is right. You'll know when that is."
11595,"That's great, what did he give you?"
11596,Do you know why he gave it to you?
11597,Oh no! That's not good at all. It's hard to diagnose things sometimes
11598,Well I'm glad he got some antibiotics for it. I hope that helped enough!
11599,Oh now that's exciting! I moved two years ago and it was a very weird process. I was happy to have a new home but anxious at the same time.
11600,Well that's great. I'm happy to hear you guys are getting out of a bad home.
11601,"Oh, I totally understand.  It's frustrating when you feel like you're putting in the same effort (or more!) and it works better for other people.  "
11602,"Well, it's good that at least you're making progress!  It would be crazy frustrating if you weren't.  Congrats on your hard work paying off. "
11603,"Ah yes, does it bring back good memories? Nostalgia is a powerful thing."
11604,I'm so glad that you had the chance to make those memories with your cousins!
11605,"That sure is embarrassing, did he get talked to about his behavior? "
11606,"I agree, at that age kids should definitely know better and think before doing something. Unbelievable. "
11607,You should be proud. These are the moments you are never going to want to forget.
11608,"Yeah, but don't worry. More memories are yet to come!"
11609,"Your youthful vigor? You think you're too old now? You're only too old if you allow yourself to be. My girlfriend's 90-year-old grandfather was a full-of-life WWII vet who lit up the room when he came in. Of course, you're not as physically active, but you have to learn to utilize your life in different ways."
11610,"Well, maybe it's an opportunity for introspection. For you to take time out of your day to think about what you need and want, and what are the best ways to achieve that. Maybe you need a better diet, or sleep schedule, or meditation, or an exercise routine. Sometimes you have to spend energy to feel energized. It's a slow process in the beginning, but it can be life-changing."
11611,Any plans for Friday?
11612,That's awesome! I bet these next few days will fly by
11613,I bet you were! What kind of laptop was it? 
11614,My husband also has a Lenovo. He really likes it!
11615,Wowza! That's impressive. I wonder how long until he's called up.
11616,You will be able to say you saw him before he was famous! 
11617,"I'm really sorry to hear that... That's the worst scenario too, because you're parked and probably not even there, so you were completely powerless in the situation, and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you. Maybe there's something that can be worked out, since you just purchased it."
11618,"There has to be something. It can't just be this weird vulnerable loophole. I really hope so, for your case, because that's just unfair. I'm sure your work will understand, but it's still a crummy situation that is probably affecting all areas of your life. Transportation gets taken for granted. Hope things get better soon."
11619,I'm so glad you got to visit with them!  I know how you feel to be far from family and home alone.  Take heart that you are loved by your family and friends even when they aren't around.
11620,I can see why its even harder on you when they leave.  That's wonderful that they are such a part of your life.  Take care and get out with friends soon to brighten your spirits!
11621,That's quite scary!  Are you able to see who it is?
11622,You might want to call 911 if they continue banging on the door.  Better safe than sorry!
11623,"Wow, how long has he been juggling for?"
11624,"I wonder how people figure that thing out about themselves? Very cool, though."
11625,Sometimes you just have to concede defeat. I admire your resigned attitude.
11626,Then it was your lucky day. I usually follow someone like that and they will end up getting pulled over before me.
11627,"Oh, no.  I think I see where this is headed.  "
11628,"LOL.  Do you really think so?  That has happened to me before.  Sometimes, it's just too hard to pass up.  Thank you for sharing.  "
11629,Congratulations on making a plan and sticking with it. What kind of diet are you doing?
11630,You can do anything (realistically) as long as you stay consistent and take it one day at a time!
11631,did it bite you!
11632,oh thats cool then
11633,That would really anger me as well.  What did you do?  Did you find the person who did it?
11634,"Yeah, it blows my mind that people think they can damage other peoples belonging and just go about their day.  "
11635,I'm happy for you! Everyone deserves to be excited about life.
11636,Thank you very much. Much success to you!
11637,"Your family was being polite. If I did that my family would order a pizza, hah."
11638,It's all good. Maybe you should try something simple like Hamburger Helper. Can't really  mess that up.
11639,"I didn't even know they were making another, I loved the first!"
11640,That is friggin' awesome! I sure hope they can keep up the quality in the upcoming movies.
11641,Congratulation.
11642,You had a good idea. Each of us need to find the correct way to lose weight.
11643,"Wow, good luck.  I hope it all goes well. It sounds like you're confident that it will. Have you done one before?"
11644,I know you're do great then!  Hope it brings you a lot of success!
11645,Really?  That is awesome.  I used to watch reruns of that show all the time.
11646,I will have to try to watch it.  Sounds like a good time
11647,Those poor dogs! I hate puppy mills so much and unfortunately I live in an area where they are very common.
11648,There are laws here but they find ways around them. People are cruel and only care about money.
11649,Oooh I don't like owls... they creep me out
11650,was it big
11651,did you get to keep them?
11652,thats awesome
11653,"That is awesome, did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected? "
11654,That must mean you're a hard worker. You should keep at it then!
11655,"I hate that. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. That's such an awkward situation, because you don't want to come off as high maintenance and ask them to stop, but it'd be so easy for them to have better manners, too. I wish I had better advice. Maybe go to HR?"
11656,"Yeah, absolutely. That's what I meant earlier, too, about being high maintenance. I don't know, maybe earbuds? But I'm sure you've tried that. Who knows how they would respond if you asked them personally, and if they actually did improve, they'd probably just forget and revert back in a few days anyway."
11657,Wow!  That is impressive!  You must be really prod of yourself!
11658,Haha!  That's funny!  I work out to drink and eat bad food as well!  Awesome achievement with your running!  Keep at it!
11659,"Hey, honest mistake. Obviously you didn't come up with some dumb lie and make it seem like they made the mistake and not you. You owned up to it. I'm sure they appreciate that more than you would figure."
11660,"I'm glad! It's the honest truth. Everyone screws up. And I bet it will motivate you to never make that mistake again, too. So in the end, they have someone who's sharper about things. Good to hear it worked out in your favor."
11661,"yes dude the world is a trip, i made many friends over the years online and when i bump into them i make sure i go up to them and chit chat and shake hands, you never know when someone will pass away , "
11662,"i have in real life friends , and a regular job , but because of back problems and sciatica ive made many friends online i consider to be like brothers social media has let me make relationships while in bed lol"
11663,That's so unfair. I would complain very loudly if that happened to me!
11664,I feel your pain. Life is really unfair sometimes.
11665,Stranger things is one of my favorite shows!  It stinks that the next season has been pushed to next summer though.
11666,I feel ya.  The kids will be all grown up by then!
11667,That is awesome!  He is such an amazing athlete!  Any team that has him is lucky!
11668,I guarantee they will!  That's raw talent right there!
11669,wow .. so am i .. i could not imagine doing that. its great that you are going to do it though
11670,i wish you good luck.. 
11671,"Oh, my dad use to play with those all the time when we were young and he'd let us touch them!"
11672,"I never did want to hold it, but I was curious enough to touch it! They're actually kind of cute."
11673,Oh no! I hate when that happens... hopefully your computers holds on a little longer for it to go back down
11674,Well good luck! I know how frustrating that can be
11675,"Wow, why are they still shooting off fireworks? Don't they know it's a one day holiday?"
11676,I agree. It must be hard to get any sleep. I feel bad for any animals in the area too!
11677,yea i hear that... it was much better back then
11678,that i think you are right
11679,That is impressive. He must have been prepared well for the switch.
11680,Good for him. It takes me forever to find a job.
11681,"Wow, how exciting! Boy or girl? "
11682,Yeah I'm sure! Is this your first? 
11683,Well congratulations! :D
11684,wow that's such an awesome surprise!
11685,that's a great husband and best friend
11686,Where were you at? Why couldn't you go home? Sounds frustrating.
11687,Oh that is frustrating. I bet you were very annoyed.
11688,oh wow.. first time going to france?
11689,thats awesome .. i wish i could go there.. 
11690,That sounds lonely. Maybe you should try to hang out with some of your classmates?
11691,I hear you. At least it is only for a month. Maybe you can make some weekend trips to do fun things.
11692,That's hilarious!  Did you try to play it off like you meant to do that?
11693,"Well, at least you were honest about it.  I bet you will never put your shirt on inside out again!  So, consider it a lesson learned!"
11694,It is always good to take the time to reflect on happy memories.  I do that from time to time myself
11695,I am glad you were able to look back fondly and remember that good times.
11696,"Oh, man!  That is a nightmare!  Was your boss upset with you?"
11697,"Yeah, it happens to the best of us.  You just have to try and forget about it and move forward."
11698,That is great! Do you have any fun plans?
11699,Oh wow! That will be really fun!
11700,whats wrong with your cat
11701,im sorry to hear that.. she will be in peace soon enough.
11702,That would make me mad. Did you know who did it?
11703,That's too bad. Maybe they could check security cameras for you.
11704,time to look for one that deserves you
11705,i hope you find happiness .. doesnt look like its gonna be with him.. goodluck though!
11706,I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
11707,I would be heart-broken as well. You know you can always talk to me if you need to
11708,"Oh no, why are all the pets dying. It is so sad when that happens."
11709,I bet you will miss your feline friend. Hopefully they are in a better place now.
11710,I would have done the same! I don't like snakes
11711,I found a garden snake in my yard the other day and despite it being little it still creeped me out
11712,That was very nice. Why couldn't you have a baby shower?
11713,"Yes, that is nice. A baby shower, just without the people. Still great!"
11714,Oh no! Inquiring minds want to know... is there plans for a second date?
11715,"Well, you don't want to date someone who doesn't like coffee anyway. :)"
11716,That's great! How does that make you feel?
11717,You should go out and meet friends! Go out and do hobbies that you like. I bet you'll meet some new friends. Are you in a big city?
11718,Who let him out? Did he run away?
11719,Oh that is so sad. I hope you find him!
11720,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes when you ""give up"", someone good comes along"
11721,Maybe you can get a pet to distract you. It could even help socialize like if you get a dog and go to a dog park
11722,That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time.
11723,Yeah I know how it is. My kids drive me nuts now. They are 8 and 9.
11724,"Man, that sucks. Are you going to go back and return it or did you eat it already?"
11725,I say in that case don't worry about it. Mistakes happen.
11726,That should have been scary?
11727,Nice. How did you find the city?
11728,It mean that you are smart.
11729,You never know.
11730,That's great! I know that is an amazing feeling to have.
11731,That's wonderful. A car is one of the most useful purchases one can make I think.
11732,"Ouch, I bet that must have hurt!"
11733,That could be some trauma there... but I am sure you will get back into the swing of things (no pun intended).
11734,That is unfortunate. Did they reschedule the picnic?
11735,I'm glad you feel better knowing that it will happen next week.
11736,That's awesome! How did it go?
11737,That is so cool. I'm glad you found your soulmate!
11738,How did you find that out? Ultrasound or intuition?
11739,Ah I have two girls too and remember the same old wive's tale haha. Good luck on that boy!
11740,Pretty names. Mine are Kaitlyn and Alyssa.
11741,Thats awesome! I hope the visit goes well :)
11742,Oh wow so the pressure is on to make a good impression haha
11743,That's great! Good luck! That attitude says a lot.
11744,That's a recipe for success. I think you'll crush it.
11745,Wow that's a bold move. How is he getting along with that?
11746,"That's great! I think as long as he is happy, he's doing whatever is right for him."
11747,"That's great. I'm a native spaker, but from what I understand English is very hard to actually learn"
11748,They absolutely do. Kids are like sponged. It's been said that it's much easier for kids to learn multiple languages than adults
11749,"what kind of exam is it , and you sound confident you got this "
11750,"That is awesome to hear , preparation will help you knock this out like a champ"
11751,That's awesome! You must have felt so proud of your achievements.
11752,That's good. I was never very good at math in school.
11753,Were you doing it in a public place? Weed can do that to someone.
11754,You may want to smoke less next time. Do it in moderation.
11755,That's too bad.  Have you given serious thought to trying to lose weight?
11756,"Hmmm.   I encourage you to keep trying.   Even if you don't ge tto your dieal weight, just getting halfway would show trememndous progress."
11757,That is so romantic. I also try to surprise my girlfriend occasionally with some little gifts
11758,Such things even though may seem little have much positive impact on couple's relationship
11759,Wow good for him. Now he can drive you around.
11760,He is moving forward pretty fast. But that means you can ride with him that much sooner.
11761,Wow im sorry to hear that. It sucks when something goes wrong at a job you've been there long
11762,I'm glad you found a job quick! That must have felt a little good to tell them at least
11763,"Don't you hate how ""customer service"" has no service anymore?  Did you get the refund at least?"
11764,I'm sorry that you had to experience that.  It's totally unfair!
11765,What makes life so hard right now?
11766,Very true. What would you want to do in the 60's?
11767,Why you don't want to join the comic book club?
11768,I understand. You could find a book club outside school.
11769,"Oh, that's wonderful!  Tell them congratulations for me! You must be bursting with pride!  "
11770,Do they have any aspirations yet or are they just figuring out life?
11771,"Congrats! Time really does fly by, doesn't it? What was your favorite moment from it all/"
11772,"Aww, that does sound quite lovely. Before you know it it'll be 20 years! Any special plans then?"
11773,Well studying is a good place to start. Do you feel confident about how well you will do?
11774,"That's a good attitude to have. Good luck, I'm sure you'll do great (assuming you keep the procrastination in check)!"
11775,Hi
11776,What did you do to protect yourself?
11777,That's awesome! I've never been to Colorado but I hear great things! haha
11778,"11 years is a long time, I hope you have a great time!"
11779,"oh that sucks, were you able to get anything"
11780,wow that's great!
11781,I'm glad he was able to help.  Was the battery dead?
11782,"Yes, because a dead battery is much easier to fix than a busted starter or ignition switch.  :D  "
11783,Wow that is awesome! Congratulations. I am already 31 
11784,How many people are invited? and where is it gonna be?
11785,"wow! That sounds wonderful, I wish I were there too.  Are u wishing a special gift? "
11786,"Oh man, long distance is hard."
11787,Have you met in person?
11788,So sorry to hear that. What happened? Is it something serious?
11789,I hope the surgery went successfully and with no hassle. I had a friend who went through the same thing. Wish you all the best
11790,Hey bro. or sis......you are talking to me now.....hope it helps some.
11791,Just concentrate on the here and now......Your partner will be back soon.
11792,Did he get mad at you?
11793,"Buy him something sweet, like a chocolate cake, it usually helps."
11794,"It's always good to go to places that make you feel younger again, it brings back good memories."
11795,"Thats great, never lose touch with your childhood."
11796,That sounds fun! What system do you play it on? I haven't played Mario Kart since the Wii.
11797,I definitely have a Switch on my Christmas list! Maybe I will get myself one for my birthday.
11798,That's wonderful! I love those 'surprise visit' occassions. Sadly my parents would need to fly across the country to do that and it's just not feasible given my work schedule
11799,"Oh, your situation knocks mine out for sure. That's great that they did that. Traveling is unfortunatly, very expensive "
11800,Eeeek! I can't watch those anymore like I used to when I was a teenager. I bet you got scared!  Those replay in my mind over and over.
11801,"Once, I was watching a horror movie a loooong time ago and the phone was ringing in the movie and then didn't work all of a sudden and then it happened to me and my friend in real life right at the same time! It was crazy but it was just a storm outside. ha ha."
11802,"Same thing I guess, it's hard to imagine such situations."
11803,I'm sorry. Do you enjoy having the apartment to yourself?
11804,That's true. I hope you find someone new to share it with.
11805,Wow! I'm actually really jealous. How did that make you feel?
11806,What all did you buy?
11807,Would you like to buy me something? I'm just kidding. That's great; you deserve it. 
11808,What even made you think about that?
11809,"Think of positive thinks instead, you have control over that."
11810,"Dang, don't you hate when that happens. What did he promise you this time?"
11811,Well make sure it is going straight to you. No drinks or smokes unless you say so.
11812,Would you believe I have never seen a Star Wars movie? Don't hate me lol
11813,I am a fan of GAme of Thrones though.
11814,"Right!? One of the best shows of all time in my opinion, what are we suppose to do with our time?"
11815,"Good choice, I forgot what outside is"
11816,That's nice. I bet he appreciated it.
11817,You're a good person. Everyone isnt so lucky.
11818,Are you enrolling into army?
11819,"Well good luck, its a tough life."
11820,That's a big time in someone's life.  Do you feel ready for this new phase?
11821,How far away will you be?
11822,"Oh man, that is a long way.  Do you have family visits planned so you have something to look forward to and help you get through?"
11823,"You might fall in love with it and end up sticking it out.  You never know, but leaving family is hard."
11824,Oh wow! What an accomplishment!
11825,What kind of doctor will she be?
11826,Oh. I don't know how medical school works. I am studying srt history.
11827,"That is awesome, what kind of cat was it?"
11828,"That is great, make sure you pass it on to your kids as well!"
11829,"im so excited for you, my friend has gone twice he said a lot of people are passed out drunk on the street , and even taco bell sells alcohol very weird place"
11830,"i would love going one day as well , just ignore the drunk people i bet your gonna have a blast"
11831,I just almost threw up a bit when you described it to me.  So I understand
11832,I cannot imagine anyone wanting to drink that without losing a bet
11833,Ugh I hate crap like that.  Why can't credit be shared?  Does it always have to be so cutthroat?
11834,Well All's well that ends well.  I'm sure glad they were able to see through such a cheap ploy.
11835,Hey people get what the deserve in this world sometimes.  Just be glad justice is served.
11836,Holidays are a great time for family. I love that too.
11837,Do you get to gether for all holidays?
11838,What did they do this time? Kids are always getting into stuff.
11839,Those bums. Maybe then need to be reminded who is the boss.
11840,"That's awesome! It really pays not to burn bridges, you never know when someone from your past can help you out like that."
11841,"I'm happy for you. If only more bosses were like that, the workforce would be a lot happier and productive I think."
11842,"Oh no, I can imagine how you must have felt when you realized.  Did you get sick?"
11843,I can understand that too....  Did you double check the bread before the next sandwich?
11844,That is not cool. I sure hope they fix their mess up quick!
11845,I would definitely give them a bad review and try to speak to someone higher up.
11846,That's terrible. Was anyone hurt?
11847,You're lucky. That could have been really bad. Did he stop?
11848,He shouldn't have a license.
11849,"That's a very stressful time in a person's life, but I'm sure she'll adapt!"
11850,Does she have a good group of close friends? Maybe she's confident because of that.
11851,Growing up is hard at every stage in a person's life
11852,I'm glad you have a good plan for success this semester.  Did you pass last semester?
11853,That is really good.  I've found that a good schedule is the backbone of a good year.  It sounds like you've got it figured out.
11854,Is the place nice? Have you seen it yet?
11855,Well that's good. You guys will enjoy each other.
11856,Oh no! How did you and your family do? Was the house damaged?
11857,"Hopefully that never will happen to you again, that is terrible."
11858,I can imagine you are nervous.  What will you do?
11859,"Well, I wish you the best of luck.  I understand that is a stressful situation"
11860,"I have never heard of silverfish, but if you have to hire an exterminator that sounds serious. I hope you are ok!"
11861,That is really annoying to hear. I would be so furious if I was in your position.
11862,Wow that is a long time. Why is it taking so long?
11863,That is pretty annoying for sure. I hope they get moved in so they stop bothering you.
11864,Golf? I could never get into it.
11865,Do you play too?
11866,That's no good.  What did he do?
11867,"That is so annoying.  Have you reported him, or asked him to be sure to close the mailbox?"
11868,That's great. I can't wait to retire and travel
11869,Are you goig to travel?
11870,It's always good to start them young! Hopefully they love it and stick to it.
11871,I agree. Kids can get a lot more out of sticking to those types of sports other than just physical exercise. It teaches them great personality traits like dedication and hard work.
11872,"omg that is so scary , especially if you took all your little ones with you that day"
11873,"refund and tickets wont do anything , someone messed up big and they need to be fired "
11874,It happens. Maybe you should hide one somewhere in case you get locked out again.
11875,Well I had to call my landlord once to get back in my place. I know how it feels.
11876,That is awesome for your kid! Now she knows hard work pays off.
11877,It is always a great feeling when you see your kids succeed. 
11878,"Wow, that sounds pretty special. Are you his only child?"
11879,"Uh oh, well only have kids if you really want them. "
11880,Wow! He houldl do competitions. I have only seen that on TV
11881,Must have been pretty cool to watch. How much do you bench press?
11882,I love cereal too. What type do your kids enjoy?
11883,"Oh wow, how is it expiring already?"
11884,"I agree, they should check their dates more closely!"
11885,"Always gamble in moderation, how much did you lose? Enough to get the hubby mad? "
11886,"If you ever need help with a gambling problem talk to someone, never keep it bottled up."
11887,How did it feel?
11888,"You need to get into more relationships, then you'll enjoy it more."
11889,That's kind of rude for them not to invite you. You should tell them you were hurt.
11890,You are right. Now you know who your real friends are.
11891,True. i think the store should introduce some policies for punishing such individuals with fines
11892,"Excellent. When i was visiting Turkey, they had the same thing for carts used to carry your luggage"
11893,He sucks
11894,Forget him. There are soo many girls out there.
11895,Why? Is there something wrong with the daycare?
11896,"I'm sorry, I think you are making the right choice."
11897,There's nothing wrong with that. Unless you're mean
11898,Maybe you shoud pretend you are still at work until you get the hang of it.
11899,"Wow, and you just walked out the store with them?"
11900,"Oh, I thought you stole them, but I've done that before too. Not to that extent though."
11901,Thats sad to hear. Do you have any old pictures of it that you could look at?
11902,Maybe you could go visit it sometime if you have the opportunity. That would be a great vacation idea.
11903,Sorry to hear that.Are you still locked out?
11904,"Well, you just have to be patient."
11905,Why? I will be your friend if you need friends.
11906,Take a chance and go to a coffee shop or bar.
11907,Really?? Are you over-protective of your kids?
11908,How many kids are you talking about?
11909,Don't worry. Ask some help from your friends and family.
11910,Happy to hear! have a happy home!
11911,I'm ready to meet my interviewer tomorrow.
11912,How did it go? Was it his first sleep over?
11913,That's impressive for a 3 year old!  I didn't have my first sleepover til I was 6.
11914,I have never had that. We don't have them here. Good thing though lol
11915,I would have done the same.
11916,Did you tell him anything?
11917,Well it's his driveway I guess.
11918,Why was it sad?
11919,"My condolences, I hope you are doing alright now."
11920,Oh no! Why was it so bad?
11921,"That bad huh? Well, I'm sorry you did not enjoy it"
11922,woohooo i bet you are super excited
11923,he should not waste this away
11924,"Oh no! Can you find a different, less expensive dress? Or borrow one from a friend?"
11925,"Ah, well I'm sorry it didn't work out. But, at least you have other options!"
11926,"Friends sometimes have a sixth sense for that sort of thing, don't they?"
11927,"It's a great feeling to have so many people who care about you, I'm sure!"
11928,Congrats. Enjoy it and keep yourself grateful. It's easy to take things for granted sometimes.
11929,The bad times sometimes make us appreciate the good times even more
11930,that's great! Sometimes it's kind of hard to save up money but it's good to have something saved up when things get bad
11931,you should be proud of yourself! good job!
11932,Awesome! I wish I was more productive sometimes. It would really make my life easier
11933,Absolutely. If only if only lol. Maybe I should get a better alarm too so I get up earlier
11934,"Oh, I've been there! I looked like a person who cut when I used to give a lot of cat baths! Did you clean it right away? (cat scratch fever)"
11935,"It isn't too bad, mild cold symptoms usually for a few days, I hope its ok! Do you cut his nails or put nail caps on? Good for bath time."
11936,No I have not? I think it might be fun though. Have you?
11937,What kind of robot is it? What does it do?
11938,Is it a really good job?
11939,Maybe you should tell him that?
11940,What do you mean by that?
11941,"Those people need to find something better to do with their time! Get a hobby, people!"
11942,Oh man! I've been there. That is hard. I hope it wasn't too long!
11943,Don't you hate that when people don't tell you? Well now you know your co-workers can't be trusted! But maybe they were busy and just didn't notice- which is goo!
11944,Aw so sweet! Your very welcome. We've all been there! I completely understand. I don't think anyone saw :)
11945,did they steal anything
11946,sorry you have to live in a not so desirable neighborhood
11947,I have been there! Isn't it nice to feel secure even if for a little bit?
11948,Stocking up is always good. And getting a side business in case
11949,I bet you were really excited.
11950,"Yeah, found money is always the best money."
11951,pretty annoying jeez
11952,if you were on the other end you wouldn
11953,Good work. You must be feeling so healthy and fresh.
11954,"Yes, you will even begin to look years younger as well!"
11955,That's hard. Was it a bad breakup?
11956,"Well, sometimes we lose things if we don't take care of them or just sometimes partners don't appreciate us either."
11957,"Oh my, was the surgery successful?"
11958,"I agree, but always stay positive and hope for the best."
11959,"That's sucks, you should quit if they don't appreciate you."
11960,"I know, finding a new job can be a daunting task, but you should at least keep your options open."
11961,You have a pet duck? That's nuts!
11962,What sort of things do you feed him?
11963,It is hard! Maybe they aren't right then. So many people are just not trustworthy. What have you tried?
11964,Maybe it's time to move? Try church?
11965,"Which one?  Was it good?  I've read a decent amount of those, but I'm always looking for more."
11966,I've never heard of it.  What's it about?
11967,"What size pizza was it? If it was a large, I am not sure how you didn't get sick."
11968,What kind of pizza was it?
11969,"Oh, that's fun to hear. What kind of class is it? Are you teaching, or a student, or what?"
11970,"Oh, very cool. High school? College? I loved certain history classes. Some were hit or miss. And I was never the best at remembering dates. It always depended on how interesting the topic was."
11971,That is a whole lot of nutrition!
11972,"Yea, that sounds good. You should buy some more!"
11973,"Oh no, I take it that you aren't happy about it?"
11974,Sometimes you have to let people make mistakes to really learn from them.
11975,Cool. Everyonr needs a vacation. Where are you going?
11976,The beach is a great place to relax as long as the weather is nice.
11977,Well enjoy yourself!
11978,I bet you are excited
11979,That is always nice when your hard work finally pays off.
11980,Now you should go and celebrate.
11981, HOW SWEET.. HAVE A GREAT TRIP 
11982,"I KNOW .. IT WOULD BE IN TRIGUING .. BY THE WAY , IS IT YOUR FIRST EVER TIRP "
11983,"Hunting, fishing and computers."
11984,"I do read occasionally, do you?"
11985,That sounds really fun. Are you going to go?
11986,Have fun!
11987,Oh? That's pretty interesting! How did it go?
11988,I wish you the best of luck! I bet you did fine
11989,Well they are the one that has to deal with the consequences... mostly i guess.
11990,Oh no! Well they have a lot of great deals online right now.
11991,Yes you should be fine. You can get two day shipping and get lots of cool stuff.
11992,That's true! Maybe check clearances to stock up for next year soon :)
11993,Thats a sad thing to hear
11994,Thats good of you
11995,I am glad! Tell me about it?
11996,Oh is it a country property?
11997,How come? Is something wrong?
11998,"Oh I see, do people bug you for money often?"
11999,I would love that! Give me that feeling :)
12000,No not really. I don't have to rush but I don't wake up too happy usually. I am glad you are having a restful time. Cherish it
12001,I have had to do this too with my best friends (My beloved dogs). It is hard. I know how you feel because I have been there more times then I want to remember. 
12002,Minute by minute and I remind myself that my best friend is no longer in pain.
12003,"Well, it is almost the fact of life that irresponsible people will not last much and regret will be only consequence for them"
12004,"I think over time, they will realize how wasteful and meaningless their behavior is and would start to change for better"
12005,I feel the same way! Prices have already risen on a lot including for people selling things in certain states.
12006,I hope they do. I don't know how he hasn't been impeached yet.
12007,Oh yeah? It's always a bit suspicious when someone just changes their attitude like that.
12008,"They didn't even apologize? Wow, that's rude. Well, hopefully their friendlier mood will last a while."
12009,"Oh no, Did you end up lading safley."
12010,Did the snake try to strike at you?
12011,I'm glad you didn't get bit!
12012,Wow. What kind was it?
12013,Are there a lot of snakes where you live?
12014,My first time was scary too!
12015,Was it a long flight?
12016,"I bet! My sister is happy about that too, she has 4 daughters."
12017,That sounds hectic! 
12018,That sounds really interesting! How do you like it so far?
12019,That would be hard! Do you now Spanish well?
12020,The other day someone flipped out on me all of a sudden.
12021,Nothing good. I am not talking to them again. Maybe ever. Too much of it. It's not really any fun to deal with someone who has so much baggage and childhood issues.
12022,Did you get a good look at the guy?
12023,that sucks.  Did they place you were at have cameras?
12024,"I'm sorry, I'm sure you find one soon."
12025,Just stay persistent and it will happen.
12026,She's lucky to have such a great kid.
12027,"Exactly, we have to return the favor since they put up with us when we were little."
12028,"Oh my goodness, me either!"
12029,Are you going to a Univeristy?
12030,What are you studying to be?
12031,That's interesting. A lot of cool things to learn for sure.
12032,I bet it did!
12033,That is understandable. I have to catch myself sometimes when my kids are in the car.
12034,If people were just more considerate of the other people around them...
12035,That is so true.
12036,Congrats! How is it going?
12037,That seems very trivial but do you mean that he still doesn't seem to know you?
12038,"Have you tried counseling, reading going through a program? Are there good things? I know it is hard when a partner doesn't work on a relationship and keep it good"
12039,For sure but no relationship is perfect and everything takes work
12040,Cool. Are you saving for something specific?
12041,"I have tried saving like that, but I always end up spending it. That's bad"
12042,What play are you doing?
12043,You can watch that play anywhere to help you practice.
12044,How many days are you looking for the extension?
12045,You should talk to her at least.
12046,Did she surprise you with it?
12047,That's so sweet!
12048,wow i wish i could get my kids to do that. congrats
12049,well it seems like he is starting out to become a productive person in life
12050,Is that something they can do?
12051,Can they move in and then not actually buy the house?
12052,"Thats a good outlook to have! What year are you on 1st, 2nd? "
12053,"Never give up, you never lose if you never give up. you got this "
12054,That's a little strange
12055,Used or new?
12056,I can. Its good she achieved her dream.
12057,Did you already make plans?
12058,So what are you going to do? Reschedule?
12059,What were your plans?
12060,Weel you're not missing a concert you can go fishing another day.
12061,That is great.  You must be an excellent parent!
12062,He must be a good student too!
12063,sorry to hear that.. what happened ? 
12064,do you plan to look at getting another dog in the future?
12065,Did you have a hard time in the class itself?
12066,"There's a lot of people who do not so well on tests, do you get another chance?"
12067,what medical test and why do you think the result couldn't be good?
12068,"Oh, sorry to hear that. Hope you'll get well soon."
12069,did you take lots of pictures?
12070,i can understand your pain.. feel the same way
12071,Congratulations! I wish I could get a raise.
12072,That's so true. I would take anything right about now.
12073,S it because they are getting bigger?
12074,I feel you. My 13 year old is the worst.
12075,did you get more or less ?
12076,oh wow.. thats horrible.. our butcher gives you a sample before slicing.. i find this the best way to verify 
12077,"Wow, that's great! You did a great thing by taking in a scared animal!"
12078,It's bringing a smile to my face just thinking about it!
12079,"That's great! Make sure to always stay with her, cruise ships are HUGE"
12080,"lol, yes stay safe and wow what an experience! I am scared of the ocean but I know how amazing it would be though!"
12081,I'm really sorry to hear that :( What happened? I'm here for you if you wanna talk
12082,Have you tried seeing a specialist? Or if you are religious to talk to the pastor? 
12083,"Wow, you should be an avid shooter!!"
12084,ah respect for the armed forces!!. Good luck with your new gun!! Hope you have a blast
12085,"no way!!! I hope you left the house!! I would, and probably would never come back"
12086,oh wow! I would probably kill that friend lol that's a mean prank
12087,"Oh my goodness, that's terrible."
12088,does she have valid reasons ?
12089,you should probably ask to go to couples counseling.. it works if you all are both trying to save your marriage
12090,Wow!  I hate when things like that happen.  I had a similar thing where they would have to replace the whole front body for a small scratch.
12091,"Yeah, just keep an eye out for rust building up, but usually it isn't an issue."
12092,I sorry the hear that.
12093,You should seek revenge.
12094,what have you tried doing to meet new people?
12095,sounds like a good mix of different crowds
12096,"Everyone blooms on their own time, you'll get there, I promise."
12097,How old is she? I havent experienced that yet with my daughter
12098,Have you talked to her about it yet?
12099,I was thinking that. I would need a day or two.
12100,Does she live on her own?
12101,That's great! Most of us like our independence. 
12102,"Oh no, How did happen? "
12103,"Yeah, I understand your concern. "
12104,how so ? moneywise ?
12105,i hear that 
12106,That sounds like fun but I would be scared. I heard they are friendly tho. First time taking care of it? 
12107,Im more scared about them biting me.. maybe one day ill be as brave as you. 
12108,Eww. That is disgusting
12109,"How did they ""put"" it there? nevermind. Its just too much"
12110,You should still get one.
12111,You need to write them down!
12112,Do you not have anywhere to hide your passwords?
12113,Congradulations 
12114,Is this is first time? 
12115,That must be a relief.
12116,Maybe next time you should take a taxi.
12117,by whom?
12118,i can see that.. your vision is clouded sometimes.
12119,I understand that feeling! Was it late?
12120,Oh man! You do not have a car?
12121,"I know. So many bills, so little funds."
12122,Oh. that has to be really stressful.
12123,Maybe you should do something legally to protect them from themselves
12124,I don't know what to tell you then. I've seen it before but not with me personally
12125,"Oh lol! I know, that is why I only watch stuff on the computer. More control over it"
12126,Oh yes they have some cool kids channels.
12127,What was the reason?
12128,Maybe you should try to speak with him again after things calm down.
12129,Pretty good! how old is your son?
12130,"Yeah, you got the best son in the world!"
12131,That's great!  How did you go about it?
12132,"Trying on clothes is the worst.  I went through a weight loss recently, and it's definitely worth it in the end.  Keep vigilant to keep it off!"
12133,Are you talking about ones that just raise and raise prices?
12134,And they always get nasty with you like it was your fault and not theirs! I feel you.
12135,Awesome! What kind of car is it and what color?
12136,"Oh, well if you can get it soon you might want to start researching :)"
12137,What movie were you planning on seeing?
12138,"I understand that completely, well I hope you are able to go another day that you'd like"
12139,I don't think we are ready at any age to lose someone we love. I am so sorry about your Grandmother.
12140,Take it one day at a time. Remember grief does not have a timetable. 
12141,"Oh man! I would have been so made, did you say anything to them?"
12142,Some people on think about themselves! I would have said something if he didn't look the fighting type. 
12143,Oh wow.... a grown woman wetting the bed? Does she do it on purpose?
12144,"That is weird. I'm sorry, but she'd be out of my house! haha!"
12145,That was sweet of him!  Were you shocked because that's something that never happens?
12146,I guess you need to go out more often so he can keep surprising you.
12147,I know how you feel. That's everyone' family.
12148,Me too.  There are only a couple of people I don't really like and I never have to see them because they live far away.
12149,"That is great, did you study a lot for it?"
12150,"Well then great job, you earned it!"
12151,"It's really easy if you think of it as a relative you don't really want to talk to, polite and to the point"
12152,It makes sure that you don't say anything inappropriate but you still feel semi comfortable! 
12153,"Oh No, how long were you out of work for? "
12154,I am sure it was super stressful but I am so happy for you now and yes pop the bubbly! 
12155,That sucks. I bet you felt bad. I am sure she forgave you though.
12156,That's good. We all make mistakes sometimes.
12157,how often do you visit them?
12158,"That is really nice of them seems you have a lovely family, when was the last time you saw them?"
12159,They announce a direct?
12160,Are you a fan of super smash bros?
12161,Do you like shakes? Where are they from?
12162,"That is a good question, I would be scared"
12163,Oh yeah what game system do you play that on? 
12164,"Ive never even heard of that so I guess I am getting old, google will be my friend later. "
12165,"That would make me mad, do you have carpet or hardwood?"
12166,"Oh, well that is a good start then!"
12167,"That is great, did you offer them the job?"
12168,"Great, I hope they are not just a good interviewer, but a good worker as well!"
12169,Oh wow Red and Blue were the best gameboy games
12170,"Never got a chance to play that one, was it better?"
12171,"Sorry, I have not played it myself. "
12172,"Yes, they do. I do love Mario Kart! I would expect the same excellence from all their games. I hope you have other games that you really enjoy."
12173,You are going to nail it I bet. When is it? 
12174,Read up about it on glassdoor thats a good one online! good luck :) 
12175,What did you say to that?
12176,"Wow, congrats then, glad it worked out!"
12177,It's failed before. Just make sure you keep your hands on the wheel.... just in case.
12178,That's cool. Have you driven it yet?
12179,What!  That seems really fast!  Did you train alot?  That is amazing!
12180,You must feel really good about yourself!  I would be if I could do that.
12181,"Yeah, same thing.  They've done so much for me that I just feel bad doing things against them."
12182,"That's family though.  Unless they're straight up abusive, it's just something you have to deal with from time to time."
12183,Thats awesome i bet she will too! when does she start? 
12184,woo hoo so you guys going out to celebrate? 
12185,Are you gonna go home for the holidays?
12186,"Ah that makes sense, I love snow myself, but to each their own!"
12187,Really? I guess there a lot of people that think that as well. Do you still think that?
12188,"Yes, I have an iPhone now and like it pretty good too. I always had Androids before, but I do like Iphone a bit better too!"
12189,"Yes, It's very classic game. "
12190,Good! have a great game ahead!
12191,"I am sorry to hear that, I wish you luck!"
12192,Is it fully paid?
12193,"well congrats, enjoy yourself!"
12194,How old are you?
12195,Do you have a job?
12196,I am also not sure about it
12197,Why do you love this
12198,"I agree, most jobs are painful but necessary."
12199,I am confident that you will.
12200,Why does that no longer happen?
12201,You never too old to play catch!
12202,Who did you say that to?
12203,"Oh, better apologize quickly there!"
12204,"Same.. for me its because i work so much, and being a parent is so draining for me... i bought a new machine tho im going to start working out on friday. Try to find out whats causing it for you, and take 1 step to fix it you got this! "
12205,One tiny baby step in the right direction and everything else will fall together piece by piece!!! 
12206,"Well, that's great! What a wonderful surprise too! I bet you really appreciated it."
12207,It's nice that your parents were able to do that for you. I would have loved it too!
12208,That is a jerk move.   What movie was it.
12209,That sucks. Sorry your brother is a jerl.
12210,"Yikes, how did that happen?"
12211,"That will do it, was everyone okay?"
12212,Did you study a lot for it?
12213,"Well I hope not, I am sure you passed!"
12214,"I like it too, what is your favorite game?"
12215,I like those games too!
12216,"I was a kid then, but I remember my teachers reaction"
12217,"I can imagine, that was a pretty big deal!"
12218,What happened in the past to make you so hesitant?
12219,"I see, well keep opening yourself up and learn to let people in"
12220,"Oh, that sounds lonely :("
12221,How about joining a club?
12222,did you go alone or with a group?
12223,it sounds like its scary
12224,"Oh how exciting, by yourself or with a group?"
12225,"Thats awesome, I have always wanted to do an experience by myself"
12226,"Awesome, sounds like he's ahead of f the curve. You must be proud."
12227,Congradulations.
12228,"Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry."
12229,I hope you feel better.

12234,Well at 16 you have experienced alot of life and are ready to move on

12236,Did you end up getting in?
12237,"That sucks, but that one was worth it I am sure!"
12238,Oh no I am sorry for your loss
12239,"You are welcome, keep your head up"
12240,What is the job you were trying to get?
12241,"Oh, well mauybe next time!"

12243,"You are probably like me, already figure you lost before you scratch the ticket lol. I'm glad you won!"
12244,"That's is a really good thing, it helps build trust in a relationship."
12245,"Well, that is the way the world works now days. Nothing like it did in the past."
12246,"Oh, tell me more!"
12247,Oh I love Pikachu!
12248,Have you considered tring to work out?
12249,That's unforunate.
12250,"that is bad, are there other options?"

12258,"No need to be jealous, I am sure you are much better than him in certain areas."
12259,I am sure you are much happier at home than he is...lol.
12260,"I don't blame you. I am always nervous at interviews. Don't worry, I'm sure you will do great!"
12261,"You will be fine, just don't make yourself too nervous!"
12262,Did you help them out?

12267,im sure it will!
12268,That's a bit rude if you ask me.
12269,I can see why. Some people just don't know when to keep things to themselves.
12270,That stinks. When did you get out?
12271,"Well, at least you got out"
12272,What did she want?

12278,"that is awesome, what is she doing now?"
12279,"well, good for her, that is an accomplishment for sure!"
12280,Good luck! I hope it goes well for you :)
12281,How much is the house?
12282,Awesome! Any idea what you're going to do with the money?
12283,That's a really good idea. Better than blowing it on something now.
12284,"OH no, is she okay?"
12285,Oh great! Does she still ride?
12286,"thats nice of you, what does she like?"
12287,lucky you!
12288,Oh man. I'm sorry. Do you still have a cordial relationship with your ex?
12289,Have you talked to your friend?
12290,That's no fun. Why not?
12291,Well you can always try to make it better. Maybe you should try to get out more?
12292,"thats awesome, i bet they are thrilled"
12293,that is really cool
12294,Oh no! That sounds so irritating. Have you tried talking to your boss about him?
12295,"That's understandable. He sounds clueless. I've had many coworkers like that, and the best way I've found to deal with them is run away as much as possible."
12296,"Wow, I'd be really nervous too. But I know you can do it!"
12297,"Well is it after your lunch break? Maybe we can go out and have lunch, and I'll do my best to get you pumped up for it!"
12298,"Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that."
12299,"Yeah, don't worry too much about it. There are plenty of others out there."
12300,That sounds like such a thoughtful surprise! Did you enjoy it?
12301,How come? Isn't the surprise half the fun?
12302,That is terrible! Did you get it off?
12303,"Man, i would get new shoes!"
12304,That sucks.  Neither did I.   I know how you feel.
12305,I ended up getting an internship then started working at the place... never finished the degree.
12306,"That sounds terrible, i would have cried!"
12307,I understand stand that for sure.
12308,"That's great, what kind of dog is it?"
12309,"Oh wow I only have small dogs, I can't imagine training a big dog."
12310,Is the boss aware or does he seem to skate by unnoticed? 
12311,Is there an HR department you can take it to?
12312,Sounds like it might be time to sit down with the boss and discuss your thoughts and feelings. If moral gets too low it's not good for anybody.
12313,I hope it goes well! are you prepared?
12314,I think you'll do great!
12315,It's a good way to yo keep you two together.
12316,Has he passed?
12317,I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be stressful. Everything will get better.
12318,Look into hotel. I feel into a hotel job after I lost my job years ago and not manage one. It's a great job. Just don't down on your self. 
12319,I hope everything is okay.
12320,That is a good attitude.
12321,I would have slapped him so fast.
12322,I would have just as mad as you are!
12323,"Wow, How lucky! I love to travel."
12324,"Wow, It must be a great job. I have a friend that works for a travel agency in Boston in a similar situation. She said since she started she has been to 32 different countries. "
12325,"Oh no, your a/c isn't working?! This is a bad time of year for that!"
12326,"Man that's awful, I'm sorry. I hope you're able to get it fixed, and soon!"
12327,Aww man.. I am sorry.  Is she at least a good person?
12328,Karma will get here someday.
12329,"That is amazing, care to share?"
12330,"I wish, one day that I could get a check in the mail."
12331,Oh no! Do you have any alternatives?
12332,"Oh I'm so sorry :( I hope you can find something suitable, even if you make it yourself"
12333,"Wow, thats so sad. Has he been on the list long?"
12334,I'm sorry to hear your going through so much stress. My grandmother was on the heart Transplant list for about a month before getting a new heart. Maybe it will be that fast for him.
12335,"Thanks, she got the heart and is doing better. Wow, he is to young for this stress. Good Luck to him and you."
12336,I'm sorry to hear that.  Maybe next time?
12337,I hope you feel better about it.
12338,That is terrible. What did you do about it?
12339,Did you talk to her?
12340,I'm sure. But it's a fresh start. Your the new person you can make people think any thing about you that you want.
12341,Just be your self then. Who cares what they think.
12342,"Oh no, is there something wrong with your dog?"
12343,"I know words don't really help in this situation, but I'm so sorry. I've lost many pets and it rips your heart out. I'm sure you're dog had a great life with you if it's any consolation."
12344,Oh no! Were you prepared?
12345,I bet you will make it up next time.
12346,What about it?
12347,That is very nice memories.
12348,Do you want to yell at him and call him a liar?
12349,One time i secretly called my boss's wife and outted him for an affair he was having with one of my coworkers.. lol he never knew..
12350,that stinks i'm sorry
12351,at least you didn't damage your bike
12352,Gross!  What did you have to do?
12353,Disgusting!  I am sorry you had to experience that!
12354,Im sorry they did that.  That wasn't very cool.
12355,"Surely, it was just your imagination."
12356,I can definitely see why all those things would scare you and make you think you saw a ghost.
12357,That is great!  It is always nice when hard work is rewarded.
12358,Well congratulations!  That is a good way to start the work week.
12359,"Oh goodness, I hope you are okay."
12360,I really understand your concern.
12361,"That sucks.  I think that happens to everyone, accept the one girl who became a doctor."
12362,Try not to let it get to you.  Life is weird.
12363,I didn't understand.
12364,That is a great achievement. You have been doing jousting for how long?
12365,"Oh no, that's messed up!"
12366,Hopefully your insurance will help out.
12367,Eww that's so gross.
12368,"I bet, I wish some people had better manners."
12369,That's scary. I wonder if they made it.
12370,Maybe you will see something in the news in the next day or so.
12371,"Wow, you must be depressed. Life is short."
12372,How is that so?
12373,Heh that's so cute!
12374,LOL! What did you do?
12375,That's terrible! Can you do anything about it?
12376,"Wow, it sounds like you have a lot to be grateful for."
12377,I am so happy for you.
12378,Yay!  What type of dog?
12379,I love a nice squishy face.  I have a Japanese Chin and 3 MinPin
12380,yeah a lot like pekinese.. now you know why I have a 10 bedroom house!
12381,Has it been on the market long?
12382,I would be stressed each time it rains. I rented a place down state and Hurricane Sandy flooded our house. I can't imagine owning a place in a flood zone. 
12383,"Oh I'm so sorry, I'm here if you want to talk"
12384,Aw that's terrible :(
12385,"That's good, you sound very prepared and I'm sure it'll be alright."
12386,"Oh no, that sounds scary."
12387,Thank goodness it wasn't something serious.
12388,That can be embarrassing.  Are you ok?
12389,Sounds painful.  I hope you didn't cause any damage.
12390,"That is good, you must be very religious."
12391,That is very nice of you to help those that are needy.
12392,Watch out State Farm!  lol.  Congratulations!
12393,That is awesome.  She can drive for you now!
12394,Oh yeah.  I just quit smoking myself.  You should try something to distract you.
12395,Nice!!  I'm trying to stay away from any form of smoking for now.
12396,They can not curt you. They are tiny and powerless. 
12397,don't eat them then.
12398,"He was certainly very intelligent, you can definitely increase your own knowledge though if you work at it."
12399,Try reading some books or maybe practicing math problems I guess.
12400,That isn't good. What did you do when you stepped in the poop?
12401,Did you throw the sandals away or just clean them?
12402,"I guess you were pretty hungry then, huh? Well, I'm sure your friend doesn't mind sharing!"
12403,"Well, all you could do was apologize and offer to buy another one. He'll get over it, I'm sure!"
12404,That's nice. Have you always done that?
12405,I've never been a person of faith. My parents weren't either.
12406,"I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you?"
12407,"Aw, I'm glad you have something like that to remember him by. That's a great connection to him to have."
12408,Oh my! I really hope that you find your stuff. Do the cops have any leads?
12409,Well I really hope that your insurance was able to cover what you lost. 
12410,That is great. It is always good to have some recognition for the good job done.
12411,Why would you ever move away from the Caribbean.
12412,Where did you move to after the hurricane?
12413,"Sounds great, i've never been but would love to."
12414,How many times you've been?
12415,That's awesome!  How much did you win?
12416,$100 bucks still sounds great to me!
12417,Addiction is a scary thing! I wish him the best.
12418,Yes it takes a lot of courage to do that.
12419,"That's nice of her, it's good you have such a caring mother."
12420,Yes I'm very grateful for my mother for taking very good care of me.
12421,She takes care of me the best she can.
12422,Your friend takes care of me the best he can.
12423,Awesome. I was in Sturgis in 2004. Did you ride out or trailer your bike?
12424,"Lucky, be careful some people can get carried away out their. "
12425,where is it shipping from? is it a reputable store?
12426,yeah. hopefully you will have better luck with it.
12427,Oh no! That sounds awful! What a kind thing to do though! Im sure they were very grateful for your help!
12428,"I hope you took the right precautions not to get it yourself! I can only imagine that, I have never had it and never want to!"
12429,Is it an engineering job or something else.
12430,That is great. Would you be an astronaut then?
12431,That is very nice of you to try to help the turtles.
12432,That is very odd. Hopefully they won't get killed anymore.
12433,No I haven't 
12434,I hate it when my team loses too. All that time invested for a loss is disappointing. 
12435,Do you like your job or is this something you dread?
12436,Well I hope you find something you love and you're happy to do. Still searching for that myself.
12437,Which supplies did you get?
12438,Oh that sounds like fun!
12439,Where to? What location?
12440,"Wow, you will be fine. Years ago I went to Japan to teach English and also got called to duty and spent time in Iraq and a few other places. Once you arrive it's never as bad as you will have it built in your head."
12441,"I hate the summer honestly, the winter is great for me."
12442,I love the cold. it keeps me cool when i sleep.
12443,"Oh great. That is so fun . My baby died a few years ago. But he was over 14 , so. "
12444,Thanks. At least he lived a pretty good long time . He was a beagle mix named Jack.
12445,"I'm sorry.. my first gut reaction was to laugh a little. I really don't mean to make fun of you. That's terrible! Was it because you didn't want to miss a part of the movie, so you tried to hold it in as long as possible?"
12446,"The movie did? It sounds like maybe at least it was a good movie, if that's any consolation. I hope no one made fun of you. It's a common human mistake."
12447,I have never been to an airport honestly.
12448,I like to stay home where I know i'm a little saffer.
12449,Maybe tell him how you feel about that.
12450,"Punch him right in the nose, that will fix things i'm sure!"
12451,That's too bad. Are you going to replace it?
12452,Maybe you will be able to replace it soon. What happened to it?
12453,That's a way to make a buck! Ebay?
12454,You are my hero.
12455,I see that more in the country I guess. That would be horrifying. But maybe he is just immune to pain?
12456,Sounds like he was ok. I've had injuries before and they weren't serious enough or worth the hassle of the emergency room. But he still had to take a trip to go somewhere. Don't be afraid to care though :) One person is all that is needed- Kindness is always good!
12457,Neurofeedback? I don't even know what that is! Could you fill me in a little bit? And why did you need to learn about it?
12458,"That is really interesting. Still over my head, but you did a decent job of explaining it in layman's terms. I appreciate it. So are you a med student, or what?"
12459,Holy cow... That is really awesome. That's nice of you to dedicate your free time like that. I sincerely hope everything works out. I appreciate you sharing that.
12460,oh i love looking at old photos
12461,my nieces and nephews are all growing up on me and my step kids are almost adults too. it goes by in a blink of an eye
12462,Oh wow!! I love pyrex stuff. I bet it brought back many memories. 
12463,Its funny how items can bring back such good memories. 
12464,I hope they weren't expensive shoes.
12465,That's a shame. Does your dog chew on shoes often?
12466,I hear you. I'm not ready to go back either. 
12467,I'm sure it will be ok. A new year is a new time to reinvent yourself. 
12468,I live in a small town with no car.
12469,I want to get a car one day i think.
12470,I would just go to the beach right now!
12471,"Not mine at all, i enjoy my house."
12472, I bet that was a nice surprise. Why did you get it?
12473,You are lucky then. Always good to receive things you arent expecting. 
12474,"I'm in college, so i'll be your friend."
12475, I wish I could be with you and not in school
12476,Did you just recently find out?
12477,"Does it upset you? Just think, the family that raised you, actually pursued you and love you."
12478,Where that happened?
12479,What did you call to get towed?
12480,Maybe you should go by yourself. Normally wifes stay at home and clean.
12481,Maybe if you go somewhere else without the girl.
12482,Oh my gosh I hope you were ok!
12483,I'm really sure you will figure it out. 
12484,Maybe pray and she will hear you.
12485,Maybe she could if you tried.
12486,Adulting is hard that's for sure. Start playing it and streaming and make some money.
12487,I just read that youth was wasted on the young. lol Kind of apropos.
12488,It's funny how you learn things as you get older even if you aren't doing major things. Little things you can learn a lot from
12489,"Sorry to hear that. You sound like a hard worker, which is something to be proud of, even though it's kind of wearing you out maybe. Are you able to roll the days over to next year and save them, at least?"
12490,"That's kind of a lame policy. I hope you get to use them at some point, because they should be worth something. If you're just physically unable to because of the job and its demands, and then they end up passing you by, that doesn't seem fair. I hope you get to relax during the holidays, then."
12491,I think I'm too young for that but man wouldn't that be nice today?
12492,"I'm sure they were, I can barely afford to survive."
12493,Lol. Did you dare look inside?
12494,"That is bad.  I  always try to remember how long stuff has been in there, but sometimes things hide on you in there."
12495,Weird.. that happened to me last year.  In Baltimore..
12496,That is horrible.. I am sorry!  Mine got closed after a scandal that was on Netflix
12497,Same here and its hard when your school doesn't exist anymore
12498,Yeah that would be awesome!  What are you going to spend it on??
12499,Heck yeah!  That sounds like fun!  
12500,My weekend was pretty okay. Did anything special happen for you?
12501,Wow! Have you always fished as a hobby? I've never been.
12502,ours is a family table too so i understand what you mean. i really need to refinish it
12503,a little. i am hoping my mother in law will be able to help me with it. she's done it before successfully.
12504,it's worth it to keep a family herloom
12505,"Oh no, do you know why it could've happened?"
12506,So it could be something wrong with the soil? I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
12507,oh no. did you know the spirit you contacted?
12508,i would totally freak out
12509,I am so sorry... What happened?
12510,Is he ok now?
12511,"Remember safety is the first priority of amusement parks, everything will be just fine!"
12512,Hey that sounds exciting!!  Are you ready?
12513,Yeah I would be pumped too!  Is it coming with a raise as well?
12514,Oh man!!  Make sure to put some back for retirement or emergency fund!!
12515,"Do you feel negative about it, or positive? It's hard to tell from your sentence. Maybe you feel both ways. If I were in your shoes, I could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation. I was always the youngest child, so I never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time. If you're not happy about it, hopefully you can turn it into a positive so that your sister doesn't get any undue negativity."
12516,"I can understand why you'd start to feel that way. I think it's good that you want to look inward instead of just blatantly blaming other people. That means you can start to look for ways to make you feel better about yourself, that are solutions! But nothing has to be ""wrong with you."" For some, it just takes time. For others, they find it easier to accept someone to settle down with."
12517,"That seems like a short train ride compared to say, going across country or something! Are you going to be sleeping on it overnight?"
12518,"They really do feel that way! There's actually a train in Africa, I want to say Kenya? Where it is like stepping back in time and you go on a week long journey on the train, you have to dress fancy and it seems like a dream come true."
12519,That's awesome!  I bet you're a proud parent! 
12520,Is he getting any gifts because he's done so goo?!
12521,That sounds like a lot of fun!
12522,That is cool!  I bet you all had a really great time
12523,Was it enjoyable?
12524,What did you do on the train?
12525,Did you clean the house yourself or hire someone to do it?
12526,How long did it take you to clean your house?
12527,That sounds nice. How come you didn’t go with?
12528,I am with you there.  I hope you get a chance to go there sometime though. 
12529,"I'm sorry, why can't you go out?"
12530,Oh that's not fun.
12531,Did you ask the kid or the kid's parents to stop kicking your chair?
12532,How long was the flight you were on?
12533,Holy cow that's awesome!  Are we taking the kids??
12534,oh haha!  Is this your first time?
12535,"Myself as well friend, i love vacation."
12536,"I do not like the beach, too much sand."
12537,That sounds fun to go to.
12538,I love going to the movies and getting food!
12539,"Oh, why did you cheat on her?"
12540,"It's a man's world, isn't it."
12541,Hey that's good.  What was wrong with it?
12542,That's pretty awesome.  I don't guess it cost too much then.
12543,How fun. How big was your catch?
12544,thats a big one. I bet it was scary. Did you eat it?
12545,"Oh my goodness, I bet that was embarrassing!!! "
12546,Well it happens to everyone i wouldnt let it keep bothering you. Just laugh it off!
12547,That is terrible.  Did you get hurt badly?
12548,Were there a lot of people around?
12549,Must be nice!  Do you think he will let you ride it?
12550,"I would be too, those things are really nice. "
12551,"Oh, that sounds like a hassle."
12552,"Oh that's not cool, get a different one."
12553,Uh oh!!  I hope it wasn't a prank lol
12554,I bet.  I would be too!  Was the food good??
12555,Florida is so nice. Are you going for work or pleasure?
12556,"Thats a lot of miles, but they make cars good these days. "
12557,Oh no!  Happens to the best of us.  Are you feeling better now?
12558,"Oh no!  I would hope that people had compassion for your situation and if they didn't, well shame on them.  I once peed my pants at a wedding I was laughing so hard. "
12559,Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents!
12560,"Oh wow, that's a big snake!"
12561,"Oh wow, what was the award for?"
12562,Oh congratulations! You are a true hero
12563,That is so sweet.  How did he lose his leg?
12564,I've heard that it doesn't bother them to lose one limb.  I watch Dr. Jeff on Animal Planet a lot and that is what he says.
12565,I'm so sorry.  I have dealt with a lot of sleep problems and night panic attacks so I know how hard it can be dealing with things like that. I have a friend who does the same thing. Don't be humiliated.  You can't control it.
12566,I hate those things!  They are so restrictive.  I wish I could remember the name of the medication that my friend is on that helped her...let me check with her and see if she texts me back.
12567,"Don't feel any shame.  The medication is called Topomax.  It supposedly stops the receptors in the brain that trigger night sleep eating.  I also know that if you happen to take Ambien,a sleeping pill, go off of it because it actually can cause night sleep eating. Take care!"
12568,Ugh! They do that here too! Are you in a bad city too?
12569,Did you find out who did it?
12570,"Oh really, I was unaware of that."
12571,That is quite interesting.
12572,That's great. You have to buy a new one every so often as the motors get weak in them.
12573,I love the way carpet feels after you use a brand new vacuum on it. Almost like it's new again.
12574,That sounds really dramatic! What's the matter? What's making you so unsure about it?
12575,"I can understand trying to abide by one's intuition... Are you going on your flight to somewhere where you have something important to do or someone to meet? Perhaps it may be unfair to them or that situation if you don't go through with it. If you want to do it, try your best to think of all the repercussions, and to weigh the pros and cons, and to not let your intuition cloud your judgment."
12576,I think it's an adjustment you have to work through. Toddlers can really test anyone's patience!
12577,"It's really hard, especially being thrown into an environment with a two year old and not having them for a consistent basis from when they were younger up until now."
12578,"Oh! I hear you, I love them but I get sick when I eat them. Did you do okay?"
12579,That's unusual. Are you allergic to something they are fried in or just potatoes in general? I have digestive issues so I get tired too when I eat junk food
12580,That's terrible! Sorry to hear that.
12581,So do I. People need to be more considerate of others.
12582,"Well, sometimes we can feel that way in life. Relieved because there isn't drama, but get a bit lonely. Maybe you can get out and meet some new people?"
12583,"Well, whatever makes you happy, that's what you should do. But, still, never hurts to at least have platonic friends :)"
12584,Congrats to him!  What type of skating?
12585,"Oh, now I understand.  He is skateboarding. "
12586,Oh no. Have you been stressed about anything?
12587,You sound nervous.
12588,I don't blame you. It can be scary...the more people there are- the worse they drive. Be careful!
12589,For sure! And always check for the wreckless drivers and the ones who cut you off- Thats really bad in bigger cities. Can never be too careful.
12590,"Definitely. The world is an extremely complex thing, and I don't know if we'll ever fully understand it."
12591,I would imagine that people who have certain personality types are typically drawn to becoming doctors. They all seem to be very compassionate! 
12592,That's an interesting thing to know! Have you thought about doing it as a hobby?
12593,"If it makes you feel peace of happiness, definitely!"
12594,Oh hey! A fellow bird feeder. Did you eventually get some?
12595,That's good. Sometimes we forget to do things that matter to us.
12596,"That's good, have you been having trouble?"
12597,"I'll say. You can appreciate it that much more. What made the difference, if I may ask?"
12598,"Oh man, the flu in summer?1"
12599,Oh geez! Was it a quick flu
12600,"Wow! Great wife, Cherish her! Stack up on good vitamin C and good Elderberry when you're well to keep the flu away :)\"
12601,Oh god...lol- I HATE being sick...When I get sick..it's BAD- So let's hope lol
12602,That is great you showed the initiative to apply.  It is common to be a bit nervous.
12603,Just think positive thoughts and I am sure you will get the news shortly
12604,That sounds relaxing! How was the weather?
12605,I love when everything just seems to work out together. Im glad you enjoyed!
12606,That is really good.  In this economic climate it is good to have something like that to count on.  What do you do?
12607,That's great.  I am glad you're doing well.
12608,I am so so sorry to hear that. 
12609,I know this is so hard for you but he is in no more pain and I am sure he is watching over you
12610,What was the drawing of?
12611,"You said that already, how long did it take you to draw this picture?"
12612,Thats exciting! where are you going??
12613,Is that a country? i know the name but not the geography.
12614,Oh no!!  That is awful.  I hope you are okay :(
12615,"I bet.  Nothing is worse than losing a friend suddenly like that.   Keep your head up, friend."
12616,Oh that is so cool! You must be a great relative.
12617,That is awful. I would definitely not pay and never go back again.
12618,They will lose a lot of business over that one. Word of mouth is the best way to hurt someone. That is gross and I wouldn't go back either.
12619,That is so wonderful!  I have the same kind of husband.  Aren't we lucky?  It gives me hope for when my daughter grows up and finds someone.
12620,"Oh wow, your daughter is a lot closer than mine whose just 8.  I already worry about it.  I know they'll find some upstanding men but they can take their time in finding them! ha ha."
12621,"Glad you made it, what happened to almost be short?"
12622,That was very nice of your grandma. How much did she cover?
12623,I know. It was so shocking and sad.
12624,That was a great movie!
12625,That is good!  Why have you been feeling down about the future before?
12626,"Staying positive can be very hard, but it helps to be around the right people."
12627,OHHH! Those are nice! How much was it if you don't mind me asking?
12628,"Great! That is how it should work. Not one guy making a ton more, as it takes everyone to make it work :)"
12629,Why are you alone? did you just move?
12630,Was it a significant other? was it the correct decision?
12631,Sorry?
12632,"No problem! I have done it before. Oh wow! That sounds nice, are they still together? I hope."
12633,Understandable. But remember there are always private things. No relationship is perfect. It takes both working hard
12634,Congratulations! That is awesome!  I don't really have much luck in winning things.  Have you won anything else before in your life?
12635,That is so cool. I have been drooling over an iPad!  Is it amazing??
12636,"Oh man, good luck! Make sure to have a book/music on hand at least to help distract you"
12637,I think that would help. Is it for vacation?
12638,I have never seen any of the new Star Wars movies.
12639,I have not been to the movies in a long time. It is very expensive to go these days.
12640,"I'm so sorry, were they impressed?"
12641,I would imagine they were quite delighted.
12642,I totally feel for her. I have lost many the past year. It's hard
12643,That was nice of you. Having company helps through grief.
12644,Has something changed lately?
12645,That is a very good attitude that you have!
12646,What was the exam for?
12647,When will you get the results for this exam?
12648,I hate the dentist. It always makes me nervous. Are you going for a checkup?
12649,Oh no :( That sucks. I hope it's only one
12650,Oh that is fantastic!!!  I bet you're proud of him!
12651,That's pretty cool!  You sound like an awesome grandparent! :D
12652,"That is cool, did you teach him how to fish?"
12653,I am sure he didn't let you hear the end of that.
12654,that sounds like a nice sunday
12655,hopefully it happens again soon!
12656,wow thats a huge pain
12657,i know what you mean
12658,I hope so! I hate driving but good luck.
12659,"Good, that's really important thing."
12660,"That's great! Congratulations! That's exciting, and I'm sure if you're confident she will, then she will!"
12661,"Oh, okay. Well, that is a bit different, but good luck!"
12662,I'm sorry.  It sounds like you had a tough life.
12663,I could not have said it better myself.
12664,"Oh lord, why did you do that?"
12665,You pay your gramma back and stop drinking. Seriously
12666,How are you ready?
12667,What kinds of snacks do you have for it?
12668,How did he win a lot of money?
12669,Does he play the scratcher tickets a lot?
12670,oh yea something else insane?
12671,that makes no sense.
12672,"O that sounds delicious, any idea what you'll get?"
12673,"Sounds delicious, get some queso too!"
12674,"Sadly, I agree with you.  As I get older, it seems like that more and more.  What happened that made you feel that way?"
12675,Its so true! I battle chronic illness and excruciating pain daily for almost 14 years now not to mention drowning in old medical bills.  I put my faith in God and pray for relief.  Its really hard to stay optimistic.  I really hope life improves for you and you can enjoy and embrace life again.  
12676,That is exactly what I've been going through along with horrible doctors that did nothing for me.  I just went high nutrient vegan 3 months ago and am improving my leaps and bounds.  I follow Dr. Joel Furhman.  You can keep going and your journey is giving you compassion for others that are going through horrible things.  Take heart and I hope you feel better.  
12677,I hear you! It's sad yet happy to think of how great it was years ago! I hope we get to keep our good memories when we leave this world
12678,I know right <3. Such a great time when we weren't the adults as well! lol- Paying bills is no fun.
12679,How were you dancing?
12680,Were they expensive pants?
12681,"Why? Are you scared to ride it? I can relate, so if that's the case, just skip it."
12682,"Oh, I see, so it's kind of a have-to scenario. Well, I always let my hubby do that, but maybe you're the hubby too lol. "
12683,"Sure! If you've never ridden it, then you really should. "
12684,You are very lucky you didn't crash your car while driving.
12685,"Yes, how much did it cost to fix the tire?"
12686,it looks like it's going to be good!
12687,Me too... those are my favorite type of movies
12688,"Oh goodness, what happened?"
12689,"Oh no, you must be devastated.  I'm sorry."
12690,Ohh gosh! What happened. That's so terrifying
12691,"Oh, I feel sorry for you."
12692,"Thats good, do yall live in the same town?"
12693,"my mother lives far away, and I live with my father, but its not ideal"
12694,Oh my god that’s hilarious. 
12695,Oh no I am so sorry about that. Did everything turn out ok?
12696,"Oh, what caused them to move out?  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?"
12697,I see. I'm sorry you're home alone.  I get lonely myself when you're used to someone around.  Are you going to advertise for a new roommate?
12698,Do you have any children already or will this be your first?
12699,Do you know if it is a boy or girl?
12700,"That is irritating, huh.  It is like a kid that can't stand not having the attention for a minute so they act up.  Haha"
12701,It just wants you off the phone instead.  
12702,I hope you didn't drink the soup. They better of given you the meal for free.
12703,"Oh, I thought it was a t a restaurant."
12704,Nah.  Don't worry my friend!  It will be okay!
12705,I don't think they will.  We are the worlds greatest army
12706,What position does your nephew play?
12707,Is your nephew a big kid?
12708,Oh no! What did he do?
12709,"Yes, little brothers can sometimes be irritating.  Maybe ask him next time to turn it down?"
12710,Where did you go? You went alone?
12711,"That is awesome, I've been there when I was a kid and had a lot of fun!"
12712,That is crazy! what was your original major?
12713,How are you faring in todays climate?
12714,"That's not good, what is the contract dispute about?"
12715,"Yeah, that's always rough. I would take them to court if it's in the 4 digit range."
12716,"I haven't been.  I would really love to go, and it's good to hear such a good review from someone."
12717,What else is there to do there other than see the falls?
12718,Good for YOU! Integrity is very rare nowadays
12719,I feel the same way!
12720,Did you cry when you were looking at the photos?
12721,My niece lives in Los Angeles. I do not get to see her very much.
12722,That is wonderful!  How many kids do you have?  That's a tough job but so rewarding!
12723,I have 2 kids.  I love being home with them as well. I am blessed to be able to work at home.  I also homeschool them and love teaching! Are you having any more kids?
12724,That is awesome!  How long were they away 
12725,Great! What kind of job is it?
12726,Sounds great! Better pay is always good!
12727,That is a great surprise.   I bet you are very thankful.
12728,Do you know what you are going to spend it on?
12729,I would not want to be in your position it's ok to help but all the time it can be dreadful. 
12730,It will get better put your foot down and maybe say no in a nice way to not step on any ones toes.
12731,That's awesome! congratulations too!  What do you do?
12732,Oh nice! My brother in law is a lawyer and I remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes.  Sounds like you are a great lawyer.  Hope it goes well for you!
12733,Wow congrats! What type of music do you play?
12734,"Nice, I really like folk music. I hope you guys put off a great show."
12735,Oh what a scene. How did it make you feel?
12736,You are so lucky to have a family like that!
12737,"oh my lord, please say thats not true."
12738,that is one of the most horrible things ive ever heard.
12739,I would be mad! Did she say why she didn't bring you anything?
12740,Maybe you could talk to her after you calm down a bit.  I'm sure there is a reason.
12741,Aw I'm sorry.  Why are you lonely?
12742,Maybe you could invite a friend over for a movie?
12743,Maybe you could facetime your wife.
12744,That sounds really frustrating! Who mows their lawn that early holy cow!
12745,Wow I would be mad to. 
12746,"Gee, that is too bad. I wonder why Becky got it and you didn't?"
12747,"Yeah, that's no fun. Maybe you'll get offered the next promotion that is available? "
12748,What day is that?
12749,Oh lord..that gives me chills just hearing the word. What was it on?
12750,Do you have more than one dog??
12751,"I feel like this is obvious,  but is he white?"
12752,That sounds awesome! I've only ever been to Florida in order to get to Disney World. Are you there to visit family? Business? To sight-see?
12753,"Yeah... I had to do a long drive from Nebraska to Colorado this summer. It was about a 7-hour drive. That was starting to push it. So, I could see 9 hours being a little rough. I just tried to load up on podcasts to listen to."
12754,Oh that's awful!  I hope he is going to be okay.  Did they lay him off with severence or anything?
12755,Yeah.  He will get to spend more time with you all now!  Take the father on a vacation!
12756,I lad you was ok did anyone help you or was you embarrassed? 
12757,Now that was mean and cruel nothing funny about that best outcome is you are fine be careful next time.
12758,Oh boy.  That's no good.  Did the credit card company alert you or did they miss it too?
12759,I bet.  I can't believe they didn't alert you.  Were they able to take care of it for you and suspend the charges and the account?
12760,"Oh goodness, is she okay?"
12761,I really wish the best for y'all.  Good health.
12762,That was nice of him. You should take him out for dinner.
12763,That is impossible thou. It is a dog eat dog world out there.
12764,Congratulations. Do you have any party planned for this event?
12765,That is cool. Are you going alone or with friends?
12766,You shouldn't let those kind of people upset you.
12767,Maybe you should move out? Have you thought about that.
12768,"Oh! Yeah I understand that, maybe they will take you?!"
12769,Oh yes of course! I am sorry.
12770,That's so nice. Is he doing better now?
12771,I'm sure it was a great comfort to you. Food is a great way to tell someone you care. 
12772,"That's great. My mother is like that too, and it's easy take for granted, but not all are so lucky !"
12773,You sure are! At least you appreciate and acknowledge so I'm sure she is pretty glad to have you as her child.
12774,"Yes, all the time! My girlfriend always thinks I'm so weird."
12775,I'm sorry to hear that. We all have our demons. Sometimes it's good to take one day at a time and try to stay positive. 
12776,Good to hear! What is the subject?
12777,That's something to be proud of! Good job!
12778,I'm not sure what that is. Tell me about it?
12779,"Oh, okay, I believe I know what you are talking about now. He is a good actor and usually his movies are great!"
12780,I hope you wasn't to disappointed was you to going to spend time together? 
12781,A simple call would have been nice hopefully he has a good explanation for this. 
12782,Can you really put a price on pizza?
12783,"I understand,  If a pizza is more than 10 dollars, im not paying."
12784,That must be so annoying.
12785,"I'm sorry, maybe one day when he gets older."
12786,Oh no! I hope you didn't have to go anywhere the next day? Did you try anything to help?
12787,"Oh, well that's a bonus! No one needs sleep on christmas lol"
12788,Can't you just live with someone?
12789,"Well, dogs are good for protection."
12790,That stinks. Did you hurt your foot?
12791,"I read that wrong, I thought you said you tripped over a vase and it broke. Will you be in trouble if she finds out?"
12792,"Oh no!  Its always tough in relationships but when you can't go see her or make her talk to you afterwards, I'm sure its extra hard.  Did you call back and tell her that?"
12793,"I'm sure once she calms down, she will look on it as not as big of a deal.  If you have to work, you have to work.  I hope you can work it out!  "
12794,"Hahaha. I'm so sorry, but that made me laugh. I really don't mean to make you feel like I'm thinking you're dumb, because I don't. Everyone makes that mistake. I have an old Honda Civic, and I run into that problem, too. You probably gave the locksmith a good story to tell, and made his day. Hopefully you can smile at it tomorrow."
12795,"Oh man, he didn't charge you? You both kind of won then! A good story for you both at no cost. Well, except for time. It was a good learning lesson. And yeah.. the bumper sticker.. that's crazy. I'm glad you're able to not take yourself so seriously. That makes for a great personality."
12796,"Oh, well, I guess that was a bit disappointing huh. Well, maybe you can go real soon."
12797,"Oh, well, you're going to have to say, ""Mom, I know you're tired but I really want to see this movie, can we please just go? It'll be fun, we need time together""."
12798,I understand.  Tell me about it.
12799,"Yes, one day at a time."
12800,Woo hoo! What were you promoted too?
12801,That's great! What kind of tasks do you do?
12802,"That's an interesting way to get attention. What spurred that on? Was it a dare, or was he just feeling wild?"
12803,Interesting.. Did he get in trouble? Was this at a high school or something? And does he take gymnastics?! Back flips are hard!
12804,Do you guys fight often?? How do they usually turn out?
12805,Are your political views the same? and do you think this next fight will end well?
12806,"I'm really sorry to hear that. What's worse is the best thing for breakups, the only thing that really helps, is time passing by. But the people who are hurting, in the moment, they can't really understand or accept that. So, you feel like you have to help and do something, when in reality it's probably best you don't smother them and that they have space. I hope she feels better, though."
12807,"Yeah, that's a good idea. That's always a solid way to go about it. My roommate had a breakup 6 months ago. I tried not to give any advice that was too specific, because the best solution always has to come from that person themselves. My roommate ended up just focusing on himself as much as possible, diving into artistic endeavors, trying to work out, etc."
12808,That is disappointing. Did you confront them about it? I am sorry you have to deal with that.
12809,"That's too bad. Lesson learned, I guess."
12810,That sounds stressful! How far did you move?
12811,That's quite a ways. Do you have any hobbies that could help you meet new people?
12812,"Well, that's wonderful and I know it really is so great to hear your child's first words!"
12813,"For Sure. Before you know it, he'll be saying full sentences!"
12814,That is always true. The saying goes..water your own grass.
12815,Find some good books and good therapy and make your life what you want it to be. If you truly love your partner then don't lose them over feelings. Feelings are fleeting.
12816,"Yeah, I do. I'm in a long distance relationship. I get that everytime I have to fly back home. I hope you start to feel better, though. Loneliness can end up being a good motivator, however."
12817,"Ah, your situation sounds complicated. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. It sounds like you've given a lot of thought though, and the way you lay it out, you sound very mature about it. You've developed a good perspective on it, one that I should learn to appreciate myself. With your temperament, I'm sure you won't suffer from loneliness very long. People will want to be around you, as long as you want them around you."
12818,"You sound like you've dealt with more hardship than the average person. I wish I could empathize with you, but I've been lucky to avoid that kind of thing recently. But I do hope things will turn out differently for you soon. If anything, these things will make you more resilient than the average person, too. That's not worth nothing."
12819,Do you feel their weight?
12820,Sounds exciting. Will you do it again?
12821,Are they usually a winning team?
12822,"Oh wow,  I hope they do well.  "
12823,"Wow, that must be scary to have to trust someone else with all of your stuff. What took you out of the country?"
12824,A two month vacation sounds amazing! I figured it was for work or something when you said two months. What is your favorite thing to do in the Bahamas?
12825,That is worrisome but also exciting. Is it your first child?
12826,Congratulations. I wish you the best of luck. Parenthood is a blessing.
12827,"That sucks, how old was the goldfish?"
12828,What did you do with Goldie after she died?
12829,Aw.  I bet that is so bittersweet. Do they graduate next May?
12830,That is a good sign!  I know many kids that age who have no direction so it sounds like he's really going places.  Do you have any other kids that will still be at home?
12831,What is the certification exam for?
12832,My father was an architect. So I have heard about these exams.
12833,"I hear you! Life is SO busy, never enough hours in the day!"
12834,"Oh lol! It's ok, you are a mom and it's the hardest job EVER and very thankless. You are doing good"
12835,Yes I do hate being all alone. That's how I feel when my boyfriend leaves town for work.
12836,Yes you have to do what is best for yourself. Take care of you before others.
12837,"Right on, that sounds cool. Did you go with family, or a date? Or maybe just hung out there alone? That's okay, too. I love Italian food, had always wanted to go to Olive Garden, but my dad hates Italian. So when we were growing up, we just never went. Now that I'm on my own, I've been... twice. Both times, they were just okay."
12838,"It can be cheap to go there sometimes for an easy filling meal, with the deals and coupons they have, I think. With the bread and soup you can get. I hope you guys had a good time! "
12839,I'm sorry the hear that.  Maybe another company would appreciate your talent.
12840,The first job out of college is a good way to test the waters but someday you will have to spread those wings.
12841,Just take your time and don't get so nervous you got this. 
12842,Great to have some hands on help parallel parking is very hard but once down packed it is easy.
12843,That's ok.  Employers don't look at your grades I don't think.
12844,"It sounds like you have determination, and that is worth more than a 4.0"
12845,Yeah it should be a good one. Who is your favorite team?
12846,Hope Dak has a good year! I am all about the tailgating.
12847,That must have been somewhat weird.
12848,"Oh goodness, that is so creepy!"
12849,That sounds so exciting get ready for sleepless nights and long nights gambling. 
12850,Know your limit once you start gambling it will make it much easier so you won't go broke.
12851,"I'm sorry, but I don't envy you... I've always just driven a little sedan. I'm an alright driver, but if I had to drive something bigger, I'd be nervous, too. Too easy for me to make mistakes. I kind of dread the day where I'll have to drive a big Uhaul truck. I hope things go well for you, though."
12852,"Well, as long as you're patient and careful, you'll minimize your mistakes. There are those who go out there and think they know everything. Even if they're a good driver, they may be more likely to slip up and have a problem than you would. So, just stay positive!"
12853,Maybe you can observe what she's doing and use that to advance in the industry as well.
12854,I'd be worried about having these kinds of feelings towards your wife.
12855,That does sound creepy. What did you do?
12856,Clowns are scary. Did you make it out safe?
12857,Oh that is pretty cool. Were there any clowns there?
12858,That is good to hear. I like the ones that are funny better.
12859,Did it turn out to be a great event even though the bands was unknown? 
12860,That is good to hear I would enjoy a night with some great music. 
12861,That sounds scary! What was it?
12862,Oh no. Are there other people at home with you?
12863,That was nice of them. What movie do you want to see?
12864,You should see 8th grade. Nice story about a girl growing up. You will like it.
12865,That is very impressive. Do you know what languages they are?
12866,"wow, I bet Chinese is one the State Department really needs right now. I hope your friend gets the job."
12867,Wow. You can wear yoga pants to work? I'd like that dress code!
12868,Ah I'm glad that's over for you then. Now you're less likely to forget doing laundry again.
12869,"Oh no, are you worried about her? Do you think she will be faithful?"
12870,"Yes I agree, guys are a little let reliable sometimes. "
12871,Wow. That is impressive! I can't even do a cartwheel on a mat.
12872,Maybe she is part kangaroo afterall.
12873,That
12874,AH-HEM! What I meant to say prior to my keyboard malfunction was...that sounds really neat! Where are you going to go camping?
12875,People really need to be more respectful. What did you do?
12876,"He deserved it, that scumbag."
12877,That is scary. I hope she wasn't too shaken up from it.
12878,That is very true. Well I am glad she is OK. Thanks for sharing about it.
12879,It must be nerve wrecking especially since it has so much impack on your job.
12880,Try to stay calm and do your best. Good luck!
12881,That sounds exciting! When are you going?
12882,"It's good to focus, but surely you can take a few hours to take in the culture.  China has a long and interesting history."
12883,i hate that!
12884,hahaha...aww..cant give away the pupper
12885,That's too bad. What's Your favorite dish?

12894,"I feel you.. When my pet dunken passed away, i got a new dog, named him dunken and restarted our relationship from there"
12895,"That's awesome! And crazy... And scary... and awesome all at once! You must kinda feel accomplished though, huh? Good to hear that everyone is happy and healthy. Kind of weird how you all will have that special, unique bond for the rest of your lives, now. "
12896,"It's funny, you guys walked into work that day and thought it'd be another usual, boring day. You clocked out maybe with some blood on your shirt, smelling like newborn. Awesome."
12897,Wow. I definitely would take it up wiht your credit card.
12898,They really should be more considerate. allergies are a serious medical concern.
12899,What happened? Did you ask her to go out on a date?
12900,"Yeah, that happens all the time with me. Well, actually, it doesn't, since I can't text because I wear Hulk Hands all the time. I just smash things."
12901,Wow. Why did he do that?
12902,"If he wasn't happy with the food, there arebetter ways to tell you."
12903,Not sure what an emu is. I hope you find him/her!
12904,Maybe she just wanted to go play. I hope she comes back.
12905,That really sucks. That would have been an instance to cry over SPILLED milk indeed!
12906,Never thought about that. Thank god you recovered it!
12907,that is awesom!!!
12908,hahaah...thats too cute

12921,"That's really bad, but really good that your faced didn't turn out scarred for life. "

12933,That's great! Good for him!
12934,That will be exciting!
12935,lol.  Maybe you should talk to them about it!
12936,Yeah I understand.  Maybe you should pay them back by interrrupting them?
12937,That's too bad. Do you have a new job lined up?
12938,"I hope you find one soon. If you don't, you are more than welcome to come work in my sweatshop in Siberia."
12939,Oh that must be such a relief.
12940,Did the little guy even feel guilty for running away?
12941,You cannot enjoy bowling all alone. It is a group game. Don't you have any friends to invite?
12942,What happened? Is it something because of you or him?
12943,"I have a Chase credit card. They really aren't that great, but I do hope you get approved. Why do you need it?"

12953,That's really swell! What lake did you go to?
12954,I am happy that you had a great weekend. I should really check it out myself sometime.
12955,Wow. It can be difficult to put together but finding the parts is a lot of fun.
12956,I think if you show that you put in some effort yourself first she won't mind.
12957,Wow. You were either very imaginative or upset.
12958,"Thought that reminded me of Death Note, but I think L only focused on criminals."
12959,That's kinda bad. What did you lie about?
12960,"Well, I suppose it is justified as long as you don't do it all the time."
12961,Thats good. Where did they find it?
12962,Is that how much doritos and a mountain dew costs there. geez
12963,"thats the same thing happening at my job , super lazy worker just walks around and hides in the restroom its annoying"
12964,"yes it does, i wish people like that would just get fired "
12965,That is horrible. Did you find out who did it?
12966,I think you should have put them in a difficult to reach for babies place
12967,"Oh no, did you go on time? "
12968,Just leave it. Try to be punctual here after.
12969,"I love flowers, that's great!"

12971,i have heard good things about that show.  are you a fan?
12972,is it going to be the last season? that's too bad.
12973,That sounds very nostalgic.
12974,Love was so innocent back then.
12975,"Oh geez, that is certainly cause for alarm. Did you summon the stoop kid?"
12976,"Ah, there is your problem right there. 99.9% of the time a stoop kid will chase away nasty pigeons, no problem."
12977,I never took the ACT
12978,I meant SAT. I took the ACT. how did you do in the end?
12979,Is that not funny? I think its hilarious
12980,Interesting. What lead to that?
12981,Were you guys close when you were younger?
12982,Man it's so much fun to just have a good conversation with people. 
12983,That's no good. Why are you upset with them?
12984,I would be equally as angry. I think I would've put them up for adoption.
12985,Why put ramen in the fridge?
12986,How are you  doing in college? because that is ridiculous lol
12987,Awwww yeah! ...what exactly is on?
12988,Yeah! Come on over here and we'll throw a regular ole pizza party!

12990,I'd vote you class president!
12991,corn dogs are yummy. where do you get yours from?
12992,"ew. that sounds bad. but if it was free, i guess that's a good thing."
12993,That's no good. Why did you feel like that?
12994,Oh no. Who was at the door? Was it a mime?
12995,"Oh no, I hope you pardon them. "
12996,This is too much of punishment for kids.
12997,"Oh that really cool.. I bet it was really complicated, huh?"
12998,It is always awesome to see a genius at work. a glimpse into their passion
12999,Oh no.. I hope you was not hurt
13000,"I can understand that. Dont feel bad, it happens to the best of us buddy :)"
13001,Oh no! did you file a police report?
13002,is your insurance going to take care of it?
13003,Oh yeah? I've been looking for a new show to watch. Which one is it?

13005,Shame on you! What did you buy?
13006,You should have bought ramen lol
13007,That's great! Are you going to be in the wedding?

13010,"Oh, Well have fun"
13011,Oh my gosh! Are you ok? I would be sick.
13012,Yikes! Maybe you shouldn't do that again.
13013,"Aw man, I've been there before. Don't regret it one bit. More food for us, right?"
13014,"Nah, you're good man. You probably did it for good reason."
13015,That is terrible news. I am so sorry.
13016,"You only have one mother, you should love her no matter what."
13017,how was the trip?
13018,Oh so where are you all going?

13030,I love rollercoasters!
13031,"I feel sorry for him too, although I don't know what for. Can you refresh my memory?"

13208,"That makes sense, since your feet are likely gonna smell too."
13209,I guess just take a spare pair with you!
13210,I could not even imagine how you would have felt.
13211,I do not like to be sad.
13212,I sure hope so.  It is making me a little blue.
13213,Yes I agree.  I have flowers and they need sun and rain.
13214,I have already done that and it is usually so depressing.
13215,It's good to get everything you need but I hate school in general.
13216,"I understand that completly, i also do not have a car."
13217,One day you will own many cars.
13218,Oh wow that's lucky! So they are paying for everything?

13227,"Oh.  I thought you said ""like"" at first.  I'm sorry.  I like them!  You should try watching more of them!"
13228,"I have never been, but i would be very unhappy about it."
13229,"I would be careful, it might break any time!"
13230,That's good to hear! What kind of car is it?
13231,What brand of car is it then?
13232,I think in person would have been better!
13233,Sometimes things are much better face to face.
13234,"I do not drive at all, i stay home."
13235,Stay indoors and no need for that!
13236,"Oh yes, I love taco Tuesday!"
13237,That must be a proud tradition.

13245,That's good.  I bet he was happy.
13246,Oh that's exciting! Have you gone before?
13247,"That's true, the experience is different when you're older."
13248,Trips are very expensive to go on.
13249,Food is so expensive these days.
13250,"So sweet, It's good to have pets with us."
13251,Have a happy life with your pets and enjoy with them.
13252,I only like american food!
13253,Food is the gateway to the soul.
13254,i am sorry to hear that. i hope it wasnt a bad break.

13256,Oh wow that's really exciting! You must be really happy.
13257,"That's great to hear, I hope his first day goes well!"
13258,"oh that sucks, i guess you called in to make up a lie and make up the quiz"
13259,"cool,, thats great"
13260,That's good to hear. What subject was this in?
13261,"Math is the worst sometimes, especially when you see the test and panic since you know nothing."
13262,Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Was anyone hurt?
13263,"I know it's hard to lose your stuff, but it can be replaced.  At least you are ok."
13264,Oh no! Did they reimburse you?
13265,I'm sure it is.  I would be furious!
13266,"Wow, congrats on my behalf."
13267,It's lovely. Be a happy couple. live long together!
13268,Oh no!  Did you call the police?
13269,Was it an accident? or on purpose?
13270,Why were you surprised? Is he shy?
13271,Some girls like a certain type. Or maybe it was written in the stars.
13272,That's so sweet!  I bet he is an awesome dad!
13273,This is true.  Did you have some good memorable times together?
13274,Thats good.  I'm glad to hear that.
13275,Oh cool! Where are you gonna do that?
13276,Oh yeah they are safe 99% of the time
13277,Aw I'm sorry. Can you retake the class?
13278,i understand. Those classes are expensive too.
13279,How cool! What did you think of it?
13280,"Wow, hopefully next time it may taste better!"
13281,That's a wonderful thing to hear!  Did you get through college?
13282,I bet they are!  You should take them out to dinner to celebrate!
13283,You're welcome and congrats on graduating!  That's such a great accomplishment!
13284,Nice! Where are you going?
13285,That should be a good trip for you.  Ever been there?
13286,Wow that is absolutely tragic to hear. That's so cruel of them.
13287,Wow really?
13288,I hope you guys were alright?
13289,Oh really? Why's that?
13290,"Oh cool, I'm doing that too in a few days!"
13291,Oops.  I didn't mean to type 5 LOL.  I hope you get to take breaks to go see your cat on the weekends :(
13292,did you watch them with someone special?
13293,aw that's sweet.  I'm sure they loved it more than you know.
13294,Oh really? Does it make you anxious?
13295,"That's a bad outlook, you should stay positive!"
13296,Oh no. What grade did you get?
13297,Thats great I happy for you. Its a positive step.
13298,Why's that? Something important?
13299,Oh wow that's exciting! I'm happy for you.
13300,Aww.  How do you feel about that?
13301,Yeah I bet.  Hey at least you're out there trying.  That's all you can really do.
13302,"Me too! I like to win, I guess that makes me competitive."
13303,"It is a good thing, it gives you an edge."
13304,Oh yea? when is the trip?
13305,I bet you are going with a loved one that's why you are so anxious about the trip
13306,oh yea did you do a good job to get one?
13307,thats great nice job
13308,Why what happened? Hopefully nothing bad.
13309,"Don't worry, I'm sure you did fine."
13310,"I know what you mean, that has happened to me before and it is an awful feeling."
13311,"It probably isn't, I really hope it isn't too."
13312,Sorry to hear that. What did your friends say?
13313,Hopefully your friends make it up to you!
13314,Yeah isn't that awesome!  What kind of dog do you have?
13315,Aww that's so cute!  Does he do any tricks?
13316,hehe how adorable!  Give him kisses for me!
13317,What is your test about?
13318,"Oh nice, I worked at a pharmacy while I was in high school and I loved it. I thought about getting that certification. Is it hard?"
13319,"wow, that is such a special occasion!what a gift"
13320,because you witnessed it.
13321,Oh that's exciting! Are you gonna propose or what?
13322,"That sounds so nice, I wish I had a long term relationship like that!"
13323,Oh thats good 
13324,It's always a good thing to turn things around
13325,Was a happy shocked feeling or a bad one?
13326,Thats great. where was the trip to and who with?
13327,oh really why is that?
13328,oh dang thats a real thinker
13329,I know that feeling. I get it when I feel anxious.
13330,Have you tried yoga and meditation? It can help.
13331,"Oh no, so sorry. Was your son okay?"
13332,Thats so unfortunate. I hope he learnt he's lesson. On the brighter side is that your son is okay.
13333,sounds super fun
13334,Oh that's awesome!  Where you going?
13335,Cool!  I've never been there.  Are you excited to go?
13336,That sounds terrible. I would expect nothing less for a presumably high cost hotel. 
13337,"That's good but should also be standard for any hotel, nevertheless a 5 star one. How was the new room?"
13338,You must have been rather disappointed. But its the thought that counts.
13339,"True, they only want the best for us. Sometimes that can mean making hard decisions, such as foregoing the bike."
13340,Oh cool! What job does she work?
13341,That's really nice! Glad to hear that she is moving up the ladder!
13342,if it's someone you know you should ask them not to do it again
13343,oh thats bad!
13344,I bet they will.  That's the way to look at things.  With some optimism!
13345,Yeah.  Well I wish you luck my friend.  Keep your head up!
13346,Ohh thats nice. May I ask what for?
13347,What an amazing women. She must be very strong.
13348,I'm not one to judge. We all have done things we regret in the past. Why did you do it though?
13349,"Well I guess you learnt a valuable lesson, just don't do it again."
13350,yea i know what you mean
13351,yea it sucks to think it might fail
13352,"Wow, that's really nice of your father! What type of car did he get you?"
13353,That's nice that you can depend on your father.
13354,"Oh my, what movie was it?!"
13355,You must have had trouble sleeping that night!
13356,Sounds like trouble. What did he do?
13357,Thanks that was very helpful.
13358,so sad
13359,it is alright
13360,I'm glad that I don't have to deal with any of that for a few more weeks of summer vacation.
13361,Well I hope that you do well on that exam!
13362,"wow i can relate, feels goof knowing you will do well so you can not worry about it"
13363,yea exactly
13364,nice
13365,i bet .that is always a tough situation.
13366,are you still civil with them?
13367,Congratulations! It must be exciting to live on your own!
13368,It's nice to have company and make close friends during college.
13369,Oh that's always nice. What made you feel that?
13370,"Aw that's funny, I always love those kinds of heartwarming moments."
13371,I can imagine it can be stressful!
13372,"Yes, and fortunately you will have many more!"
13373,awww how cool. what was it?
13374,that sounds very cool!
13375,Aw that's annoying when my cat does that too.
13376,Especially when they seem to do it in the worst place possible.
13377,"yea i know what you mean, austin should share"
13378,Thats awesome. B is great and you'll smash it next time.
13379,"I guess to keep on trying and don't be so hard on yourself, a B grade is good enough too."
13380,Give me an example of something that happened then.
13381,"I know what you mean, I'm really really shy too."
13382,"Sometimes it just gets a little overwhelming. There can just be too much going on at once, especially if you have more than one child."
13383,"You just have to do what is best for you and your family. One day your kids will understand, especially when they have kids of their own and have so many other things going on."
13384,that is a very good achievement to hear
13385,what do you do for you to become the best employee?
13386,That is true
13387,"Medics are life savers, so you must trust them with your life"
13388,Which class was that? I'm glad to hear that.
13389,I'm about to go into that same class so I hope I do well too.
13390,yea i loved doing that all summer
13391,"same, its quite cool"
13392,That's great! What job did you get?
13393,"That's the same kind of job that I'm looking to get, so that's awesome!"
13394,You need to wipe away the guilt and seek forgiveness for yourself.
13395,"Yes stealing is a bad act, but now you have learned your lesson!"
13396,Oh no! What had happened to you?
13397,That's a tough situation. I hope you are able to make the best move for you.
13398,me too I love them and I am very excited as well
13399,I know they'll make so much money from it within the first week of release
13400,i know what you mean i wish i had either
13401,"yea i know, my friend max has that too and i would like a girlfriend but its tough"
13402,That's so painful. I hope it didn't hurt for too long.
13403,"I know what you mean, it can linger sometimes."
13404,i know how you feel
13405,thats an unhealthy way to think but its hard to avoid
13406,Thats not nice for you. Did you try meeting people?
13407,"I know exactly how you feel as I'm one too. Keep at it though as deep within us, theres a great spirit there."
13408,did you enjoy it?
13409,what was the movie about?
13410,It's excellent. My hearty congrats to you!
13411,have a excellent career ahead to you!! 
13412,"I agree, nothing like seeing them smile and have fun!"
13413,Yup. Enjoy it whilst they're young! 
13414,"That's great, I don't pray often because I'm not too religious..."
13415,"Yes, count your blessings because there are people who do not have it as good as you"
13416,Did you start to feel a bit lonely?
13417,"That's tough, but it helps you learn what you like to do on your own."
13418,Stolen? That's horrible!
13419,"I really hope so too, whoever did it is an awful person."
13420,That's precious. How old are they?
13421,"They are really starting to grow up, you better cherish them while you can."
13422,"Sorry dude, thats rough. Do you know why she did that?"
13423,"Women. Keep strong dude, theres someone out there for you."
13424,oh yea i know what you mean
13425,it really does feel bad tho
13426,It's important to spend time with your friends while you can!
13427,Make some good memories and enjoy these next few weeks.
13428,"Great, I bet he did a good job "
13429,"I know, it's probably because you are related "
13430,"I agree, people who do animal cruelty should be in jail."
13431,"Yes, we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools."
13432,"wow, really, what was the result?"
13433,"really, that is excellent, you are a genius"
13434,"Oh no that's too bad, it wasn't your fault at least."
13435,"Yeah, just make sure that you aren't in too much of a rush like that."
13436,Really? Congrats 
13437,That's a cool ride
13438,That is nice. Did she like it?
13439,Don't upset for her. May be she isn't worth for your love.
13440,"Yeah, I can understand your feelings for her."
13441,Oh really? Why do you think that is?
13442,Aw I know that feeling since I had a big brother.
13443,yea i know how you feel
13444,yea i hate clowns too
13445,Sorry to hear that. That must have been lonely.
13446,Hopefully you can make new friends and explore new places with them!
13447,did you return it?
13448,did the get mad at you?
13449,"Oh my, were you rushed to the hospital?"
13450,I can see why. Are you alright now?
13451,really? what happened afterwards?
13452,I hope you didn't hurt yourself
13453,Me too. Its always fun during Christmas 
13454,Don't feel bad for the opportunity that you have. Life is not set out on an even keel so we all must make the best of our lot.
13455,I'm happy that you have this opportunity in life. Keep at it and be thankful for it.
13456,"Same, I can never go into public bathrooms for this exact reason. It is amazing how bad it smells in one of those!"
13457,"Yeah, pretty much all humans would rather smell good things than bad lol. I hope you can get over this phobia though as I know how it feels to just despise something."
13458,that is a slap in the face.
13459,it happens to the best of us
13460,What job did you apply to then?
13461,"I'm sure you'll get the job, buddy!"
13462,So exciting! What did you do with that money?
13463,Thats good! I would have just spent it on drinks!
13464,Really! That must have bee so frustrating for you.
13465,jealous? Not sure why your jealous of somebody being inconsiderate.
13466,You always hope that is the case. Sounds like it didn't turn out well. I'm sorry.
13467,That's terrible and really not fair to you. I feel so bad you had to go through that. 
13468,Well good luck and I'm sure you will.
13469,Your very confident. I guess thats a good attitude to have.
13470,I wish I was more like that.
13471,You must be prepared for anything then.
13472,oh really? that must sting
13473,yea i can see why you would be
13474,You must have been disappointed. Did you ask why you didnt get it?
13475,I would be too. But there will be plenty of other opportunities! 
13476,Why are you nervous?
13477,yea i agree with that
13478,yea its not mucht ho
13479,You must have been disappointed in that! Was it an important class?
13480,"You will, you need to keep at it!"
13481,That's so inspiring! How did he do that?
13482,"Oh wow, what a claim to fame! "
13483,"I know what you mean, it's the excitement that keeps you up!"
13484,I would always try to sneak a peak of the gifts when my parents were not looking.
13485,I know right. Did your Mum ask you to see if you wanted it also?
13486,Oh no. I'm sorry. Families can be tough.
13487,That is true?
13488,To whom did you give instructions? 
13489,Did you feel powerful giving instructions? 
13490,"Excellent, you must feel proud of him as well!"
13491,As you should be! It takes a lot of hard work.
13492,It is nice that both of you still share good memories.
13493,I hate it when that happens. Where you doing anything important when it happened?
13494,Making money doing what? I hope you got it all sorted out though.
13495,thats great you should feel proud
13496,thats pretty sweet
13497,Well done to you. Not everyone has that type of focus. What where you studying for?
13498,Thats great. Did you ace the test?
13499,have you had a lot of bad experiences?
13500,i do agree with you there.
13501,"oh my, I hope you were alright?"
13502,I'm glad you are alright!
13503,Financing can be scary but a lot of places now have really great rates for auto loans.
13504,That sounds like a plan. It make take a while though to save that much so just be patient.
13505,I am not a fan either
13506,I definitely agree
13507,Sorry for that. I hate last minute cancellations. Did he have a good reason?
13508,Who needs friends like that. So what did you do? 
13509,I understand. I have the feeling. Most people are now looking only for their interests.
13510,Thats great isn't it. I hate it when managers just boss you around and never listen. 
13511,I'm happy for you that this new manager is better. It just makes working a whole lot better and more enjoyable.
13512,I like secrets. Did it turn out the way that you hoped it would.
13513,It was nice that you had him to turn to for help.
13514,You must have been rather surprised. Did you thank her for it?
13515,What a nice person. You should throw a party for her! 
13516,What are you studying
13517,That does sound nice
13518,You must have worked hard for it! You deserve it then.
13519,Good. Hopefully you continue to prepare well for the future challenges.
13520,Sorry to hear that. That is bad. What your manager did say about it?
13521,That is ok if they understood the situation. It will be fine.
13522,wow what a horrible thing to walk into!
13523,I hope it was fixed that day
13524,Any good emotions
13525,Those are nice feelings to have
13526,"Oh my, why was she arrested?"
13527,You shouldnt feel ashamed of your moms action. It was not your fault.
13528,Sounds like you may be choosing the same kind of person each time. There are good ones. If you give up now you may lose the chance to find the person who is right for you.
13529,I know it's hard. Just don't give up. 
13530,I understand how you feel
13531,I bet you will be able to mend the fences after this meeting
13532,That is great to have fun.
13533,That might be true
13534,You must have thanked him for it! What was the present?
13535,That is so helpful. I wish my brother would get me such presents.
13536,What kind of emotions
13537,I can understand
13538,I miss those times too
13539,I am confused by that as well
13540,I would had the same reaction. Why did they fire you?
13541,I understand. I hope you will find a better job.
13542,I bet that was a nice feeling
13543,I am happy for you
13544,Was it good>
13545,sounds like a good weekend!
13546,What could go wrong when you're taking an exam?
13547,"I understand that but I think you will be fine! We all get that fear when it comes to an important test, it means we're human and still feel things!"
13548,Ugh dentist visits are the worst. Atleast you can look forward to taking a break from work.
13549,"Oh yes, but sometimes my boss let me off when I have to go to the dentist!"
13550,That's quite an investment. It must have made you feel good to be buying it with your own money.
13551,That was really nice of you. I'm sure that he appreciated it.
13552,Oh I am sorry to hear that... do you have plans on trying again?
13553,"Yes unfortunately it is... Last time I went, it rained most of the day"
13554,That sounds like a great time. 
13555,It is nice that you still have those 
13556,are you happy about that?
13557,that sounds good! I rather work earlier and leave earlier
13558,So you have to do the whole process with the passport over again??
13559,I would ask the people in charge who lost my paperwork? And tell them to go find the paperwork! 
13560,I feel sorry for you. Did you get another job?
13561,Good. Hope you've an wonderful career ahead!
13562,That was nice of you
13563,I am glad he did well
13564,That is nice. Is she better?
13565,Good. She will have more trust in you now.
13566,He is smart to be that rich
13567,"thats awesome,a boy or girl?"
13568,Great! I have 3 boys.  3 2 and 6 months haha
13569,400 plasma?
13570,Oh really?
13571,lol. That's no problem
13572,That is tough. That is so nice of you to be there for them
13573,Sounds like you are a really great friend
13574,What are you guys going to do
13575,He sounds cool
13576,It is always good to have things prepared in advance so you can get them done quick and easy.
13577,I hate having to get everything ready at the last minute. It seems to hectic and chaotic when you do things that way.
13578,"I am sorry, it happens though"
13579,I am sure she will forgive you
13580,Did she give you a reason why?
13581,I'm sorry but maybe something came up for her that's a little personal?
13582,Did he all get A's?
13583,I would be proud too. That takes a lot of effort to get straight A's.
13584,How did it go
13585,Oh was it a nice house?
13586,That's good for them then.  I hope you get to buy a new home too.
13587,Oh no! That's not good! What's going on?
13588,That's not a good environment to be in. Maybe you can find something else quickly.
13589,Congratulations! I am sure you deserve it.
13590,You will climb high in the company with that good attitude.
13591,Why are you nervous?  Just try to be confident
13592,Change your way of thinking.  Maybe you are out of her league!
13593,I am sorry you were mad
13594,It will get better
13595,Did he come to pick you up?
13596,That is great to have someone that you can trust.
13597,That's a good thing. A lot of people usually have to work on their weekends off instead of relaxing.
13598,What did you do to relax during the weekend?
13599,"Oh my lord,  how long to you think it had been there"
13600,"Thats not good,  was he all smashed up?"
13601,That sounds scary
13602,I am glad you were okay
13603,Hahahaha funny though. Did he have something to do with it?
13604,Ohhhh that's not fair
13605,What happened? did someone scare you?
13606,"That is no good, But maybe he deserved it."
13607,Are you excited for it?
13608,"Wow you are really speeding things up there, aren't you?"
13609,"WHAT? did, you have any idea beforehand,  or he just showed up with your idea."
13610,OH no! I didnt even think about that.  That must have been terrible.
13611,"Oh no,  How long did he live?  is he still alive?"
13612,"Thats not very long, I am sorry for your loss."
13613,Why were you late getting to work?
13614,Your boss should really understand things like that happen and not yell at you.
13615,It's always great to reconnect. Sounds like it was lots of fun.
13616,You should make plans to do it again soon.
13617,Sounds like she did well
13618,What kind of surgery
13619,Why you didn't go with her?
13620,That is bad. You should had planned your vacation together.
13621,They say for the prepared there is no such things as a surprise test.
13622,So how did you do on the test?
13623,That's good to have a brother like that. Most don't seem to get along.
13624,That's good. Myself and my sister have gotten closer as we got older.
13625,Taxes are always tough
13626,I am there now
13627,That is nice. Where are you going kayaking?
13628,Have fun.
13629,That was nice of her ha
13630,That does sound stressful
13631,I would have been too we get them bad here. Are you in the south? 
13632,"Same here, prepping for hurricane season. Stay safe! "
13633,That's such a cowardly thing to do. Was there much damage?
13634,It could have been worse. 
13635,"Me too,  is there anything in particular you appreciate the most?"
13636,That's definitely a plus for us.
13637,Nice! Was it something you were needing?
13638,Was it for your birthday or a random gift? Wish I could receive random gifts
13639,"Congratulations, thats awesome"
13640,I do play basketball sometimes
13641,"Oh well, its over now"
13642,being sick sucks they shoulda came over atleast to bring you a goody bag 
13643,right tell them so next time they do! 
13644,LOL.....doesn't sound storm prep to me.
13645,It wasn't a Hurricane Party was it?
13646,I hate spiders too
13647,That sounds stressful
13648,Did you get it done
13649,Thats a good start
13650,You were prepared for sure. Did you get the grades yet? 
13651,thats good! im happy for you! 
13652,That sounds wonderful!  What are your plans?
13653,That's great news!  You must be so happy! Congratulations!
13654,Don't worry. Why do you think it will cost higher?
13655,"Oh, hope it will be less cost. "
13656,That's a good choice.  What makes you want to join?
13657,That's as good as any reason.  When will you sign up?
13658,We never are prepared for something like that.. how long ago was it? 
13659,I understand! Its been about the same for me since my parents passed and it doesnt hurt any less.  Im sorry but I can tell you are strong! 
13660,"I believe that, how did it happen?"
13661,"That is scary, it is not even your fault at all either"
13662,That is so gross. I hope you told the manager and got a refund.
13663,"Yeah, I would have said the same things. Aren't they supposed to wear hair nets anyway? Thats's not acceptable."
13664,Wow that is a nice surprise! You must have done very ywell.
13665,What kind of car did you get?
13666,Did you call the cops on them?
13667,"That is smart, I think that is the best bet"
13668,unexpected is even better than expected! congrats! 
13669,my god i would be too pop the bubbly! 
13670,"Oh man, I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm sure as time goes on it will become less and less."
13671,I can only imagine.
13672,"I hate to hear that, did you have many memories of playing in those woods?"
13673,"Well, it would have upset me as well. "
13674,That is awesome! wow congrats to you! What kinda car? 
13675,Really good on gas and small which is good for a first car. good for you nice of them! 
13676,What did he lie about?

13678,"My first time I sang the song from the movie Oklahoma called Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'.  I'm kind of dorky though."
13679,"That's sad, did they say why?"
13680,"Oh, It's excellent. "
13681,Hope you'll have one soon.
13682,Sounds like you are blissfully happy. That's a great feeling.
13683,Don't let negativity creep in. Enjoy the moment.
13684,What show is it?
13685,"Ah, I have heard they are brutal with the killings in that show"
13686,I'm so sorry! Is everything ok?
13687,Are you sick or just not feeling well?
13688,No
13689,Really? Why did they give her a car?
13690,Thats the worst when you do something for someone and they dont even appear to care! 
13691,Same! Two wrongs never make a right.  You are doing the right thing. 
13692,"That's really cool, do you still keep in contact with them?"
13693,"Yeah for sure, i hardly speak with any of my highschool friends either."
13694,Oh sorry to hear that.. Don't you like florida?
13695,Thats true.. But why don't you give it a chance? may be you will end up liking it
13696,So sorry to hear that buddy.. where were you planning to go?
13697,"Yeah, i can sense how you feel.. It is ok buddy, you will make it there soon enough"
13698,Oh no.. why would they do that
13699,"I understand that buddy.. Cheer up, something better will come along soon enough"
13700,That is a great accomplishment!  You must be very proud!  Congratulations!
13701,Your family is most likely just as proud!
13702,awesome! extra money is always welcome right! Any special plans with it? 
13703,so sweet of you and sounds like a lot of fun enjoy! 
13704,"I completely understand your point, even i get emotional about my family"
13705,"And we should.. family comes above all, right?"
13706,That's true.. It is challenging. how old are you?
13707,"It is natural to feel that way in early 20's, trust me. you will adapt with time though :)"
13708,"That is not good, did you complain?"
13709,How old are you now?
13710,Hmm.. Don't worry about it. You'll get the hang of adulting soon enough.
13711,"Yeah, i hear you.. I can see how that can invoke envy.. you'll get there soon"
13712,"You won't be, i assure you. Do your part and hope for the best. :)"
13713,I have seen previews for it. Looks exciting. 
13714,You aren't going to be able to sleep thinking about it.
13715,Ughhh its so hard to keep good secrets tho honestly! 
13716,I agree with you! What are you into watching right now?
13717,"I've been looking forward to get some time to sit down and watch it, I can't wait!"
13718,You are so right. I dont get it
13719,ITs weird that mens bathroom are sometimes cleaner. 
13720,What did he win?
13721,That's terrible.
13722,Where they too loud?
13723,usually people who work weekends. It's pretty rude they were so inconsiderate. 
13724,I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! 
13725,That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a good time?
13726,That's great to hear. The county fair is always a nice opportunity to spend time out with family.
13727,They can be difficult.  What is the issue?
13728,My kids eat all my snacks too.  Parent struggles are real.
13729,Yes it was! I loved collecting the cards. They have pokemon go now 
13730, I liked it too it was fun to get out and get walking. 
13731,Did you let her?
13732,"I get that, swimming can be dangerous for kids"
13733,Are they older or younger?
13734,I can understand why they mean so much to you!
13735,"I get that I guess, but that is life sometimes"
13736,Thats awesome!!! you will save a lot of money for sure. 
13737,Yup thats how it is sure a car payment is expensive but it pretty much saves you money in the long haul and looks a lot nicer! 
13738,i know how that feels
13739,once you get it over with you will feel better
13740,I don't blame you. It removes your sense of security and change can always bring out fear.
13741,"One day you will be comfortable where your new home and not want to leave there either, it will only take some time."
13742,"Well, water's water, so it should work out ok."
13743,"Oh.  Dang.  Well, I guess I was wrong then :P"
13744,I haven't been to a fair in so long.
13745,That's cool. Did you meet some cool people.
13746,Mine started last week.
13747,"I kinda miss them, and our schedule gets a lot busier when schools in."
13748,do you own a harley ?
13749,its not literally your day off because you are here working talking to me lol
13750,You may want to think about not letting her borrow it anymore.  Sounds pretty rude to me.
13751,Maybe ask her to set the time when she can return it so you have a better idea when to expect it back.
13752,What did you call for?
13753,Im sorry about that
13754,What's wrong with your brakes
13755,You can always stop at a shop and have someone check it out
13756,Are you sure you didn't get an offer but they are running behind?
13757,"I'm sorry, I'm sure you will find something soon."
13758,"Ouch, that could be bad.  What was her reason?"
13759,That's a tough thing to watch happen.  Just be there to support her when she needs it.
13760,do you guys still work there ?
13761,such an accomplishment
13762,Well that's sweet. I bet they love you
13763,How many  do you have?
13764,You should take a vacation! That always helps me clear my mind.
13765,"Oh man, that is rough. I'm really sorry to hear that. Hang in there!"
13766,"They did.  I've struggled with trying to be more social, I think it makes life more fun."
13767,It really is.  Wonder how we can go about changing things.
13768,Oh wow! Thats awesome. What type of car?
13769,Oh sweet! well congrats
13770,That can be dangerous.
13771,I hope no one gets hurt
13772,i could agree with this
13773,same here but mostly at xmas time
13774,That is awesome. What do you do?
13775,"That is great, I am so happy for you"
13776,For a party?
13777,I hate when that happens. I hope you complained and got a refund
13778,I love DR. Pepper. It's just so hard for me to keep the weight down if I continue to drink it.
13779,I try to keep it in moderation now but even that is hard. It's so addicting.
13780,I remember playing that on the wii
13781,Will it be available on xbox?
13782,How is that feeling today?
13783,"That is okay, everyone knows it is nasty anyways"
13784,time heals all pain
13785,which is understandable
13786,"I get that, he was a very funny fellow, sad story"
13787,"I did not really, so I see how you would be more attached"
13788,What did he make you?
13789,"Well, at least he tried. You have to be happy about that."
13790,That is so true! Some woman aren't loyal
13791,Its great you trust an awesome woman
13792,Oh! That's great to hear. What were you fighting about?
13793,"It's normal to fight about things as a couple, but I would wait a little longer before you decide to get married :)"
13794,Cruises are fun. What is the problem?
13795,Two weeks is a long time.
13796,I wouldnt risk it
13797,That's pretty mean... jeez
13798,I'm gonna tell on you.
13799,"well, that's not nice at all."
13800,you can confront them about it.
13801,No!!! I would die!!
13802,Did you kill it??
13803,That's nice :)  I do that with pictures of my wife.
13804,I hear you.  The best motivation is family.
13805,Big plans?
13806,that's awesome!
13807,I bet you were very nervous that day.
13808,That is so true! 
13809,Weve been together for 10 years. 
13810,What kind of sofa is it?
13811,That is awesome! Congratulations
13812,That is awesome! I dont think anyone should feel ashamed of what they look like in a bathing suit. We all have imperfections!
13813,I think we are all our own best critics and can be too hard on ourselves when it comes to appearances.
13814,that's great to hear! I love when people help each other
13815,oh i know. I always try to help as much as i can. i donate clothes and food
13816,That has happened to me too. What did you do?
13817,Aw.  A little mice won't hurt you. It's more afraid of you then you are of it.
13818,Did it run after you?
13819,Did you scream loudly and run?
13820,Oh no. That had to be painful
13821,I know how you feel. At least its not on youtube
13822,and epically failing lol
13823,Did she not study enough?
13824,That's no good. What grade is she in?
13825,Cool. Have you found a place?
13826,Well that's nice. IS it going well?
13827,That really stinks! Did you complain to him? 
13828,Wow...What a bad neighbor! Maybe insurance will cover it?
13829,That sucks.  Do you always try specific diets or do you sometimes just try to eat less?
13830,"That's the worst part, the late night hungers."
13831,OH that's terrible. Even worse that's in baby soap?
13832,Well you dodged one bullet.
13833,Thats great for them! 
13834,"Yeah that can feel disappointing, and you can feel left out. Im sorry thats how it is for you. Maybe you will meet someone at their wedding?"
13835,Oh no!  That might be one of my worst fears!  Could you sleep any more after?
13836,"I've heard of it, but I can't even imagine going through it.  I'm sorry it happened to you."
13837,That sucks.  I hate when friends move away.  Are you really good friends with them?
13838,At least she's moving for a good reason.  I had a similar thing with a childhood friend who moved for school.
13839,That stinks :( Why did you have to work late?
13840,You should quit. There's nothing worse than a workplace with employees who can't carry their own weight.
13841,I'm sorry you're having trouble :(  Is there anyone you can talk to about it?
13842,There's never too much :)  You can always find someone online or a therapist who you haven't talked to before.
13843,I hear you. It's been super hot and humid here for weeks. The only time i get out of the house is to go to the pool or get groceries lol
13844,why not? the pool is nice and cool :) i just hate staying home for a long time
13845,Is it more of verbal arguing or flat out physical fights?
13846,Wow. What do they usually argue about? 
13847,"my family gets into politics a lot, but fortunately it rarely turns hostile."
13848,Congratulations! Thats awesome!
13849,I bet! I would be the same If i had a niece
13850,"That's good, stress is so common in life so it's easy to become overwhelmed."
13851,"That's an impressive philosophy, you seem to have grit so I think you will go far."
13852,That's very nice of you. We need more compassion in the world for sure.
13853,I understand. But my family turns a deaf ear. I'm pleased that you did not.
13854,"Oh no, were you happy about not having to work?"
13855,"I suppose your right, money matters"
13856,"Aw, that's nice.  Do you have a lot of good memories of high school?"
13857,"My experience wasn't that great, but I still had good times back then."
13858,"it happens to everyone , i stole too"
13859,"its over with, dont even worry about it"
13860,"I was devastated as well, he brought joy to all"
13861,"Oh wow, what was that like?"
13862,"Oh, how did that go? It sounds important."
13863,"That's wonderful, it must feel good to see your preparation pay off."
13864,What sort of meat did they have?
13865,Sounds really tasty
13866,Oh man. Was it body odor like he hasn't showered or something on him like smoke or animal stink?
13867,yeah I typically can't stand the smell of BO either. There really is no excuse. Just take a shower man!
13868,"Holy moly! I hate spiders...You should spray your house more, just in case!"
13869,"Hahaha! I would too, but keep some bug spray close too!"
13870,What is the square footage?
13871,"Thats a good size, good area as well?"
13872,consider yourself lucky
13873,better that than to be drowned in studen tloan
13874,I would be upset too! Why would they do that? did you try talking to teachers or principal?
13875,gosh that's frustrating! I'm sorry to hear that
13876,Anyplace near you where you can get a cup?
13877,"ok, that will do you I think at least for todayl."
13878,"Nice.  I've never had luck with being unprepared for things, I always choke."
13879,Probably.  I'm just bad at faking it :P
13880,That is awful! Did you break up with him?
13881,Well I hope you can trust him again!
13882,4? 
13883,Aw man they are usually a lot of fun. Why are you nervous?
13884,"aww, that's so sweet of your co workers! You're definitely appreciated there"
13885,I love surprises like that! What kind of cake did they get?
13886,How many hours a day are you training
13887,"Good For you, I am really envious of people that take the time to work on their body"
13888,ewww! that's gross. I actually made a toast for my son yesterday and when i was about to give it to him i noticed a little bit of mold on the side. i almost threw up
13889,i bet your appetite was ruined!
13890,How do you think the interview went?
13891,"Yes, that uncertainty is always tough to deal with.  But I hope you get the job!"
13892,What were some of your favorites?
13893,"I see, hopefully someone can fulfill his role"
13894,like what kind
13895,dont we all
13896,That's great! Have you been doing ok this year?
13897,That's really rough. Im sorry. I hope everything goes well for you
13898,"Aw man. Who has been working there longer, you or the co-worker?"
13899,Did you receive any sort of feedback as to why you might have been passed over?
13900,Boooo! Yeah. Might be worth chatting with HR to see if there are any pointers you can get so maybe next time will go in your favor.
13901,Oh no! That's unfortunate...did you guys reconcile?
13902,That's great to have that kind of support!
13903,I think so.  Generally getting more or less than what you deserve to get is unbalanced.
13904,I can understand that.  Hopefully everything works out in the end though.
13905,Im sorry! Are you going to be ok?
13906,I bet. It stinks that that is happening to you
13907,Yeah that's terrible. is you cat fixed?
13908,That might be why she does it. It's something to consider.
13909,"oh no, that's bad :( what did you lie about?"
13910,that's not good :( so i bet your wife asked you if you give him something and you said no? you should tell her
13911,"Been there myself, the anticipation can really get to you.  What kind of job is it?"
13912,"Finacial analyst, sounds impressive.  Good luck, I hope you do well and get it."
13913,COuld you explain why?
13914,How much was in and why not return the cards and id's?
13915,Do you miss your grandmother?
13916,Did you get a picture of just her or does it also have you in the picture?
13917,Any luck yet on that?
13918,"Well, I wish you luck. Maybe you need a distraction."
13919,Could you prepare or ask for help on it?
13920,Do your best and be confident about your work
13921,OH NO! Is it fixable or totally destroyed?
13922,Understandable I would be too. Did you explain to them the severity of what they did?
13923,"Oh nice, I'm sure that is quite a relief. Where are you going?"
13924,I hear it's really nice there this time of year. I hope you have a good time!
13925,That's awesome. Have you been bowling for a long time?
13926,Have you ever bowled a perfect game?
13927,Congrats! How long have you been with your company?
13928,"Good job, keep on moving up!"
13929,Maybe is time for vacations?
13930,May a change of jobs?
13931,I'm a very apolitical person. 
13932,"not really. I'm a felon. I don't get to vote. So I have no representation. That makes me a Subject of the U.S., instead of a citizen."
13933,That's embarassing.  What was their reaction?
13934,Pretend with her.  Maybe it's best to act like it didn't happen.
13935,What did they do?
13936,Did they know that the dress you were wanting?
13937,Aw. I'm sorry. I'd say you have reason to be upset. I probably would be too.
13938,What happened to you?
13939,Did you ever move out?
13940,"Good, make sure you take your time and do your best"
13941,I havent been a county fair in ages. Did you make yourself sick eating junk food?
13942,Of course. The rides are great. Should have at least had a funnel cake.
13943,How long has he been playing?
13944,so along time?
13945,I'm really sorry to hear that. How long ago was that?
13946,Oh wow. I didn't know about it. Are you doing alright?
13947,That's good to hear. How long have you been married?
13948,That's great. Do you have any children?
13949,"Oh no, did you ask  the restaurant if they have video?"
13950,"Thats unfortunate, the bright side is that it wasnt stolen and the car is still in good working condition"
13951,That was rude. Did you confront them?
13952,I suggest you just ask them why they didn't invite you straight up. No need to sugarcoat the main topic
13953,"Wow, that's pretty early!"
13954,I bet he was. Did you record it?
13955,"awww, i used to play sega with my brother :) it was awesome. streets of rage was my favorite game"
13956,oh man!!! I remember contra!! It's a shooting game right? gosh we used to play this game a lot!!
13957,Same.  There's a lot of things I wish I could go back to for a while.
13958,That's the bad part about time :)
13959,Really? Maybe you should ask your boss for a raise.
13960,"Oh, well that's no good.... you deserve to be paid more for your hard work."
13961,"Uau, that was a close call indeed."
13962,"I not going to even try that, thanks"
13963,"That is interesting, why do you say that?"
13964,I think a good amount of people feel the same
13965,"Yeah, I know how that goes."
13966,"Yeah, definitely. I'm always looking for ways to make more money."
13967,They do grow up quickly don't they! But just think of all the wonderful new things he'll learn and friends he'll make. He'll be able to tell you all about it when he gets home!
13968,"That's a definite plus. You'll be able to have a little ""me"" time, which is also important."
13969,"That's great, on both counts. You must be so proud of them both."
13970,Ha! I remember when my nephew was born. I visited my sister-in-law at the hospital. He's 21 now!
13971,That sounds really annoying. Have you said anything to them about it?
13972,Oh that's not good at all. I can't believe they just let their dog do that.
13973,That is very nice. Did you feel better after that?
13974,That is very good and I am glad!
13975,"Oh really, good for you!"
13976,I hope you do. Good luck!
13977,"Yeah, I hate getting stuck in traffic."
13978,Sometimes taking the long route will get you there faster.
13979,what???? That's terrible!! what a horrible person!
13980,"I bet! I mean you pay for gym membership, you can stay on any equipment as long as you want!"
13981,That's great! Congratulations. How much weight have you lost?
13982,Thats fantastic. Keep it up
13983,"I agree. If you can't trust family, then who can you trust?"
13984,Oh... well I guess you can't always trust family. But at least you can trust your wife and kids!
13985,Don't worry too much! I'm sure you'll do great.
13986,"Yeah, everything will work out. That kind of thing is totally normal."
13987,Ugh that is so annoying. I try not to do that when I with my girlfriend.
13988,have you talked to him about it? How much it bothers you.
13989,That is awesome. Sounds like you studied hard!
13990,"Awesome, great job!"
13991,I'm sorry. That must make you sad.
13992,Glad there's hope for you.
13993,Will they be improving by alot?
13994,"Wow, that's a whole bunch right there. Congrats!"
13995,"Oh jeez, did you ask him why he did that?"
13996,"I see, well kids will be kids"
13997,Whoa!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you want to kill the guy?
13998,"Yeah I suppose I would be too.  Well, if you're marriage survived, I hope things are better now."
13999,I bet that was a nice surprise!
14000,Well I'm happy for you. Spend it on something nice for yourself.
14001,"Nice! That's an odd day to be paid, but good for you!"
14002,Ooooh I love bonuses. Do you have any fun plans for it?
14003,Did you feed it lately?
14004,Maybe he is just missing you and wants to cuddle or something.
14005,Losing a pet is a hard thing.  Was the cat old or sick?
14006,Did you do anything special to honor it?
14007,That's no good! Did it stain your clothes?
14008,"Oh wow, it sounds like you were just really unlucky that night."
14009,"That sucks, did you mess up on some job activities?"
14010,"Oh, maybe you should tell your boss about how noone likes him?"
14011,Did you eat something?
14012,Toss it in the fridge or freezer. That's what I always do. Food for a rainy day :D
14013,I bet you are super excited for it. When are you going to be together/ 
14014,Well good for you. I didnt even know you had internet in prison! Lucky you. lol
14015,I pray he gets well soon. I had a similar experience so I know how it feels
14016,"Great, congratulations"
14017,Congrats.You must be very proud of her.
14018,The talent on your family is abundant.
14019,When will you be going?
14020,That sounds really nice.
14021,Was it a poisonous one?
14022,Did everything turn out alright.
14023,Probably for the best then.
14024,That's great! Congratulations and well done. He must practice long and hard to get to that stage in the game.
14025,"Then its all paid off and you should both be very proud. Perhaps he'll turn pro, do you think?"
14026,"Aw, well you can't win everything. Be happy for her!"
14027,Was there a prize you wanted from it? Or just recognition?
14028,Thats a bummer! I hope you guys can plan something together once the deadline is over! 
14029,I know :/ ...just make sure you do something fun when you have a chance! 
14030,Did your car break down?  I always hate when unexpected things come up.
14031,Ouch.  I bet that was uncomfortable.  
14032,They always give a 4 hour window and either show up late or not at all
14033,Yeah that would make me angry
14034,"I'm sorry to hear that, maybe you'll get the next one!"
14035,Maybe it won't take too long if you work really hard and make your boss happy.
14036,What is your favorite ice cream?
14037,"Oh that is unfortunate, maybe next time"
14038,Oh no.  Did you at least get a severance? Were you able to get another job since?
14039,Well I'm sorry to hear that.  Hopefully something good is right around the corner!
14040,Maybe find another adult with a kid for a play date
14041,Yeah being with other adults can help
14042,A new school year can be a pretty exciting thing.  Is it a new school year for you or your child?
14043,"Highschool was a long time ago for me, but from what I remember I had great times."
14044,I understand I think that's a good thing.
14045,Time to get the spray out.
14046,"yeah, you said that."
14047,Oh I bet.. thats always risky honestly. Did you talk on the phone to someone while walking? 
14048,Holy! Glad you are okay. 
14049,"Oh my gosh, what did you do?"
14050,"I bet, glad you are ok"
14051,oh how cool! I bet you have a very beautiful voice. was there any prize?
14052,good job! maybe you should pursue a singing career :)
14053,lol that's terrible. Did he do stuff like that a lot back then?
14054,You should prank him to get him back.
14055,Sounds fun.  What did you do there?
14056,I have always enjoyed the fair.  Glad you got to go and have a good time.
14057,I am sorry to hear that. Did the storage had insurance?
14058,I understand.The emotional value is inrepleacable
14059,I am glad you are please.  I am guessing you are a fan of Trump.
14060,"Well, she was a bit in shock that she lost I bet.  "
14061,"Yes, I agree. The heat here in Texas is killing me. It was 112 last week!"
14062,"Mine too, love to see the leave change colors and of course be able to wear leggings and uggs!"
14063,Oh no! Was anyone badly injured?
14064,That's terrible. I hope your friend recovers.
14065,What?!? That is awesome. I would be so pumped up. Were you happy for him?
14066,Same here. Maybe he will give you some.
14067,That was really nice of them. Sorry to hear about your mother. 
14068,It was. Time helps.
14069,"Wow, I bet that was a blast from the past."
14070,Sounds like it! It makes me want to go find some of my old stuff.
14071,"Oh that doesn't suprise me. I voted for Hillary, I knew Trump wasn't going to be worth anything. She probably wouldn't have been either though."
14072,God for you.I am sure you are ready to ace that interview.
14073,I am sure you will.
14074,Do you think that we are going to have another 2008 all over again?
14075,What do you think is going to be the cause of this one?
14076,What kind of endeavor are you reffering to?
14077,What about you? Don't you work?
14078,Sounds like a good time.  What kind of truck is it?
14079,My in-laws used to have an old chevy truck I don't remember the year though.
14080,"Oh wow, you bust be lucky! I only see coins haha!"
14081,"Thats amazing, hope you got something yummy! "
14082,Sounds like fun. What kind of fishing did you do? Fly fishing?
14083,I quite fancy sea fishing - I like boats. Did you catch many fish on your trip?
14084,That's pretty nasty. Have you confronted her about it?
14085,That's really inconsiderate of her.
14086,what?? that is so scary! I'm glad you are safe. that's why i always have my gun with me
14087,it sucks that some places don't allow conceal carry! like malls and some other places and that's exactly where those shootings happen
14088,That's great they were able to help you out. Are you doing better now?
14089,"I feel you. We were in a similar situation last year, but things have started looking up."
14090,It is truly horrible. Such incidents mostly happen due to drivers being careless like texting while driving. I hope no deadly casualties had been involved in this event
14091,My condolences to the family of that passed away man. It must be truly hard for them to grasp this whole sudden devastation
14092,Good for you!!! I think its annoying when people act like that about anything.
14093,Yes I hope he wises up some in the future!
14094,Did you end up getting one?
14095,"Nice, where did you go?"
14096,Are you stressed out?
14097,Try and work out or find a new hobby to take your mind off of things
14098,"Oh my, what is the matter?"
14099,I am so sorry to hear that.  What is wrong with him if I may ask?
14100,Try and give them another call to see what the situation is
14101,Keep positive and try and get the answer you need.
14102,Oh! What type? A fun secret or one of those sadder ones? 
14103,Have then be able to? May I ask what the secret is? 
14104,Reasearching papers can be tiresome.  Did it turn out well?
14105,"Then it was worth it, even if it was arduous."
14106,"that is awful, hopefully you can plan another one soon"
14107,"im sorry, thats the worst"
14108,"Oh no, I am so sorry. How long do you have to wait to take it again?"
14109,I remember struggling with that too when I did my test. I was so nervous. 
14110,"Uh oh, that's bad. Did you have insurance for it?"
14111,Oh no! I hope you're able to get it fixed for cheap!
14112,I love vacation time.  Where are you planning on going?
14113,Sounds exciting.  I've never been there.
14114,maybe just take it slow
14115,maybe that was the case
14116,What subject is it in?
14117,Do you anticipate a problem?
14118,That is great for you!
14119,It is lovely to have a friend like that.
14120,That great news.  I don't know how rare it is but in the 14 years I've been married we've seen a lot of other couples suffer with infidelity.
14121,I find faithfulness requires love and effort.  Both together are necessary.
14122,"Agreed, it's a choice made every day."
14123,"I love to hear that, positive stuff! Im glad for you. "
14124,I love when good things happen especially since they usually dont happen often. 
14125,What do you mean? 
14126,"Im sorry to hear that. I think everyone feels that way to a certain degree, even if it is more for some and less for others."
14127,"I understand, that can be hard to deal with! Have you tried anything new regarding what it is that you are self conscious about?"
14128,"Yuck, that would be bad."
14129,No need to look closer at some things.
14130,Are you planning to keep it?
14131,That's fitting at least.
14132,"I understand, maybe things will improve for you!"
14133,Oh no! Are you alright?
14134,I can't either. Hopefully they don't actually cause someone else to wreck.
14135,Have you tried seeking expert help?
14136,hahahahah so you are more worried about your friend than actually fixing the boat?
14137,"Oh my goodness, that's crazy! Do you have home insurance to cover the cost to replace everything?"
14138,"Yeah that's awful, I'm sorry that happened to you. I'm glad you're alright at least! That's a scary thing to happen."
14139,Oh gosh! Are you alright? 
14140,Oh man! I'm so sorry to hear that. 
14141,"dont be nervous, your instructors will not put you in danger"
14142,i cant argue with that lol
14143,"I didn't know the exact timing like that, but it's believable and I know it's harder for the body to use the energy when you eat late."
14144,"Exactly, and since they don't burn the body turns it into fat to burn later or something like that I think."
14145,Oh that sounds like a good deal! It wouldn't get her in trouble or anything right?
14146,Oh okay. Thats up to you! I just wouldn't want my friend to get in trouble!
14147,Oh yeah? When is your friend arriving?
14148,Why are they so sad?
14149,"Hmm, yeah that is a pretty sad thing. Hopefully you can cheer them up a little."
14150,Did you study?
14151,That is great. I'm glad for you!
14152,Well cool!  Were you nervous at all going into it?
14153,So are you going to be going on a roller coaster at a fair for a second time?
14154,Why is it so annoying? Is your friend messaging you all the time or something?
14155,"Oh, well that's not good. Do you actually owe them?"
14156,Nice! Where will you be going?
14157,Well I really hope you two have a great time!
14158,Don't beat yourself up about it. I did the same with my mother all the time when I was in my early teens. We've all been there.
14159,"Oh I agree, I still feel awful about it myself! But I think our parents understand and don't take it to heart, because they usually did the same thing too :)"
14160,It is a gorgeous day where I live too! I'm sorry you don't have anyone to share it with!  Do you have plans later?
14161,I'll be relaxing in my pool later!  You shouldn't let a day go wasted just because you don't have anyone to hang with!
14162,Oh no!  I am sorry to hear that.  Was he suspended?
14163,that is incredible i bet you are really proud
14164,i remember when my daughter did her first steps i was so proud of her
14165,Probably not.  But now I'm interested to know.  What happened?
14166,I can believe it.  It does tend to happen.
14167,Oh god! Did everything turn out well?
14168,I would have been SO scared! I'm glad it all turned out fine though! 
14169,What made you feel strange?
14170,"I am sorry, we all have our moments of wanting to go back in time, I know I do."
14171,"Oh no! I am sorry to hear that, what is going on?"
14172,That would make anyone upset! I am sorry!
14173,That's good you're getting a break! Life is much more rough as an adult than I thought it would be as a kid.
14174,"No kidding! I'm glad things are good for you now - rest, relax, and enjoy!"
14175,Money is always amazing! Good for you. 
14176,Go for the dark chocolate its more expensive but its worth it! 
14177,Are you sad and all alone now?
14178,Maybe you can find a new friend!
14179,"Oh, what a worry that must have been. Did you have to evacuate?"
14180,That must have been awful! Friends in Florida had to evacuate. When they got home their house had feet of mud in it. Did you have much damage to your property?
14181,Oh how fun!!! I bet you had a great time!!! I LOVE county fairs!
14182,That sounds amazing!! I love the old fashioned theme. What was your favorite thing at the fair?
14183,Did they have a live band or was it more of a DJ type thing?
14184,sounds super gross! i bet you were a mess. 
14185,Thats how it usually is then boom fly guts all over your helmet and clothes. 
14186,Where do you like to get your purses?
14187,You sound like a smart and informed shopper.
14188,You can use the left over money on so many other things!
14189,Cool! That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet it will be a blast for you.
14190,It's always great when you can afford to get what you like. Good for you! I'm sure you deserve it!
14191,How far away is she ?
14192,"Well, that was nice ."
14193,That is a good feeling. What has changed?
14194,That is so awesome! Congrats!
14195,How old was your doggy?
14196,Did she have a disease?
14197,Oh yeah what kind of boat?
14198,Sounds super cool im happy for you 
14199,Oh no! I am so sorry!! I hate when something liek that happens. No one was injured?
14200,"Well, I am glad no one was injured!!! Its a shame to lose great kitchenware though!! I hope you will be able to find a suitable replacement!"
14201,Oh my gosh. You must have been horrified. I can't even imagine.
14202,"Thank goodness you are ok though. That could have been really, really bad."
14203,That's good news.  Did they have a good track record for sales in past jobs?
14204,Hope it all works out for you.  Selling cars can also be a stresfull job.
14205,What!! That's awful oh my my goodness that's really pathetic 
14206,Exactly how can you go there not being able to trust your coworkers 
14207,"NOOOO! I've been there, and I feel your pain! What kind were you trying to get?"
14208,That sounds delicious and I'm going to have to try that! My personal favorite is Ben & Jerry's Phish Food. Now I want some.
14209,"Oh, really? What happened to you?"
14210,"Wow, that's pretty scary! Glad there was a good Samaritan around to warn you!"
14211,Oh my that's a big problem. What did you do?
14212,That's good! But also was wondering what is a livid?
14213,"Oh, :D"
14214,Well good for you.  What did you do to prepare yourself?
14215,Well good.  Did you get the job?!
14216,Thats awesome news congrats! 
14217,even better honestly then you didnt have to deal with the stress of trying and it just came natural! 
14218,Is it the first day of school for them?
14219,Summer breaks seem to be getting shorter each year.  Hope they had a good day as well.
14220,"Okay, but probably not a good idea in the long run."
14221,"Hopefully, you've got a new friend."
14222,Sounds like a fun time! What did you guys do? 
14223,glad you guys got to spend some fun fam time together 
14224,I would be so excited! 
14225,Hopefully everything goes really well for you and happy birthday! 
14226,"Wait, what?! That's unbelievable! Why?"
14227,"Riiiight...that's a stupid lie if I've ever heard one. Fight this if you can! After 10 years, they should be promoting you if anything."
14228,That was smart to get a used one. I hope you got a good deal on it.
14229,I think most of the time when people sell children's items you're pretty safe. And you can google to make sure of it too.
14230,"That's freakin awesome! I never win anything, go you! What band is it?"
14231,"I love them!!! So jealous, hope you have a blast!"
14232,"Aww, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a new hobby for the weekends."
14233,I definitely understand. It really sucks that you're so limited. 
14234,Im so sorry to hear that. What is wrong with him?
14235,That sounds oddly crazy and wild. Reminds me of rabies? I hope you make his last days his best and glad he wont be suffering anymore.
14236,That is wonderful!  They must be so happy and relieved also to not have to pay!  
14237,Oh good. I was going to ask how you felt about it.  Are you in college?
14238,"thats awesome, good for you"
14239,"well that is great, very hard thing to accomplish"
14240,Strange place for something to surprise you. What happened?
14241,"Eek, I'm with Indiana Jones on this one. I hate snakes. Hope you weren't bit!"
14242,"oh wow, i hate when people record those type of videos. It's really not funny to me and very inconsiderate of that person! How embrassing!"
14243,hahaha pay back is the sweetest revenge sometimes 
14244,That is crazy! That must seem to fly by.
14245,"Yeah that must be very strange. I do not have any children, but I can imagine how crazy that is to watch them grow up!"
14246,"Wow, I didn't know that! Did you have a good time?"
14247,That's wonderful! I am so glad that you had a good time. Maybe I will visit there one day.
14248,"I'm sorry to hear that, I hope your luck changes up soon!"
14249,"Wow, that sounds really fun! I've never been on a cruise! How long will it be for?"
14250,"Neither have I, and that's on my bucket list! So jealous! I hope you have an awesome time!"
14251,Well that's exciting! A fresh start is always fun. What inspired you to make such a big change?
14252,"Awesome, you'll be able to make friends at work. I wish you the best in your new city, congrats!"
14253,"Aw man, kids can be SO lazy and don't like to do what they're supposed to. Have you tried a rewards system to get them to do what they have to, or are they too old for that?"
14254,"YES. I say make them do it. Maybe take away phones, etc. if they don't get it together. No excuses for that!"
14255,Oh no how terrible. Was anyone hurt?
14256,"I bet, I would be too. Did you stop and talk to the police?"
14257,"Aww, that must be kinda hard on you."
14258,"I've definitely been there, my husband is in the military so he's away often. I find it's helpful to stay busy, trying new hobbies help!"
14259,Oh no. I'm sorry to hear you are going through a rough patch.
14260,That really does help. I hope you make it through!
14261,I am so sorry to hear that! Have you already filed for unemployment?
14262,"If you do a Google search for your state + unemployment you should be able to find resources and might be able to file online. I'm sorry again, that's tough."
14263,thats a big accomplishment
14264,yea thats fair
14265,"Oh no, is your cat okay?"
14266,"I can understand that, anytime I smell or see vomit I want to vomit too."
14267,Eew! My neighbor's cat used to puke on my bed - coughing up a furball.
14268,Not surprised - I've felt like that too. Did you manage to get it cleaned up ok?
14269,That sounds so awesome! And fun!
14270,Did you ask her to kindly stop? 
14271,She may not be the best choice of a friend if she likes annoying you so much.  Maybe try distancing yourself from her for a while.
14272,Oh cool!  What would that be?
14273,Aw I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll get something you want eventually though!
14274,That's good. As long as at gets you where you need to go. That's what matters.
14275,Same here.
14276,lol that is impressive
14277,lol I bet
14278,did you retaliate?
14279,"Haha!  That's hilarious from my perspective, but must have been embarrassing for you!  What did you do?"
14280,I happens to all of us at least once in our lives!
14281,Oh wow!  I remember the commercials too!  He looked like the coolest toy out there!  Did your daughter like it?
14282,"I guess its true, everything comes back around in style and toys and things.  That would make a fun Christmas gift! (Then you could play with it too! ha ha)"
14283,Bet you're tired. What's the speech for/about?
14284,"Ah okay, doesn't sound fun. Hope you did well and everything went smoothly!"
14285,That sounds like a lot of fun! Have you been practicing for a long time? I'm too much of a klutz to be able to do that so I respect you for it.
14286,That's really cool. Hope you have a lot of fun!
14287,That's a real bummer. I bet you were pretty ticked off.
14288,"Yeah, I've had that happen to me before. Some bags are cheap and fall apart."
14289,Scary!!! What was it?  Were you terrified or just curious?
14290,I would be too!  Did you try to see if you could see someone from another window or just run back to bed?  I'm glad you're ok!
14291,"There are a lot of people allergic to shellfish. That's a bummer though, lobster is good."
14292,Oh no that is terrible. How did you find out it had lobster in it?
14293,"That's awesome, animals are the best! What kind, and is it a boy or girl?"
14294,"Aw, that's a great friend right there. Congrats on your new puppy!"
14295,thats a bummer! do you not have a case on it?
14296,"thats good, make sure to get a case too!"
14297,"How do you mean? I guess it depends on the lady, does it not?"
14298,"Oh, I am so sorry - that is an awful thing to happen. But please don't think all women are like that; many are loving and loyal."
14299,I am very sorry! That is very frustrating! Can you speak with a supervisor about the situation?
14300,"I don't blame you, I would talk to him. Even if he is uninvolved, it is not fair for you to bear the full weight of the tasks at hand. I sure hope he has a solution and the work load eases!"
14301,"Oh, I bet that did irritate you! It's bad enough moving, but you don't need your furniture falling apart on you."
14302,"Yes, and possible it just had too much stuff on it. But, you're right, sometimes it's cheap wood they use."
14303,were you scared?
14304,I would be scared too.  It is cool that you were brave enough to try though.
14305,"Oh no, that's always really stressful. Just do your best to prepare, and try not to worry about it. Whatever happens, happens, and if you're less stressed you'll probably do better."
14306,"No problem, and I'll send good vibes your way that you pass! Good luck, you've got this."
14307,"ohh, gosh. What happened?"
14308,"ohh that's bad. You seem struggling to provide food for your kids. I will pray for you, and wish you a good luck in future. But, don't shoplift again, otherwise you will get into trouble"
14309,That was so nice. What kind?
14310,Carrot cake is wonderful!
14311,"Thats awesome, I hope you win! What are you playing?"
14312,I bet you will do great!! It sounds like you have been practicing very hard and you have the desire. That is a winning combination!!
14313,"That sounds like a nice memory, but we all grow old. Do you still spend time with them sometimes?"
14314,"Yeah I agree. I have a little one myself, and I kind of with they stay that young forever."
14315,That sounds very exciting. I am sure you will have a great time.
14316,Those sound like fun activities. I hope you take lots of pictures so you can remember the trip.
14317,That sounds fun. Was it a scary movie?
14318,Oh okay. Did you watch it all alone?
14319,What made you suspect that it might rain?
14320,It's good that you thought ahead.
14321,I hate to hear that! I hope everything goes well and you get better news than you are expecting.
14322,"I always try to do things to avoid thinking about things like that, maybe you could do the same!"
14323,That sounds fun! But what is cornhole? I've never heard of it before!
14324,Okay interesting. I'd like to try is some time!
14325,"Oh, man!  That is my nightmare!  You must have been so worried!  Are you OK?"
14326,I would imagine!  That is great news!  I am sure you had a nice sigh of relief!
14327,Ugh that is so annoying! Have you confronted him about it yet? 
14328,Wow what a jerk...sorry you have to deal with that. I hope you can resolve that situation somehow.
14329,"you should take the docs advise and get your health under control though, its important!"
14330,good i hope you do well and stick to it!
14331,"I would be so embarrassed. I would have probably done the same thing, but I would feel so guilty."
14332,"Yeah, that's what I would probably do also. It probably won't even be that big a deal in the end."
14333,That is great!  What a nice parent!  You must be pumped!  You should do something nice for her to show your appreciation!
14334,That is a great idea!  Cruises are amazing.  You all will have a great time!
14335,I'm so sorry.  What kind of t
14336,Oh wow.  I bet that was really hard.  Hopefully next time you will win
14337,thats awesome! what was the charity?
14338,"That is kind, when i have the means i try to donate"
14339,"ohh, that's great! Now he's ready to learn life lessons. ha ha!"
14340,"Ha ha! Don't be annoyed, that's what children do! believe me!"
14341,That is a wonderful attitude to have!  Being content and happy with your life is so important!
14342,Most people always complain about what they don't have and never stop to appreciate what they do have.
14343,That sounds like a lot of fun. I have always wanted to go to one of those shows.
14344,I like how colorful the whole production is. It really does look amazing.
14345,ohh that's bad. What happened?
14346,I feel you. That happens with me every time.
14347,"Oh my, what happened to cause this?"
14348,"sheesh, i'm sorry about that sharting is the worst"
14349,Omg congrats :D
14350,"Yeah at first it might feel a little lonely, but it'll be nice to have some relaxation time, right? "
14351,That would be nice. We need some rain too. 
14352,Thanks! Enjoy your rain!
14353,"that terrifying, i am scared to death of hurricanes"
14354,that is understandable! were you effected by harvey?
14355,That's a real bummer. I am sure they benefited from your coaching even if they didn't win in the playoffs.
14356,It must be satisfying to see the improvements of your pitchers. You are really helping their careers.
14357,"Cats eat everything, they are not humans"
14358,The buy yourself the food
14359,"Oh well, you cant go back and change it now"
14360,"Im just saying, dont feel bad I highly doubt your one vote would have been a tie breaker anyhow."
14361,"That is good, what do you find good about the economy?"
14362,Do you think the unemployment rate is going down? 
14363,im sorry about that! Did your son start school already?
14364,Thats great. Thats good to hear
14365,That is nice to hear. I hope they really like each other.
14366,Yeah well you will find someone one day. Just be patient!
14367,Ohh! that's so awkward! What happened then?
14368,Yes! Maybe you should set a reminder next time! ha ha!
14369,I'm sure it's hard waiting for the new releases when it's a game your hyped up for! I enjoy playing games too!
14370,"I enjoy RPG games the best. So, I really liked Fable, Halo, Sims, Assassin's Creed, etc."
14371,That is so true. I agree with you
14372,"Yeah, people tend to have some harsh reviews on things and that could be troubling"
14373,"whoa yeah thats awful, i wouldnt either"
14374,"i agree 100%, you make a commitment , should stick too it"
14375,I stop playing videogames years ago
14376,I prefer to read books on my free time because I am grown up
14377,"Well, he is probably lying."
14378,"Elvis only had a daugther, so the chances of him telling the true are slim"
14379,The economy is cyclical so it is bound to happen eventually.
14380,Well the last time the economy was bad we had a different president. It is hard to say why recessions happen.
14381,That is very true! They are very good
14382,I am! They are my favorite team!
14383,I am sorry to hear that! I hope your dog gets better
14384,Thats good! I will be praying for you and him
14385,Agree 100% it makes me want to adopt all the pets! Have you ever rescued an animal?
14386,That's amazing. I have a rescue myself and I will never have a pet any other way.
14387,Yes they are. I live in Oklahoma and we deal with them all the time. I have seen some really bad ones.
14388,One year we had one hit a school in Moore and a few children died. It was so devastating. I hate tornados so much.
14389,That is very impressive! my brother in law is starting his senior year as well
14390,"Certainly, does she have a college in mind?"
14391,"Ha, you'll have to enlighten me as I don't know much about the Chargers. Are they usually not a good team or what?"
14392,That's unfortunate. How do things look for this upcoming season?
14393,Thats wonderful! Congrats
14394,Well that is wonderful! I would be proud as well
14395,That's awesome. Was this the first year this particular team was together?
14396,"Gotcha. Why low expectations, did you not do well last year?"
14397,That is awesome. I bet you really helped him develop his talent.
14398,You have made a big difference. Glad you are making a difference.
14399,"thats a horrible feeling, especially something sentimental "
14400,i hope like crazy you find it!!
14401,"lol thats tough to deal with, have you asked if she has any friends?"
14402,ah dang dude thats kind of cold hearted
14403,I understand that. I bet you miss them a lot.
14404,Yeah it is rough at that age to be apart. At least you can Skype and keep in touch.
14405,"that is rude of them, they should at least wave a thank you or something"
14406,Yeah i always to make sure to thank the people that do ncie things for me
14407,I'm sorry I don't know who that is. Was he famous?
14408,"Oh. Sounds like a big loss for Blackhawks fans, that sucks."
14409,"That is a huge moment in a kid's life! I would be too, congratulations "
14410,"I do not at the moment, but I plan to at least when I turn 35 years old"
14411,"oh man thats terrible, thats a horrible feeling! "
14412,At least everyone was still at work and you werent left there alone!
14413,"that is awesome, i bet it took a lot of hard work to accomplish"
14414,Yeah i remember a long time friend went there and it was such a pain to be able to get accepted
14415,That's awesome! What sport is the team for?
14416,"Wow, congratulations! That is a pretty competitive league as well"
14417,"i am too, i think we are headed in a better direction!"
14418,"i hope so, we are def the greatest nation in the world"
14419,"Congratulations, always nice to have a new addition to the family!"
14420,That is always the biggest worry when having kids and I'm happy it worked out for you guys.
14421,"a great family makes all the difference, and can get you through anything"
14422,i am also grateful to have a caring family that means the world to me
14423,That is so great that you're cooking for her!  Did she love it?
14424,Oh good!  You must be so proud too!  I love watching youtube recipes!  I'm so glad it turned out for you!
14425,You must be the luckiest girl on earth
14426,Congratulations girl :)
14427,That sounds like a lot of fun! Is it hard to ride a mule? I've always heard they are stubborn.
14428,"Huh, well I will definitely have to try that some time. I've always wanted to ride a mule!"
14429,"That's neat, whats the tournament for?"
14430,I love cornhole! I used to play that all the time when I tailgated in college. Good luck!
14431,i didnt either! i though germany would repeat
14432,"the final match was really entertaining too, the whole cup was good!"
14433,Why would they take it off air? it was a great show
14434,that is not cool do you think it will ever come back?
14435,Oh no. That really stinks! I know how that feels. We like the Red Sox here.
14436,"They are having a good season, but have had many bad ones. Boo Yankees!"
14437,That is so exciting! I bet you can't wait to spend time with her!
14438,"I know, I feel the same way when my wife is gone. "
14439,Nice!  Nothing better than driving a smooth new car!  What kind did you get?
14440,"Noice! Ha ha, that's so funny.  I have a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee.....I bet its like night and day! Take that baby out and ride it with the windows down and the music up!"
14441,That is exciting! I hope everything goes well.
14442,I have two boys myself! I feel like two kids is the perfect amount. Not too much to drive you insane and just enough so your first isn't lonely.
14443,"Wow, how nice. Is she always doing nice things?"
14444,"Wow, you are lucky to have someone like that in your life. That's rare."
14445,"that is awesome i am really proud, college is really important for your future"
14446,"im sure you will find something you like, eventually"
14447,lol some free time! what grades?
14448,thats awesome! i hope they have a great year
14449,im sure! its tough being at home all day without alot of interaction
14450,Yes they are. It's a shame how dry it is.
14451,Yes that is what it's like in my area too.
14452,I have heard about that game. Is it a role playing game?
14453,Oh cool. I should check it out. I like those kinds of game.
14454,"oh my goodness, i would freak if my dog ran out, he is like another child of ours"
14455,"that is great, its nice to have someone that is so helpful around "
14456,"That is crazy, does your boss not care?"
14457,"You could just start going in late everyday as well, to make a point to her."
14458,i wish i could stay up late and just watch tv alone some times. i don't have any alone time.
14459,yup.
14460,I love winter and wearing sweaters and jeans. This summer heat is too much!
14461,I live in the south but I'm from the north and that's one think I miss is the cooler weather. I definitely dread the summer as well.
14462,You are more trusting then I am. I don't even trust my wife in my car.
14463,That's very nice of you. Maybe I can learn from you and be more trusting.
14464,"that is not good, did you manage to get it done somewhere eles?"
14465,that is not good i really hope you can get it done on friday
14466,Oh the new one comes out on Friday? I used to play it back in college a bit with my roommates.
14467,Wow you are a dedicated player. I'd imagine you will do awesome online then.
14468,"great health and being well off is a blessing, i too am grateful for tha"
14469,i agree! its refreshing to hear someone with a good outlook on life
14470,i live in a small town too. i grew up in a big city so the change is very welcome
14471,small town country life is much more my speed
14472,"I can relate to that, the late night anxiety of the unknown. Hate that."
14473,"It always seems to wait til your head hits the pillow, then BAM!"
14474,oh no. is she alright?
14475,so she probably had scar tissue. i hope this one goes better for her.
14476,"i imagine so, especially when you have no idea what to expect"
14477,lol what country are you in?
14478,"Oh man, did you put your socks on after you put your boots on? That must of been awkward getting your socks dirty. "
14479,"For sure, that is a motto to live by! I wouldn't dream of doing anything different. "
14480,I can relate. I wish I still enjoyed them as much as I did way back then. Now I'm either out of place of it's a ghost town.
14481,I live in a very large city on the east coast. We have one mall here called The King of Prussia Mall. It's the 2nd largest in the USA. Any time you go it's packed but if you drive 15 minutes to any of the other malls around it they are sad. Half the stores closed and no people.
14482,"Heck yeah! I myself have never been into madden, more of a NBA2k guy."
14483,"I've been playing it since I was a kid, but I always wait like 3 years in between buying them."
14484,"that is a great feeling, what are you pusuing?"
14485,"man thats awesome, i have a friend who is in that field and its very interesting"
14486,"i understand that for sure, finishing a task is a great feeling"
14487,congrats! was it for college?
14488,Yes I love them they deserve to win
14489,But don't forget that the yankees are super good 
14490,oh no! we went through the same thing last december
14491,"i know thats right, i dont know how they survived without electric"
14492,"Congratulations, looks like you guys will be saving a lot of money from no more diapers."
14493,"Haha, you can't always be 100% accurate when you first pursue a goal!"
14494,"i know the feeling, it makes you wish time would slow down"
14495,"thats right, going through the same feeling with my son"
14496,"I don't have any kids, but I can only imagine.  It even seems like I'm growing old fast."
14497,Did it scare you or did you make a new friend? It happened to me a few years ago and it turns out the dog just needed a friend. 
14498,Go over when your neighbor is home and make friends with the dog. Take him a ball or a treat. If it happen again you know your safe.
14499,that's great! what a good husband
14500,I dont mind laundry as long as i dont have to cook!
14501,that's great. it stinkswhen you have to worry about customer service giving you a hard time
14502,exactly. some companies really try to go above and beyond
14503,"It must feel lonely, for sure, but maybe they cope with it in different ways."
14504,"Yeah, it is quite sad knowing there are some people who have literally no one."
14505,why is that buddy
14506,I'm glad she changed. At least now you guys can save money on food because it's cheaper to cook 
14507,Oh ok. Well that's awesome. What did you guys do?
14508,What country are you living in?
14509,How interesting. Do you move for your job?
14510,Oh that's a great habit to have. Did you go to the gym?
14511,Wow that's a great accomplishment! I need to get back to the gym too.
14512,I don't think I have ever remembered a single friends birthday until facebook was created.
14513,"That is true, were they upset?"
14514,"Probably, you just have to remember next year! "
14515,You are very trusting. I'd just assume give my kidney to someone as 10k.
14516,Your better then I am. I hope you don't learn a lesson the expensive way. 
14517,Who is carrying them out?
14518,"Sounds horrible, do you think they'll get caught?"
14519,That's cool. I bet it brought back memories of your mom in the kitchen using it!
14520,"I'm guessing she was either busy, or didn't like to cook? I can relate!"
14521,Oh 
14522,"sorry, i accidentally sent that first message early.  that is great that she is going back to school.  I bet you are so proud of her"
14523,Yeah that is pretty tough. Especially when you really like to work together.
14524,Then you have to meet their replacement and try to get to know them better. It usually isn't the same.
14525,"You must be a good cookie chef! Don't feel too bad, they should have been quicker!"
14526,"Oh, you're sly! Call the cookie addiction hotline quick!"
14527,"always great to see people youve been away from, happy early birthday!"
14528,lol no doubt! i got to see a bunch of friends recently at a wedding it was nice
14529,"For vacation? And yeah, the rates are pretty high, hopefully you won't be in those areas."
14530,"That's awesome, I bet it'll be in a nice secluded resort!"
14531,i grew up in miami so i know how you feel
14532,i know what you mean. i lived thru hurricane andrew and it was traumatizing
14533,I'm sorry to hear that. Is it drugs or alcohol?
14534,"Oh my! I thought the wrong thing. I'm so sorry to hear that, I hope he is okay!"
14535,What did you drink specifically? 
14536,Did you eat anything?
14537,I agree. I wish all the countries would get along. No need to be mean to each other.
14538,Also I think all the countries should allow foreigners to visit. I don't understand why they are so territorial.
14539,that is intense! what was it?
14540,"ahh dang, thats terrible! that is pretty bad luck"
14541,Did she take care of a bunch of dying kids?
14542,"That is good, it is nice to have a woman like that"
14543,What school did you go to?
14544,Wow!  I'm from that area and love the Buckeyes too!
14545,Why not?  How can you not be happy with a 6-pack?
14546,"That's insane, I hope you plan on returning that ASAP!"
14547,thats insane!! were you able to get in? and what concert?
14548,shoot thats a bummer! hopefully they will make it up to you
14549,Seriously.  I was looking it up the other day thinking about moving somewhere else and that state was even worse.  Then to read about everything that makes the crime rate is overwhelmingly scary.
14550,"I know, it really makes you leery of everyone around you.  There are still some good people in the world though.  I'm one of them! :)"
14551,Wow that is very far away. Do you get to visit often?
14552,Yeah that is a bummer. Maybe one day you will live closer together.
14553,that happened to me once i almost died. my heart was racing and then boom out pops my cat.
14554,but what if it's just some air or something
14555,What was the subject?
14556,I'd imagine it's tough
14557,That is good that you have something to protect yourself with
14558,"i completly agree, specially with the crazy people there is these days"
14559,Did they choose to switch themselves or was it out of their control?
14560,Well maybe you guys can hang out outside of work?
14561,That's great!  Sounds like he's a smart kid!
14562,"That's awesome, just keep him on the right path and he'll be the next Elon Musk!"
14563,That would be good. There is so much vitriol happening in society these days.
14564,I wish people would just get along. Stop fighting each other.
14565,It is really eating me up inside. I will make sure to pay it back with my next paycheck.
14566,who got in?
14567,you mean the men of the underworld?
14568,"Ok, who is competing you?"
14569,"Nice, will check it up, i love indoor athletics as well"
14570,"Aw, I'm sorry, why can't you?"
14571,"I'm with you on that one, especially if it requires flying. No way can I afford that."
14572,i grew up with hurricanes and those are terrifying i can imagine tornados
14573,exactly. are you in the usa?
14574,Wow the trifecta! Congratulations on that!
14575,"Right, I think you are in for a rowdy time for sure!"
14576,I never liked those either.  Do you have any health problems that would make you dread it?  
14577,Don't sweat it.  You'll do great.  Its never a fun process but that's so good you're keeping up with your health!
14578,Do you at least get to ride in it with him?
14579,"Yeah, it's always better to get motivated rather than jealous! Use it as motivation to save more money."
14580,That is awesome. It's nice how social media can reconnect people.
14581,I think it has its purpose. It makes it easier to find people you lost touch with.
14582,"Oh trust me, there's nothing to be jealous about! The heat is KILLER where I live."
14583,I live in central Louisiana in the US. Our winters never really get THAT cold. I'd say coldest is 25 degrees Fahrenheit.
14584,"That's always scary, the plane starts shaking and you immediately think ""We're going down!"""
14585,"I bet your anxiety was through the roof, I've flown a lot and still that freaks me out."
14586,Do you not see them much?
14587,I can relate. I last seen my mom around 8 years ago and my dad around 10 years ago. Maybe you should move closer to them.
14588,oh no. that is horrible
14589,oh goodness i know right
14590,"That's awesome, what did you do to take advantage of it?"
14591,"That's great, nothing beats the farmer's market."
14592,Wow that is interesting. Did you win the case?
14593,"Great job! I would have laughed as well. Great technique to prove your point, it is always good when you can get emotion from the judge "
14594,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear about this, may his soul rest in peace"
14595,May his soul rest in peace and his memories live on
14596,Well it was there for you. If someone else wanted it they would have been there first!
14597,You are very thoughtful. I am sure he understands a chocolate craving is never to be denied!
14598,That is wonderful!  That is a difficult instrument to master.  Was he nervous beforehand?
14599,What a wonderful moment!  Does he want to try to take it professional and be in an orchestra or does he not know yet?
14600,oh no. is everything ok?
14601,did you?
14602,i would get someone to look at it if possible to avoid any disasters
14603,Sounds like a productive evening! What did you cook?
14604,sounds more healthy than the chic-fil-a that I had!
14605,"i do too, flying is kinda nervewracking "
14606,oh yes definitely
14607,That is amazing! I bet you're excited
14608,That stinks but I guess the law is the law. Are you going to fight it?
14609,I know how that feels but I guess they have to pick someone and it was just your bad luck day. It can always be worse.
14610,What kind of practice is it? That takes a lot of guts!
14611,"Not literally of course, lol. Good for her, I am sure she will do fine!"
14612,Does it make you feel good to at least think about those times though?
14613,Yeah life comes at you fast.
14614,oh my god i'm so sorry. i've only got one grandparent left and it's tough to even imagine not having her
14615,i do. i'm so sorry you are having such a hard time. may you find peace in her memories.
14616,That is always a wonderful feeling to be prepared and ready to go.  Are you a morning person?
14617,I can understand that.  Such a great idea before the chaos of it all.  Its important to do things like that your ourselves!
14618,You shouldn't be jealous. There is no need for that
14619,Well that is ridiculous. Im sorry
14620,Did you have to take a test?
14621,That's good. If it's like mine-you had to wait forever!
14622,Why did that happen
14623,That does suck
14624,What happened
14625,That's nice. Is he enjoying retirement
14626,That's great. I hope to retire some day.
14627,Do you feel like that helps or hinders your personal life?
14628,I can relate I like to keep work at work but as an adult you spend so much time at work it's hard to meet people other places.
14629,"How beautiful! They are so much bigger when I see them than I think they are going to be.  My parents house has some land and when I bring my kids over there, we can see the young bucks eating the grass in their backyard.  "
14630,Yes!  They're legs are so much longer than I thought and they hope over they're 8 foot tall privacy fence like its nothing!
14631,that is amazing. children can amazing you if you give them the opportunity
14632,it's crazy the things they are learning now. it makes you feel like a dummy 
14633,Are there any other types of seafood you like?
14634,That is very sad
14635,I am sure he did
14636,Get ready to wait for a long time. DMVs are terrible.
14637,Some allow you to make an appointment. You should try that.
14638,"Well, that's fun! I bet you are really excited about it."
14639,"Oh, front row tickets make it even better! Have a great time."
14640,"Oh no, I think I know where this is going. How did she manage as a waitress?"
14641,"Haha oh boy! Well, on the bright side I'm sure that's a mistake she'll only make once. We all have to learn."
14642,One of the many reasons I'm glad to have hardwood!
14643,How have they changed the most? 
14644,What do they do now? 
14645,Did you end up washing dishes.
14646,Was he upset about it?
14647,a what?
14648,oh i thought he wanted a baby.. dump him first
14649,Actually my aunt is afraid of them also. She said as a girl one cornered her and wanted to hurt her. Why are you scared of them? 
14650,Strange. Next time you have them try them cooked in goose liver fat and scotch. AMAZING!
14651,Im sorry about that. Dont be nervous though. He is a loyal person I bet
14652,What is the name of the company?
14653,Were you worried at all about the cost of raising them?
14654,"Yeah, I'd imagine"
14655,"Nice, what team is that you are rooting for?"
14656,"No, I really dont follow sports much."
14657,college? 
14658,oh wow thats great.  
14659,I have never been camping.
14660,"That's really nice, we don't get a lot of that these days. Makes me kind of miss the old days when people had a real sense of community."
14661,I totally know what you mean. I live in a smaller city now and it feels a lot cozier than larger cities I've lived in before.
14662,Why is it torture? 
14663,"Yeah, maybe next time"
14664,That must be pretty lonely. Do you talk often?
14665,Well that should help
14666,Well eep it up and visit when you can
14667,how come?
14668,haha oh no.
14669,i bet he appreciated that at least
14670,at least it didn't turn into one of those cheesy 80's movies
14671,Sweet!
14672,What kkind did you get?
14673,I have always had hp. I do have an ipad though
14674,Wow that's great! How old is he?
14675,That's wonderful to see that kind of progress. You must be very proud.
14676,That's nice of you. Is it a small dog or large?
14677,Did it make you want one of your own?
14678,"Why, what is happening on Monday?"
14679,"Those are always stressful, better study hard!"
14680,"That is good, are you married?"
14681,Do you want to have kids in the future?
14682,"That's a bummer, at least it didn't go out in the beginning of summer, I guess."
14683,"Dad's are always life savers.  I love my Dad as well, he has saved me in a couple of occasions."
14684,Yeah it sucks when people just seem to have it all.
14685,Are you the type that's prone to getting sick?
14686,Well that's too bad.  Yeah when you have bad genetics there aren't enough apples to keep the doctor away.
14687,was there a reason why?
14688,maybe it was closed event. you speak to her about it?
14689,OH no! Were they okay?
14690,I bet you were relieved.
14691,Oh no that's horrible. Any idea why?
14692,That's so strange. I'd give the power company a call and see if there wasn't a mistake.
14693,You should find the local cafe or something
14694,You can always google the local hot spots. You've got to get out there. It might not be easy
14695,i used to get screwballs with my sister. those were our favorites  as kids
14696,how awesome. it's fun to remember the good old days
14697,i love sharing memories with my sister
14698,I haven't had pizza ht in forever. They don't deliver in my area
14699,Did you complain?
14700,Well that sucks
14701,what is with the book you are writing? people dont chat like that. yea christmas list
14702,its all good. you are able to write very well. im jealous
14703,"ah, bummer"
14704,"probably, yeah. good luck"
14705,I am sure you will do just fine!
14706,"Absolutely, and if you can start with a game for them too that would help."
14707,"Sorry to hear about that. Is it still working alright, or under warranty?"
14708,"That stinks. Phones are so important these days. People always give others crap about staring at them all day, but it's because they afford us the ability to do so many things. I hope you're able to get another one soon."
14709,Do you feel better now?
14710,That's good It's sucks when you have to take care of yourself when you don't feel well.
14711,I am too
14712,I understand that as well
14713,I can understand that. Everything is right at your doorsteps. 
14714,That can be very rough. Maybe you can move there soon!
14715,That sounds terrible
14716,They are so rude
14717,did you take him to the vet?
14718,oh thats good then.
14719,"Little kids are pretty amazing how they can pick things like that up in the right environment. So nice you are teaching him good manners, those are in short supply in adults these days!"
14720,"Poor little guy. Sounds like he's lucky to have you, especially at such a critical time in his life."
14721,What is it for?
14722,That's pretty cool. I am a Pharmacy Tech
14723,That is so true. That certification was really easy. I was nervous for no reason
14724,You will do great!
14725,THAT must have been a nightmare. How many do you have?
14726,That can be rough. I know I've dealt with that with my kids by giving them each 10 minutes of solo time before they go to bed. Allows them to get their energy out.
14727,"It should work! Let them pick what you do for the 10 minutes, then move to the other one. I've done puzzles, read books, and solve Rubix cubes with mine. Good luck!"
14728,where is he going and for how long?
14729,oh i hope he is safe. i hear there is a lot popping off there right now!
14730,"Wow, that's huge! I wonder if he got sick afterward?"
14731,I bet he did lol! I would have too if I ate that much!
14732,"I am sure you are, it is nice"
14733,That is a great feeling
14734,That is great. When did you take the test?
14735,Was it hard or an easy test?
14736,Congratulations! What are you studying?
14737,"Wow, that subject was always tough for me in school. Good for you!"
14738,Was this at home or at work?
14739,Really? Congratulations! I hope you guys are really happy!
14740,That's always awesome when the kids approve of him! I'm really happy for you guys and wish you the best!
14741,What is happening this weekend?
14742,"Sounds fun, where at?"
14743,those sound like good people to have around
14744,Oh that is a pickle. Congrats on the new love. Why might your parent not approve?
14745,"Ah they had certain expectations, I see. Well, you can't help who you fall in love with. Hopefully they will support you in the future."
14746,"That's great, I hope he enjoy his/her stay"
14747,How long is he staying?
14748,Did you teach him?
14749,Sounds like he's a natural
14750,Something yummy I'm sure. Are you nervous? 
14751,Perhaps some Vino with it?
14752,"Yikes, I'm not sure that will match well with Chicken Parm."
14753,Yeah I know how that feels. I think it is part of growing up.
14754,Kids have aversions to clean rooms. She is not the only one who does that.
14755,I believe in that too. 
14756,Well it think there is a time frame on the bad luck though
14757,Christmas?
14758,OH wow! Congratulations. First one?
14759,"Oh no, what for?"
14760,"I'm sorry, I hope everything goes okay!"
14761,I can imagine! What did you have on the pizza? 
14762,Carbs are great when you haven't had them in a while. You deserved to splurge!
14763,I hear you! Have you tried spraying lemon etc on yourself or eating them? Helps me a lot!
14764,"Yes, it is usually if you h ave acidic blood I think- too much sugar? Try onions, garlic and lemons, generally stops them from biting me. I HATE misquitos."
14765,that doesnt sound good.
14766,"Good, were you always late?"
14767,You meant on time for home. That is good.
14768,I can understand the feeling. What job did he get?
14769,"Oh wow, does he make a lot of money?"
14770,I think the right amount of spanking is OK.  I was spanked as a child and know I deserved it.  Hopefully you didn't take it to far though!
14771,"Don't beat yourself up too much.  Spare the rod, spoil the child.  Your guilt seems to be from what other people might think.  You know if it was necessary or not."
14772,"I still have yet to see it. I hate how hype affects things. I wish you could always get to things before they become really pumped up.I bet if you watch again sometime later, you'll find it a little better."
14773,"I never get too wild into the Marvel movies. Seems like you always know how it's going to end. To me, they're good, not great. And they can get repetitive."
14774,"I get it, I think I'd like to go back and relive the big events. I miss those the most, football games and dances."
14775,"Yeah, there wasn't much to worry about except classes and whatever drama was going around at the time!"
14776,"My girlfriend always likes to wait until the needle is past empty. I never let it get past half-way empty. I don't get how she deals with that stress in her life! And to me, it makes no sense. But I guess she hates spending the money on it, so she waits."
14777,"One time, she actually forgot to turn the car off while pumping gas. She just stuck the thing in, and went inside the shop. I was in the passenger seat... I stopped, looked for a second and thought, ""Wait, can you do that now...?"""
14778,Well that's nice of you to do that for them. I bet they enjoy the treat.
14779,Maybe you could try putting it on a cute bird feeder so it'll be a little easier for them?
14780,They might've taken out a loan they can't afford.
14781,At least it's paid of and you don't have to worry about payments on it.
14782,What's that? Drink?
14783,Bad or Genius? 
14784,Oh that sounds awful. I am sorry you had to see that.
14785,That's good that you can see a positive in that. You must be a very strong person.
14786,"I would be too, I never win those things!"
14787,Very true! Congrats! It's hard to never win
14788,"Yes, I'm sure it makes you anxious. But, no sense in worrying!"
14789,"I know it's probably hard not to worry. But, it really doesn't change the outcome, ya know!"
14790," Cheer up buddy, it's all in the mind"
14791,I believe there must be a good thing that happened these past few years. Count the good ones and block the bad memories out
14792,By being a decent person...I'm not a cheater and could never..I am very monogomous..Why would you get married if you wanted that?
14793,"I think so. Having integrity and good character would stop you from doing that, would you want to be cheated on? You should be honest with your partner..or work on and water your relationship if you don't like it the way it is. Cheating after 10 years would truly make you a terrible person to waste someone elses life for 10 years only to go through such a betrayal."
14794,on purpose?
14795,That's great. How long was he gone?
14796,Wow. Was he hurt at all?
14797,That is a good feeling
14798,I do agree with you
14799,I bet! I am glad you have a good relationship with a sibling! That's rarer nowadays
14800,How far are you guys apart in age?
14801,"That's terrible, I'm sorry to hear that."
14802,I hope she makes it up to you.
14803,"I love shrimp nachos, but any nachos are good really"
14804,What do you put on your nachos?
14805,"Wow, that's really extreme. You should feel bad about it."
14806,What do you need to leave?
14807,How cool is this? I won free ice cream for a year from my local creamery!
14808,It was a raffle!
14809,"I can understand that! I actually attempted a diet about a month ago, and it was miserable. What made you give it up?"
14810,That seems like the best option. It is hard to stick to a diet for a set amount of time. The weight always seems to return.
14811,Did you roll down your window and yell at him?
14812,Gagging? So you don't do that? 
14813,Oh really? Is that your favorite month?
14814,That sounds like a lot of fun! Which mountains?
14815,I love pizza
14816,I am sorry
14817,Its hard to find people to help move.
14818,That's good that your brother helped. My daughter I moved alone.
14819,was he hurt?
14820,oh thats good
14821,Oh no! Did you end up finding out who did it?
14822,I would go to HR about it and let them know. 
14823,Oh no! Your friends didn't offer to buy you a drink or something? I would if I wanted my friend to come
14824,That sounds delicious! How nice of her!
14825,She sounds like it! You're lucky to have such a caring mom!
14826,What is the name of your band?
14827,That's a lot. What kind of music do you play>
14828,Where'd they go?
14829,It takes some getting used especially since you haven't been alone in a while.
14830,What kind of shoes?
14831,Converse go with everything too!
14832,I love the beach. We can only go once a year!
14833,Well. you will get back there.
14834,That is sad. Sometime pets are iirreplaceable.
14835,What was her name?
14836,"I am sorry, that is terrible"
14837,sorry to hear that. what age group
14838,hah.. thats cool
14839,"That would be great.  They don't tell you in advance, you just have to find out when you get the check?"
14840,That's good and bad I guess.  It would probably be nice to be able to plan on it.
14841,"That is nice, the ones I use play the same songs over and over!"
14842,"I agree, and most of the music is older music, too."
14843,"Oh no, that's so awful. Were you able to recover?"
14844,Yea. That would make me cautious as well. I hope nothing like that happens again to you.
14845,I'd be mad too! Do you have any idea who could have stolen it?
14846,"That's terrible. Well you know what they say about karma, they'll get theirs eventually."
14847,Don't go check! lol
14848,Oh lol. Well if you have a weapon keep it near you.
14849,That is definitely a no- no
14850,oh wow! what did they get?
14851,wow camaros are awesom.i just got a new suv
14852,Why he is so much better then the other option. I mean they were all crazy but I can't imagine a regime under Clinton. 
14853,Honestly they are both crazy. It's a sad time when those two were the best we had to offer.
14854,I would hate that
14855,I would too
14856,oh thats sweet. is he paying for insurance too? :)
14857,oh well.. at least you got some wheels.. beats taking the bus or walking
14858,Why do you do that
14859,That is not too bad
14860,I know that feeling
14861,IT is the worst. My landlord take forever to get things fixed.
14862,awesome! What are you studying?
14863,Thats a great career! We need good counselors in schools!
14864,"I am so sorry to hear about your dog, did you rescue her?"
14865,"I bet so, I am glad you were able to save her!"
14866,jesus lord...I hope you kicked her out or left!
14867,She is a (fill in the blank) she cheated and betrayed you and your marriage...she would never win in court after cheating. I am so very sorry. There is nothing like being betrayed by someone you love
14868,Did you call an animal shelter?
14869,Did you give him some food?
14870,OH no! Did every one hear?
14871,That's so bad lol
14872,That's great! I wish mine did but they're dreading their first day back tomorrow.
14873,"Maybe it will, I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!"
14874,oh thats good.. did you get to keep some pictures?
14875,wow that was a good idea
14876,"Oh I am sorry to hear that, but I am sure there might be an even better one out there for you."
14877,"It's a tough, going through the job market in general. Persistence is the key. You'll get one."
14878,I can understand that. It can be quite scary.
14879,That is a long time to not be alone!
14880,Cangratulations!!!!  Is this your first child?
14881,That will be the best Christmas present ever!
14882,"That's never a fun situation, I always bring someone."
14883,Meet somewhere public like a store parking lot.
14884,The entitlement everywhere is terrible! Did you find out who did it?
14885,"Well..you could put a box of something that looked good and put ""don't touch"" and put exploding ink in it- Then you will know ;)"
14886,did you call the cops?
14887,that sucks. karma will come
14888,Oh! Mine broke too this past weekend but I got a new one as it was just a cheap dirt devil. I am glad yours is fixed!
14889,"Yes $200 is expensive. It is always good to fix them if you can, especially for the nicer ones"
14890,Oh man doesn't that just make you want to take a car and run right..... Just kidding.. but yeah that would make my blood boil
14891,"Yes! I agree! I guess a lot of people say 3 strikes and your out, I'm done, but for me, I dont care who you are, I just dont give even second chances to most people!"
14892,I love Christmas
14893,Does everyone live far apart?
14894,I know what you mean because I do it too
14895,hahaha you don't say :)
14896,But now you have a new pet to live with you
14897,Haha I love them. They eat other pest like bugs and mice. Wait until you cat dose that again.
14898,That sounds fun! Do you have a boat or jet skis?
14899,Oh for sure! I love riding jet skis!
14900,That is great to hear.  What is making you so happy?
14901,Great news.  Kids are always an exciting adventure!
14902,That was very nice of her. What did you do with the money?
14903,That is a good use of the 100 bucks. I am sure you will pay it forward at some point.
14904,"Yeah, they're sometimes hard starts to the week. Did anything bad happen to you this monday, or was it just slow-moving? Hopefully things pick up for you."
14905,"Man, that's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can recover. "
14906,"Oh no, I have been there! I hope everything goes okay!"
14907,"Don't worry about it, worrying will only make things worse."
14908,Oh no! Were you home when it happened?
14909,I'm so glad you weren't there but I still hate to hear it. Did they take anything valuable?
14910,I understand.  I don't like bad weather either.
14911,Was it a tornado?
14912,What kind of band
14913,I like that music
14914,Ugh I hate when people do that! Did they even leave a note?
14915,Of course. Well karma will get them one day. At least it wasn't a full on accident where you could've gotten injured.
14916,oh wow.. i call that a win!
14917,I bet it can be easy for that to happen in the spur the moment
14918,"You'll have a shot at it again, I'm sure!"
14919,What is that? A video game?
14920,"No worries, we all have our hobbies!"
14921,aww. i can imagine that its really different now in the house.
14922,i felt the same avout my moms dog when he passed.something was missing in the house.
14923,"I hate that! Where they're probably friendly, but because they're so big, you have no idea what could or would happen, so you get so defensive.."
14924,"My brother has a large lab, although they're pretty sure it has to be part of something else, because it's over a hundred pounds and looks much bigger than a normal lab. She's a sweet dog, has the energy of a puppy though, so she comes tearing at you with speed and you think you're about to die.. But she's just being playful."
14925,I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?
14926,Troubling times do make us extra vulnerable.
14927,Any gf or bf? That would be scary yet wonderful!
14928,I would take someone who would be thrilled about it :)
14929,Oh NO...That should be reserved for the worst prisoners. That hurts!
14930,That's understandable. I bet people have had those stuck in their feet before
14931,Oh no no no no no! Thats no man! If you aren't going to fix it then earn money to hire someone who will!
14932,Yes! I would agree! I feel bad your in that situation!
14933,yea it can really hit hard
14934,"Wow! That takes a lot of schooling, I hope you do too! Is it a good company?"
14935,I have been there before. Sometimes you just need to relax!
14936,"It is, we all need time for ourselves!"
14937,what are you studying?
14938,oh wow that sounds impressive. good luck!
14939,That is awesome! Are you going to celebrate?
14940,How fun! I hope you have a great time!
14941,What kind of game is that
14942,It sounds cool
14943,And what was the verdict?
14944,Hard work goes a long way!
14945,I love days like that! Hopefully you got a chance to play outside?! ;-)
14946,So fantastic that you could take advantage of it -- *and* get to make some memories with your kids!
14947,yes technology is great
14948,yea and now smart phones are everything!
14949,Why did it irk you? was he not suppose to be there?
14950,Have you confronted him about it yet?
14951,Did you not pass?
14952,Awesome! I am happy for you!
14953,Kids are the best
14954,That sounds very nice
14955,"Aw, that's no good, are you going to buy new ones or patch them up?"
14956,"Sorry to hear that, hopefully someone will help you out with that."
14957,Nothing to be ashamed about.  There are lots of people much older that are still into gaming.  If you're really good you could actually make money on it!
14958,"Hahaha.  Nothing says you can't do both.  Work at work, play after work."
14959,"that was really nice of them , they are good co workers "
14960,Thats very heart warming to hear
14961,Sounds like an old coaster they should consider replacing.
14962,That sounds exciting! Are you going to see him for the holidays?
14963,What school are you applying to?
14964,That is a tough school to get into. Best of luck.
14965,That's pretty cool.  How long have you been together in this relationship
14966,Well have a safe flight and make sure you make the most of it!
14967,"Oh, that's...interesting. That does sound like a nice change of plans, not only because Starbucks not seem that fun anyway. Hopefully she returned the favor?"
14968,"Well, hopefully she doesn't keep you waiting for very long, if everything else is right! But maybe be more patient than even you think you need to be in order to play it safe, so she doesn't get scared off, so to speak. Sounds like it will be worth it in the end."
14969,"Why don't you get one then, so cute."
14970,That sucks. I hope that changes in the future for you.
14971,That really stinks. Maybe they will take the hint?
14972,Well that's good!
14973,That's awesome to hear!
14974,That's good news. Congratulations in advance!
14975,That is not your fault
14976,She must have a golden heart
14977,"I hope you have showered her with gifts and appreciation, she deserves it"
14978,"yea, this is a much better time for content"
14979,yea i can see that also
14980,"Hopefully, you won't have to walk when it's dark out again or at least have people to walk with you."
14981,Do you guys still keep in touch with video chats and phone calls?
14982,Thats what helped me when I moved away.  Video chatting makes it feel like youre still there
14983,What is so creepy
14984,I am sure you are finr
14985,"It happens, you can't beat yourself up about it, it was an accident!"
14986,That sucks. Are you going to tell your boss?
14987,Well that's a good attitude
14988,congratulations! that is an awesome achievnment 
14989,that is always a perfect combo!
14990,That is bad. Did you do it on purpose?
14991,Mistake can easily happened. Nothing to worry about.
14992,how was the game!
14993,Why were you impressed
14994,I am not sure it was
14995,"That would have made me sad , poor kitten "
14996,"I love animals , i would feel the same as you"
14997,wow surprise gifts are the best!
14998,what a good friend. I'm glad you had a good birthday
14999,I do as well
15000,What happened then
15001,Is he doing better?
15002,"Well that's good. I bet he appreciated you taking care of him,"
15003,That is sweet and sentimental.
15004,I am happy that you have that to remember him by.
15005,Oh congratulations!
15006,"Oh man, I forgot about Cracker Jacks.  I always looked for the prize"
15007,It always makes me think about baseball when I think of Cracker Jacks
15008,"Oh no, that must have ruined the round!"
15009,Hopefully you got a refund.
15010,I am hoping as well
15011,That would be very nice
15012,sounds like a good friend to have by your side
15013,thats good!
15014,Thats understandable! Just be yourself and Im sure you will do great!
15015,A tip someone gave me once is to make sure to have really good posture as it makes you appear less nervous! Fake it till you make it! Good luck!
15016,"Oh no, that classic prank! I bet that was painful, I've only seen it on movies."
15017,"Haha, wow, that's awesome.  Sort of makes up for him playing that prank on you."
15018,"cheer up buddy, everyone have experienced that at one point or the other"
15019,"no worries buddy, the experience will make you stronger"
15020,"For a test? It's good that your confident, that's key!"
15021,"You'll get the highest grade, I'm sure!"
15022,Oh that's good! Any special reason?
15023,Oh that is wonderful news! Congratulations!
15024,"Making new friends can be tough, is there anyone at work you bond with?"
15025,I am sure that you will meet some new friends@
15026,"That is amazing,  Is there a certain reason she cant swim,  she just never learned?"
15027,was her life jacket fancy?
15028,That must've been terrifying in your dream.
15029,I hope you don't have many of those dreams again.
15030,did you pass?
15031,hard work pays off!
15032,Why were you scared
15033,Wow sounds like you need a new store..haha
15034,Do you wear glasses or do you have 20/20 vision
15035,"Thats good,  Give it some time,  Did everything go good, besides the high and dry?"
15036,"That sounds good, Give it time, she will come around."
15037,"I'm so sorry, are you okay?"
15038,I did see that
15039,He wont win anything
15040,I'll keep my fingers crossed that it's good for you! Is that your favorite food?
15041,I didn't know it was healthy!
15042,Curiousity gets to ya sometimes.
15043,hahaha so why did you watch it?
15044,"that is such a bomber, will you still be able to go on your trip?"
15045,"that's not good at all , have you tried asking for someones car?"
15046,"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that."
15047,I'm sure it was. Did insurace cover what was lost?
15048,"I hope you do, too! I have always hated group work."
15049,"I guess so, I just hate that my grade would depend on someone else's work.. or lack there of."
15050,"That is great, what school did he go to?"
15051,Wow that is a tough school to get into. Did you pay the tuition?
15052,That is so annoying.  I thought they were not supposed to be allowed to call anymore.
15053,"I heard they are based outside of the country and make calls out of reach of the law.  Like I said, ANNOYING!"
15054,im sorry to hear that.. old age?
15055,he lived a long life.
15056,"Oh no, were you able to track it down?"
15057,"Aw sorry to hear that, hope he/she is fine and you'll able to find it."
15058,I bet that was nice
15059,I am so sorry for your loss. How was was he?
15060,"He had a good life, yea?"
15061,Were you scared
15062,It's not good to be jealous of your friends.
15063,I'm glad you made that connection.
15064,Gee that's sucks. Have you tried contacting them?
15065,That's terrible service. I hope you get it resolved soon!
15066,Wow. I guess she really has no care for social constructs.
15067,"it would make me lose my appetite. Oh well, what could you have done?"
15068,Why are you hesitant
15069,Then just tell him no.  If it's meant to be he'll respect it
15070,yes and staying away from addicts is always good as well! Pick a different hobby for sure that's healthy is good!
15071,YES! I used to be very social but I have had enough of that and now I am happy to be at home and at peace :0
15072,What game was it?
15073,Oh that sounds fun! Did you go in person or watch on tv?
15074,That was nice of them
15075,I bet you were
15076,It is good to find some time for ourself to rest.
15077,"That's really rude of them, I guess no one taught them manners."
15078,"Someone else should have looked out for you, though."
15079,That's very sweet to even reach that age and to retire! I hope he gets to do fun things now?
15080,You don't know?
15081,It has been long
15082,I agree. I put a lot of effort into my work and I hate when things are half done.
15083,I am sorry! I have been there before and it is no fun!
15084,Wow thats super exciting.  I hope you do too.  What would you go for?
15085,Very nice.  I think youll get it.  I believe in you
15086,"That's very nice of her, not too many left that would offer to do that for a stranger."
15087,"That's really cool, hope you two become BFFs!"
15088,"Oh no!  im sorry, I have been there before too many times.  Just know everything happens for a reason "
15089,"Good! I try my best to live by that.  Its hard sometimes though,  Life is weird."
15090,Well thats not good
15091,I guess you did
15092,Must've been embarassing.
15093,Were you walking and suddenly tripped on something you didn't see?
15094,"Oh man, how come?"
15095,"Oh that is a bummer, maybe you can around work as it's worth it :)"
15096,Oh no. Did you take out a payday loan?
15097,"I'm sorry to hear that. Well, I hope it's over with soon."
15098,I hear they are good
15099,They are talented for sure
15100,What did your brother do?
15101,That's really nice of him. Sounds like you won the sibling lottery.
15102,Wow that's nice. How was the taste?
15103,"Oh I see! Still, a great gesture to get a cake."
15104,Your roommate is awesome. I'm glad you weren't stranded.
15105,I had horrible roomates. I'm glad you gotta keeper.
15106,"That's creepy, do you think you're in trouble for something or is it someone random?"
15107,"I would do so just as a precaution, can never be too careful!"
15108,"I feel the same way! I mean, my Facebook feed is full of all this garbage."
15109,I actually use a special extension on my browser so I can block certain things like this on my Facebook! You should try it!
15110,"you must be nervous, but im sure you will be fine"
15111,"hahaha that might be a small proble, but nothing to be worried about"
15112,"Dang! I hate when that happens.  It's always the day you don't expect it to happen, it happens."
15113,"That's always a nice alternative, could be worse."
15114,"Oh man, I should do that, too."
15115,That's good. What did you get for preparation?
15116,"Oh, I'm so very sorry! I know it's very hard to lose a loved one, I lost my sister, father, and both sets of grandparents."
15117,"Yes, even though it's part of life, it doesn't make it any better when it happens. I hope it starts to get better for you soon."
15118,Nice where are you headed
15119,"That's pretty awesome :) is it your whole family going, or just you and a significant other"
15120,wow sound serious. you do this everyday?
15121,thats a nice committment you got there. congrats
15122,I would love that car
15123,I am in the same boat
15124,What game will you be going to?
15125,"I love baseball, who is playing in the game you are going to?"
15126,Not a lot of people are loyal. Who is this someone?
15127,Being a punching bag in a relationship is no good. It's a 2 way street. Is your partner doing their part?
15128,That's pretty awesome! I feel my skin jump a bit when I see how much people spend on one day
15129,I feel the same! No use spending that on something that will be eaten either
15130,"Oh, how do you feel about that?"
15131,Are you going to allow it then?
15132,How did they feel about that?
15133,"I can understand not wanting a big wedding, I wish I would have made a different decision.  Good for him."
15134,That is such a noble thing to do.  Do you work with an organization or on your own.
15135,"That makes sense.  Well, you are doing a lot of good."
15136,"Wow, that's great! How old is he?"
15137,"That's great, it can take awhile for boys to get the hang of it all."
15138,That is very lucky
15139,I am glad she did
15140,That's awesome that your dad helped you out with math.
15141,Was? Is he no longer around?
15142,That's so sad! I'm glad you have something to remember him by.
15143,He will always live on through spirit in your heart. I'm sorry for the loss.
15144,"Ah, that's too bad. But exciting at the same time! Do you have a particular car in mind?"
15145,"Yes, I heard the same thing! Cheap on parts too!"
15146,"i would have been as well, going on vacation is really fun. are you going with family?"
15147,"that is really fun place to go with family, i was there last year and really enjoyed it"
15148,Well I hope that it turns out well!
15149,Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Good thinking!
15150,Wow. Sounds like you have a wonderful boss. Sarcasm by the way.
15151,Is he always this way?
15152,Its just a boat
15153,I can get that sometimes
15154,"Seems like a silly thing to be nervous about, unless you're a terrible driver."
15155,"Well, to each their own. They have driving classes if you ever feel like you need them."
15156,That's amazing. What was the meeting about?
15157,You earned it! Good job!
15158,That was nice of her.  How did it come out?
15159,Awesome.  What color is it.  Happy Birthday by the way!
15160,I am with you on that one
15161,I hate it
15162,Congratulations to him. Is he younger or older?
15163,Ah so you're the young one. Do you look up to him?
15164,"You need to induldge every once and awhile, right?"
15165,I heard they can keep you from hitting a pleateu.
15166,Aw sorry to hear that...why is she moving
15167,nice well if you keep in touch everyday maybe it won't feel so far
15168,oh yea? did you try to keep up with him?
15169,ah thats true
15170,That must have been fun! I love dogs. What kind was it?
15171,"Fun, I have a friend who has one of those. They're very playful."
15172,It was? What made it hard specifically? Hopefully nothing too bad happened.
15173,"Yeah, I'm with you. I hate going to especially Walmart, because it's so freaking crowded all the time. It's a hassle getting even the shortest shopping list. But I'm on a budget and it's where I have to go."
15174,Thanks for the awesome tip. I appreciate you trying to think of an alternative for me! I'll give it a look.
15175,"Very true! Maybe a gioter and she needs more minerals, thats what it is a lot."
15176,"yes! Research is a life saver, never just rely on doctors..they almost killed me and many I know. I hope it's not too bad!"
15177,"Almost all my family members have smoked at one point in time. I feel bad for the people that get caught in the addiction, and I wish I could help them quit. Sorry to hear it's such a hassle enough that you had to do it inside."
15178,"Hey, I really hope you do. It was partly why my dad had a stroke and then had health problems the rest of his life. But I'm sure you get that all the time. You have to do it for you, not because of horror stories and all that. I hope you get through it, though."
15179,"Aw, I'm sorry to hear that, is she getting up there in age?"
15180,Hopefully they will diagnose her correctly and she becomes her normal self. Fingers crossed!
15181,Is it working well still
15182,Its nice to have
15183,I'm glad you're getting used to it now.
15184,"Oh yea, the Teslas look pretty amazing!"
15185,Maybe they'll be more affordable and even slicker when you get around to it.
15186,"That's a very supportive family you have.  I'm right there with you on the credit, mine is not too good."
15187,Make sure you tell them you love them when you see them next! :)
15188,Thats super sketchy of him.  I never accept checks from people.  Only cash. just in case
15189,hopefully you will still get the money
15190,I do not like mine as well
15191,That is annoying
15192,I have no idea what kind of ingredients you even put in a mug cake?
15193,Pretty much they have problems in their own lives.
15194,"Yep. If people were truely happy, they wouldn't have time to troll others."
15195,That's awesome. Sounds like you were well prepared for it.
15196,That's great! Congratulations on getting it!
15197,oh thats nice. do you all have plans?
15198,that sounds great.
15199,That sounds fun! Do you have a first date planned?
15200,"Ah okay, good plan. I'm sure she will go out with you. Just don't sound too desperate. "
15201,Wow. Must be a sight for those behind you all this time.
15202,It's ok. I'm sure everyone has their embarassing moments.
15203,That is awesome.  it is great when a schedule works out.
15204,"You know that's right.  I love food, although I just recently became a vegan."
15205,I wish I had a car.
15206,Only if i find the money
15207,I am sure it will
15208,I bet it smells nice
15209,That sucks. Maybe there's a next time?
15210,I hope you'll get another opportunity or even a better one.
15211,How did you do that can you remember the last place you had it? 
15212,I know was it an important sentiment to your family? I hope it comes up eventually.
15213,My brother used to always do that to me.
15214,Family should help as much as possible.
15215,maybe you should try making some again
15216,ah ok
15217,That's awesome. Job hunting can be difficult.
15218,I feel sorry for th 19 people who didn't get it.
15219,I bet it will be okay
15220,It happens to everyone
15221,Have you talked to him about it? Why wouldn't he be able?
15222,"Ah, work always seems to find a way to get in the way."
15223,"Heck yeah! I love the fair, mainly for the food and people watching!"
15224,Yum! Don't forget about the corndogs.
15225,Is it a pretty decent raise?
15226,I'll keep my fingers crossed that it happens for you. I don't think a boss would give a hint like that for no reason!
15227,That's terrible. Did you find your dog?
15228,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find him soon.
15229,who won
15230,ah sounds like the smart move
15231,What i that?!?! i think ive heard the name before maybe.
15232,"I see,  What happened? bad recipe?"
15233,Oh god. That's awful. I guess she never came back?
15234,I hope she was able to fend for herself. I'm sorry she went through that loss.
15235,I wish i could make that type of money!
15236,Money is what runs the world.
15237,Cool congrats I can never win those
15238,Well aren't you the Lucky the Leprechaun...how much have you won so far
15239,That is cool I guess
15240,That is the story of my life.
15241,The weekends are for the boys!
15242,Gotta hate weather like that when you're trying to get somewhere. You ok?
15243,That's good. So many peole just drive faster.
15244,She seems work hard
15245,She's one lucky girl!
15246,How long have you guys been together?
15247,"hopefully you do, and remember the movie trailers and commercials take a while before the actual movie plays"
15248,do you have a date ?
15249,Why? Whats going on this weekend?
15250,Oh my gosh thats exciting.  You're going to have such a fun time.  I love roller coasters
15251,"And if you need to, just close your eyes"
15252,What is happening Friday?
15253,oooh that's exciting!  I hope you get good news on Friday!!  
15254,they must be a really good resturaunt
15255,"those are definitely reasons to keep going back,"
15256,i bet! congrats
15257,that was awesome of you all
15258,Did you end up going out?
15259,I'm so happy for you.
15260,That sounds so gross
15261,It sounds that way
15262,I love sauces like that
15263,I do agree
15264,Oh yum! I love cake! That was nice of her!
15265,Ill bet it was! I hope you thanked her! Cake takes time and effort to make!
15266,That sounds exciting! The hard work will pay off. I've always wanted to camp. Have you done it before?
15267,"Is it just you, or will others be joining you?"
15268,I've really glad you and your do are getting along well. Dogs are mans best friend after all!
15269,Yeah but it is worth it because now you have a loyal and obedient partner. 
15270,Wow. What happened?
15271,That's gotta be embarassing.
15272,"That is awesome, normally it is the opposite!"
15273,Your dog is an angel!
15274,Sounds like a goal to me. Good luck!
15275,You're welcome. Goals is what makes life matters sometimes.
15276,"I'm eating some pepperoni pizza as I'm typing this.. washing it down with some beer, my kind of Tuesday night"
15277,What are your default pizzas.  Mine are Little C's or Dominoes
15278,Was the dog okay
15279,I am glad you did
15280,did they?
15281,That's awesome! you and me can go eat!
15282,Hopefully it is a great place to eat and we enjoy it!
15283,I agree!
15284,Yeah they are horrible
15285,"Reminds me of when I was younger, but I always acted like I liked it to make her happy."
15286,Just make sure you drop the hint in a nice way!
15287,That's a long drive.
15288,Any way for you to maybe go to them next time?
15289,What kind of car is it?
15290,"Nice!  I would secretly be a little envious myself, they are nice cars."
15291,"It will figure itself out, always does"
15292,I am sure it will be
15293,Did find your dog?
15294,what are you going to do with it ?
15295,That is the way to go! Keep it up!
15296,Work is pretty great and makes a bunch of money!
15297,That is crazy
15298,That is funny
15299,That's some dedication!
15300,Good luck! I'm sure you'll do great!
15301,I would have cried for multiple days!
15302,Do you have a new place to eat?
15303,That's no fun. I had a cat that would escape all the time too. Did you get it back?
15304,That's not too bad. I had to pick mine up at the animal shelter. 
15305,I hope you do well
15306,I can tell
15307,That's not cool. Will you get it fixed?
15308,Sounds like a plan.
15309,That is bad
15310,I can imagine
15311,i would have been to. what happened?
15312,"oh, well that happens"
15313,where were his parents?
15314,ah that stinks
15315,Aww!  Maybe it's time to start building yours!
15316,Maybe you should start saving up some extra money so you can make yours better!!
15317,That is a good thing
15318,She sounds amazing
15319,Oh yuck! Sounds like a disgusting experience.
15320,Haha that must have felt a bit satisfying at least. Glad you took care of them.
15321,"Right on, glad to hear it. I hate utility bills and how unexpectedly high they can be. I especially hated living with roommates who didn't mind getting them really high, just for the sake of having it a little cooler."
15322,"I hope it stays that way for you. Luckily I'm in an apartment now where the utilities are included, so I don't have to stress about what it's going to be, or confronting my roommates."
15323,Marriage is a very hard thing.
15324,I like all of my partners too much.
15325,"Ohh yeah, that sounds really good."
15326,"I see, what are you going to do to make sure it doesn't happen again?"
15327,That's terrible! Why did you feel scared?
15328,"Oh no, I always feel the same way. I usually avoid areas like that."
15329,oh thats good that he felt comfortable enough to tell you
15330,thats cool that he was able to come out on his own terms
15331,"That's rad, those are slick looking cars!"
15332,It's time to one up him and get a Porsche!
15333,It is a good thing that you care.
15334,I wish I lived in your fine community.
15335,"Sounds like you prepared well, congratulations! What do you think you got?"
15336,"That's always a good sign.  When you feel good about it, you did well."
15337,oh man! i would also be irate. why the delay?
15338,i hate fight delays
15339,Date them both? Then pick which one you like the most.
15340,you should bite first and take them both home!
15341,That's too bad..you sure it was the milk and not something else?
15342,Can you drink any dairy? Or is that totally off limits
15343,Did you kick him in the shen?
15344,"Okay, maybe punch him in the nose."
15345,Then what happened?
15346,Did you do well
15347,You will do better next time
15348,Did someone punch you?
15349,Maybe someone kicked you in the eye!
15350,I dont believe that
15351,Just dont give up
15352,There is no such things as happy days
15353,Happy days fly away so quickly.
15354,"Oh no, that's terrible! Do you know who did it?"
15355,I hope it's not too expensive to fix!
15356,well thats gross
15357,i can only imagine
15358,That's a real positive spirit!
15359,I like your attitude. 
15360,"Hopefully it's not a big one that would cause serious damage, I assume? Otherwise, I kind of like storms. I like the sound of rain, and the visual aspect. It's the best when you get to fall asleep to them."
15361,"I live near the coast, and we have hurricane scares all the time. For some reason, people love to stay behind and just face the storm. They're fearless and think everything will be okay, even when sometimes it's not. I guess they're just determined to stay by their homes and not abandon them, which I can understand. I'll hope for the best for you!"
15362,"I've never had the guts to do that, even though I've wanted to on multiple occasions. What happened, if you don't mind me asking?"
15363,"That's the worst... So it wasn't even just taste, it was about health.. Dang. I don't know if I could ever go back there again. It'd always be in the back of my mind. Glad you caught it early and didn't go home with too much food poisoning."
15364,that is good.i always loved sports as a kid and did well
15365,it is a great way to learn that.im glad i was able to learn those values.
15366,I agree....were you just looking through some photos or what
15367,smh time flies now that you mention it...I was just going through old fb beach pics of me and an ex I was planning to marry but we fell off and it hits me like a sucker punch every time
15368,Congratulations! what do you do?
15369,Sounds like you have some real talent there.  Keep up the good work.  I bet you'll be famous one day!
15370,what is it worth?
15371,hah thats awesome.. canceled of course.. but awesome
15372,I do not even have a dog
15373,I have always wanted one.
15374,I am glad it was resolved.
15375,I sure hope that happens.
15376,That's awful news! I don't want to sound cruel but at least this could maybe be a period of your life where you can just focus on you and improve a lot of areas of your life. You could look at it like a second chance.
15377,"Yeah, that happened to my roommate recently. I didn't try to give him too much specific advice, because most of it is just useless. I just tried to help him realize the best he can do is be patient, because time makes everything feel better, or at least hurt less."
15378,conrats. what did you get?
15379,oh nice
15380,why what happened?
15381,i would feel the same way
15382,Now I feel bad about talking to you.  Do you mind talking to me?
15383,Who are these people?
15384,Is it your baby.
15385,We will see once the baby comes out and is tested!
15386,"I feel that way every day almost, Did you ever end up doing it?"
15387,What made you so tired??
15388,Did she find out you broke your promise?
15389,It's great that you both were able to work it out.
15390,I love swimming!
15391,No no! Forget those shorts! be you!
15392,Nice. What was the award for?
15393,Sheesh that's heavy.  Sorry to hear that.  Have you talked it over yet or no
15394,Well maybe it's for the best.  Good luck
15395,You are not the only. Nothing to worry about.
15396,I am a guy. Why this question?
15397,That sounds like a fun weekend! Did you go swimming?
15398,That sound fun! I love to eat fresh fish!
15399,Hey that sounds like an awesome day!  
15400,Good for you my friend!  We all need days like that!
15401,"Oh no, poor little thing."
15402,I am so heartbroken thinking about it.  I'm sorry.
15403,Oh WOW!  That is a lot of cakes!!  Will you be able to get it all done?
15404,Well more power to you!  I don't think I could do that in one night - you must be a good baker.
15405,"Man, I'm jealous! I'm still a college student, barely paying rent! And nothing but student loans to look forward to. I probably should have taken your path in life. Not to say you haven't worked very hard for it, because I'm sure you have."
15406,Hey I really appreciate that advice. I need to take it. I'm horrible at setting goals. I just move in a general direction. I need to break things down step by step. We'll see how it goes.
15407,"sorry to hear that, my brother has a drinking problem too, and has kids, i love him but at this point we are more focused on the kids , i tell him if you get locked up who is gonna raise the girls , of course we are but still they need a father "
15408,"all you can do is stay positive , all we can hope is our brothers will one day wake up before its to late "
15409,I never win and i play all the time!
15410,This is very true!
15411,awesome.  When are they coming and for how long?
15412,Thats a long trip.  I hope they have a good time
15413,Right now I am sure is too early!
15414,We are going in December and it is going to be magical.
15415,"UGH thats the worst,  I once ran my car dry of oil..oops."
15416,"I try to get a change every time the sticker says,  thats one thing i dont mind paying for."
15417,I would have cried for years.
15418,Life does throw things at us.
15419,oh awesome.. i couldnt never do that
15420,you should be fine
15421,"Oh man.  I hope he is alright, I would be nervous too"
15422,What?! I would have been livid! Did they compensate you?
15423,ohhhhh maybe turn it into a little vacation
15424,"Oh no! Hey, I wouldn't say a better man. I'm sure you are just fine for someone else. She didn't deserve you."
15425,"Okay, yeah a lot of people seem to have that problem. Maybe you can learn from it for next time."
15426,"So, the women only like you because you have money?"
15427,"Well, on paper you are like a dream catch, no doubt about it."
15428,"Do you mean ""out"" of control"
15429,Yes I'd agree with you. I still think it's hilarious that he's president...didn't think know Republicans had such a scarce lineup
15430,how is it going?
15431,thats the way to be! 
15432,Hey that's awesome!  What kind of job is it?
15433,Oh.  Wait.  What?
15434,It's easy to be intimidated by pretty girls.
15435,"You really don't, I agree."
15436,"Oh my,  do you ever geta  weird feeling when it looks at you?"
15437,That is crazy! maybe its you from the future!
15438,That sound like a lot of fun! Will it be your first time?
15439,That's sounds like a great experience. I hope you enjoy it!
15440,It is so hard to wait.  What console did you get?
15441,That is so awesome.  I hope it gets there before this weekend so you can binge it!
15442,oh no what did you do
15443,damn that stinks
15444,"Wow, was it difficult? do they eat alot."
15445,mmmm delicious
15446,Why? What happened? Is everything okay?
15447,"Yes, loneliness can be quite sad."
15448,Is that a good thing?
15449,Great! That is how it should always be :) 
15450,Ah that's difficult. Maybe you can see if there are any sports teams you can join?
15451,Yeah I know what you mean. I'm in a similar situation right now as well.
15452,"Ouch, I hate it when that happens. Did you say anything to them?"
15453,That's super rude. Hopefully karma will take care of that. 
15454,"no, facebook is the devil!"
15455,yea i guess thats true
15456,Oh sports...I have no idea about this subject. Lakers is basketball right?
15457,Great! Is that your favorite sports team?
15458,Yaya! what are you going to spend it on?
15459,Amazing! i need some luck like that in my life.
15460,Aww dangit!  You might have to hide it better lol
15461,I know right??  Maybe you should buy some bad makeup and let her steal that
15462,I love my little dog too! You are a great owner.
15463,"Yes, animals are our best friends."
15464,"Well it is natural, maybe bad food choice?"
15465,Oh you shouldn't be. Don't eat before church though ;)
15466,god it repaired ?
15467,thats cool.
15468,"Yeah, I wouldn't get too down. Statistically, there's not much of a chance of ever winning."
15469,Yes I agree. I would be amazing to win the lottery.
15470,It's good to always try and think positive.
15471,That is a great attitude to have. It would be nice if more people saw it like that.
15472,Congrats on getting him that far! What did he study?
15473,Thats a great job to have in this world. I bet he is excited to get started working?
15474,Getting out of work is the greatest feeling.
15475,I love to enjoy my free time too.
15476,ah yea ... i can understand that
15477,"Oh my god,  was he a homeless man?"
15478,"Oh my god,  Thats actually crazy"
15479,That sounds so sad.  I'm sorry you aren't feeling happy.  What is going on?
15480,Where did he go?
15481,Why was it  scary movie that did it?
15482,Well were there any?
15483,I would be too. What kind of couch do you have?
15484,"Ohhhh, yeah they are very inspiring. I wish mine didn't die yesterday from a concussion."
15485,"I've never had a friend return stuff for me, that sounds like a super caring friend"
15486,"OH! I thought you mean he returned them to a store, like a bad purchase. Oh man you were drunk! Thats pretty bad lol- But nice friend still"
15487,"Dang, those things are creepy! Did it go away?"
15488,"Yeah, they tend to be very timid creatures. I'm glad you didn't freak out and hit him with a shovel!"
15489,What
15490,"That sounds delicious. My previous response was meant to be, ""What's your favorite meal"", but I accidentally pressed enter."
15491,did it show up on time?
15492,waiting is the hardest part
15493,what was it?
15494,oh thats scary
15495,I have always wanted one of those! They are very charming.
15496,LOL! I love it! What a cute name. I might use that in the future.
15497,Wow that sucks! What kind of diet is she on?
15498,"Dang, I've been thinking about dieting myself. Is it working out well for her?"
15499,Oh my thats good!  where did you loose it?
15500,"Oh my, Atleast he found it wow!"
15501,Are you nervous about it?
15502,I am happy for you!
15503,That's too bad. That sounds lonely.

15508,Oh! I can't read very well tonight. Where did you book?
15509,have you tried contacting the company about it?
15510,Why what did they do to betray your trust?
15511,I would be so mad I dislike when company's charge my card did you call to get a refund for the charge?
15512,I would make a complaint and try contacting the BBB that is so unfair or even get your bank to dispute the charge. 
15513,"Oh, tell me about it, please!"
15514,Oh no! What happened next?
15515,"that is not good i am really sorry to hear that, is he o?"
15516,"that is really nice to hear, hope everything goes as planned"
15517,Oh nice.  What movie did you see?
15518,How was it? Did you like it?
15519,Did something happen to you?
15520,That's a good thing that it wasn't another type of drink!
15521,"uhoh, what happened? did someone hit you?"
15522,wow thats horrible! im sorry
15523,Very true. Has this happened to you recently?
15524,I am sorry to hear that. News like that can come out of nowhere.

15532,That is exciting!  But you are write - children are expensive!
15533,That was very nice of them! Did you tell them you were thankful?
15534,That is good to hear.
15535,"That sounds like fun, what band is playing."
15536,I'm going on a guided fishing trip next month
15537,What was it that gave you problems?
15538,That was generous of him.  But continue to work on your punctuality.
15539,Did they find out where the kid was at?
15540,Maybe she skipped the school for the day?
15541,Was it a lot of fun?
15542,"I'm glad you had a nice time...and they found the child by the way, it was an error."
15543,I'm really happy that he made it. I bet it was a tough thing to go through.
15544,I know what you mean. I wish my dad were still around.
15545,Yea that wouldn't of turn out great.
15546,Good to their safe.
15547,That's nice that you have someone you can trust like that.
15548,I'm glad for you on all of that.
15549,"Oh man, that sounds like a pain."
15550,"That's not good. You didn't get in trouble for that, did you?"
15551,Can you re-take the test?
15552,Ouch that's bad.  Study hard. I'm sure youll do better next time
15553,That sounds fun -but  be careful if there's rough weather!
15554,I hope you catch a BIG ONE (or more) - have a great time!
15555,That does sound like a lot of fun
15556,Is he better now ?
15557,I hope he continues to improve. It's bad when a loved one is ill.
15558,yea that can be hard when things remind you of people
15559,Sometimes you have to just look at the positives though and smile about it
15560,At least you had a lot of fun
15561,"Well, they will get over it"
15562,what kind of project was it? It's always satisfying to see hard work pay off.
15563,I'm sure you'll reap the rewards at your job in the long term.
15564,"ill try not to laugh, i promise.  Tell me about it!"
15565,ouch.  well i hope youre ok.
15566,Well that is just great. Congrats!
15567,How is it going?
15568,It happens like that. Don't give up.
15569,I'm sorry. How long have you been together ?
15570,"Well, maybe it's for the best if you can move on."
15571,Sounds like youre feeling pretty confident. I hope you get the promotion!
15572,I think you will. Just keep doing a good job and keep your confidence up.
15573,Yuck. At least it wasnt IN your house. That is gross.
15574,I would be placing traps all inside my house in case it ever comes inside.
15575,That must have brought back a lot of memories
15576,good ones I hope.
15577,"That's great! I need to start saving money, myself."
15578,Yeah it would be really nice to have some backup funds in case something happens.
15579,"poor dog , did he survive the impact ?"
15580,hopefully he survived the incident
15581,Is it because you are there for him?
15582,He would probably appreciate you doing that.
15583,Oh no. What is wrong? 
15584,That is such a pain. Do you have a credit card to use in the meantime? 
15585,Vacations are the best.   Where are you going?
15586,"Ive heard a lot of good things about Austin, but ive never been.  Ive always wanted to go"
15587,Did you have any damage ?
15588,I'm glad you came through it safely.
15589,That has got to feel good!  Did you get a raise or a new job?
15590,Congratulations!  Your life should feel a little less stressful when you get it!
15591,Anticipation sucks. The hints don't help you figure it out?
15592,HAHA that's a shame. It's just like having to stare at Christmas gifts for a month but not being able to open them as a kid.
15593,"These places should have them clean, because it is inevitably; these things happen"
15594,There are jobs that are hard
15595,You must be so proud. Im sure she put in a lot of work to learn.
15596,"Wow, so talented. That must make you very happy to see them do well at something."
15597,What concert is it ?
15598,What a pleasant surprise.
15599,That sounds like a great memory! I always get nostalgic about pretty much everything. How long ago was it?
15600,I wish I had a group of friends like that. I always just knew people but never got close. 
15601,So peaceful and relaxing right? What a beautiful sight. 
15602,I would too if I could sit outside and enjoy it like you! 
15603,Oh that's great. Is she going to  collge?
15604,What does she want to do?
15605,Oh I hate people like that.    People that flake out like that just have no respect for anyone elses' time.
15606,That sucks. You should have went out anyways.
15607,"uhoh, I hope they dont have a late fee or anything attached to it"
15608,make sure you do it when you get home
15609,"sorry to hear that , try and keep busy or find a hobby eventually you will get over it, its just gonna take a bit of time"
15610,"the gym is a great place to start , make new friends and get fit"
15611,Whoa. That is a big change. That must make you so happy.
15612,Its probably muscle though so you will still look slimmer.
15613,That's great when you have good maintence for a place.
15614,That's such a waste of money and food. Glad its working out though.
15615,awesome! congratulation.  So you are enjoying the job now?
15616,Keep doing what youre doing!  I think youll keep moving up that company ladder in no time
15617,I have felt that. It always sucks feeling like you can
15618,That's the worst. How do they expect people to get around?
15619,Like ever before.
15620,"I'm well mostly, but ready for Fall to come."
15621,and what happened next?
15622,why? He did not do anything bad to you.
15623,Wow I would say the same! Accidents happen but come on pick them up. Im sorry! 
15624,"It really is unreal, but you know people are getting worse and worse these days,. "
15625,Wow how unappreciative they sound. You will be better off at your next job I am sure.
15626,Im sure your next employer will be much better. That is no way to treat an employee.
15627,I bet.  It can be intimidating to start a new regime.
15628,"I should start back to working out.  The older I get, the harder it seems to begin.  Do you have any advice?"
15629,"Lol, that would be awesome to get some free childcare.  My kids tend to drive me nuts at times."
15630,"Yes, thank God that summer is finally over!"
15631,How long ago has this been?
15632,It never gets too far out of your memory. but it will fade over time. I doubt you'll still be feeling like this when you're in the nursing home.
15633,Does that happen often?
15634,And that usually knocks out the power?
15635,Very cool of you to take a stand on something you believe in.
15636,Oh wow. That has to be hard to see. It's great they you are actually doing something about it.
15637,$100! I have never won that much!
15638,I wouldnt even know what to do with an extra $100
15639,How did that end? 
15640,Well we give in to our friends. Hopefully he pays you back and not ruin your friendship.
15641,Wow thats a long time to work together did yall meet at work? 
15642,Thats sad. Im so sorry to hear that! 
15643,I know what you mean
15644,There are other girls
15645,Thats awesome that you have saved all of that.  I bet its heartwarming to look back at all of that stuff
15646,You should get some good storage totes and pack it all up so its safe
15647,I know how you feel. One small decision could make everything nowadays different for you.
15648,If you wonder how things would be different you'd drive yourself nuts.
15649,Did you see any ghosts?
15650,I've been to one of those. They sure find ways to get you!
15651,what are you being tested for?
15652,Well I hope you are okay? Did the doctor hint at anything?
15653,Oh yeah is it nice? 
15654,I know it sucks when people get what you need and its out of sight but I hope you get one soon! 
15655,that's great! I bet you are very proud of them!
15656,you're not! :) I'm sure they will go to college and end up being very successfull
15657,Congrats! When are you going?
15658,That sounds really exciting. Are you taking someone along?
15659,Congradulations. Is this your first time moving in with a boyfriend? 
15660,"I think I would be mad, too."
15661,"This chat has three people in it, it seems.  I am talking to two separate Worker_2's."
15662,ah thats sad. You must have look forwarded to the trip
15663,There's always a next time.
15664,I'm so sorry! It's always sad losing a friend. 
15665,I remember losing my childhood dog. They always stay in your hear.
15666,"It has been really dry here, as well.  We are in a severe drought for the third time in four years."
15667,That sounds like a lot of fun! Where are you headed to? 
15668,I am a sucker for some good deals! 
15669,Did you find a new job or retire?
15670,Congratulations I hope you like it
15671,her loss :) i'm glad you didn't get too stressed about therejection
15672,it is. i remember all the drama from my teen years and how i was stressed and crying over really stupid stuff :) 
15673,"I've never seen that movie, why is it depressing?"
15674,"Oh wow, that is very depressing. I hate movies like that."
15675,"now thats more depressing , cheer up you eventually find better friends "
15676,"not every person in the world is the same , we are all different  i am confident you will find someone "
15677,Congratulations!  Are you going to celebrate?
15678,Why does it take so long to kick in?
15679,That's too bad. Is she feeling better today?
15680,I hope she feels better. That's never fun for mom or child.
15681,Were you able to find out what it was?
15682,"Be safe, they may come back."
15683,Were you expecting them?
15684,"What a surprise! I love when friends go above and beyond like that, it shows that they really care"
15685,I know I hear you... maybe one day we will win the lotto. 
15686,Well I hope one day you get what you want :) 
15687,Did you have some good food?
15688,What happened today? :)
15689,Thats great! What will you guys do together?
15690,Being helpless when waiting for things is the worst feeling. There's nothing you can do but you need to do something!
15691,"yikes, that sucks. Hopefully you found one that worked eventually."
15692,"Your an outstanding mate and great friend, she must have had a hard time my child hood friend died in a car crash and i felt dead inside for a long time"
15693,"yes i still have dreams of my friend , and he passed 12 years ago , i will never forget him"
15694,Thats so sad! Im really sorry. :( Have you been researching about it? 
15695,I cant even begin to imagine how hard that must be. Stay strong! 
15696,Did she break anything ? How old is she ?
15697,Hopefully no breaks.
15698,"I agree, it is good to have something to look forward to. "
15699,I completely agree
15700,But did you even hesitate and think about it?
15701,That's good to hear.  Is there any chance of promotion in the future.
15702,Are they hiring? I could use a new job. 
15703,That is annoying. I wish public transportation was better in the city.
15704,Maybe see if you can do your grocery shopping to. Maybe that will save you from having to do it later in the week.
15705,What was it ? I'm a music lover.
15706,That is one of the tunes that is on the gold record flying out of our solar system on the Voyager probe.
15707,Thats terrible to hear... :( When did you find that out? 
15708,Ugh I dont even know how to respond to that other than to tell you to hang in there. Lots of positive and love your way. 
15709,What sorts of places have you been going? Alone time is always great but then sometimes it gets to be too much so I understand.
15710,You could always do that but maybe exploring on your own can give you a different perspective on things.
15711,Have you tried sharing it to your friends on social media?
15712,Just keep cranking them out. YOur videos will get better and your channel will grow. I know it can be annoying at first.
15713,How do you think you did?
15714,I think you'll do just fine.   Do you still have to take the BAR exam after?
15715,Congrats! That is so cool!
15716,That is really something to be proud of!
15717,That does sound like fun!  What is the came called?
15718,That sounds amazing!  You all must have really enjoyed playing it!
15719,"Are you on wireless, or a wired network?"
15720,"Wow, that sounds terrible. I really do hope you fix your internet problem."
15721,Congratulations. I bet you cant wait.
15722,You are gonna do great. Enjoy your time before you start work.
15723,Ugh I would be bummed too. Dont give up tho! 
15724,"I know, but you will have so many more summers coming up you got this "
15725,Wow.  Have you studied for them?
15726,That is great!  What classes are they in?
15727,"Just enjoy as much time as you can with them , losing loved ones is never easy"
15728,thats sad to hear 
15729,That's fantastic. How old are you?
15730,Keep up the good work.
15731,"oh no, why do you think like that.. All should be good"
15732,ah ok. If intuition tells not to fly. Lets not take chance. you should skip the flight
15733,"I'm sure you did great, do you have doubts that you didn't?"
15734,"It sucks having to wait for something like that, I know, but it will be here soon enough. Try to relax."
15735,that must be pretty frustrating
15736,maybe you should have a talk with her
15737,Oh really? What did they do?
15738,Wow! That was really nice of them.
15739,How did you hurt it?
15740,"That really sucks, I hope you feel better and can take her another day!"
15741,that is ridiculous! that's annoying when people don't clean up after their dogs! I love going to the local park with my son and there is dog poop in the grassy areas
15742,"It is, plus it's so antisanitary"
15743,You should've called the police if they didn't listen to you
15744,It sucks that you were forced to
15745,Has it been a long time? 
15746,Oh whoa. That is pretty crazy. Hopefully yall can become friends again.
15747,I would have been feeling the same way too. Oh well maybe she thought it was cute. 
15748,No way! Come on. You are a champ walk back in there. 
15749,"That is great, do they enjoy it?"
15750,"That is awesome, I am sure it makes you happy"
15751,Oh no. I bet he felt really bad about it.
15752,Is it repairable at all?
15753,"That's great, I'm glad you are transitioning to something new so well."
15754,"That's great, how did you repay her?"
15755,That would be a nice gesture
15756,a surprise party that is awesome - did you have fun ?
15757,im really happy for you 
15758,"Well thats part of being in the workforce, work when everyone is looking, hang out when they are not. Most people arent paid enough to care"
15759,"Sounds a bit harsh, but business is business"
15760,I could imagine. Its a big day you both waited so long for.
15761,Im sure once it was over you realized that you would be okay with that.
15762,Old memories are the best. Do you plan to go back again soon?
15763,"That sounds good, hope you have a great time"
15764,Thats so impressive! You must be proud. 
15765,I would be too. Thats amazing. Good for her! 
15766,"Awesome, You saved yourself a ton of money by doing that!"
15767,Yeah I could not imagine life without the internet
15768,im sure that you will find another soon
15769,"im sorry, i read that wrong. i am very happy for you!"
15770,Yuck! I don't think I'd be able to hold back my own puke if that happened to me.
15771,I know what you mean.  Theres some crazy stuff out there about it too!
15772,The Berenstein bears one i think is crazy
15773,What was it that happened to you?
15774,They are hungry little beast.
15775,Where are you getting lunch?
15776,That sounds fun! Are you going with anyone?
15777,im sorry that is awful
15778,eventually you will feel better again
15779,I bet that will go in the record books. How old is she? 
15780,Thats amazing. You must be proud. Good for her! 
15781,What's it all about?
15782,"Sounds like she just needs some time to settle in, and catch her breath."
15783,Congratulations! thats awesome.  Does he know what hes going for?
15784,"Wow, so he must be really smart then.  Make sure he doesnt do too much partying like I did."
15785,"That is so awesome, you must  be so proud!"
15786,That's so sweet. How did that make you feel?
15787,Yes! We will be planning a second birthday soon! I cant wait!
15788,Who are you talking about?
15789,"Oh awesome, yes childbirth is an amazing feeling"
15790,thats awesome i bet you were very thankful
15791,thats what family is for
15792,That's awesome! I bet you're really proud of her.
15793,I really hope that you continue to encourage her! She may have a future as an artist.
15794,What was that secret? 
15795,All the best for your exams!
15796,"You need to take care of the elderly, I am sure she has cared for you your whole life"
15797,Have you talked to her about this ?
15798,Then use her yard as a garbage can. That's what she does to yours.
15799,I am sure it does. What kind of truck is it? 
15800,sounds super cool! 
15801,"Hey! Yes, I do actually especially when it's nice out."
15802,I carry it in my nalgene wide mouth water bottle. What about you?
15803,Is she far away from you now?
15804,"Oh, can you go across there and visit her?"
15805,Oh yeah what was that? 
15806,That is super sweet of them! So nice. 
15807,That was not very nice of him. Did your parents react well?
15808,What a mean thing to do.
15809,"Yeah, I'm taking care of her for the last few months. "
15810,yeah i should
15811,Could you help her out once in awhile?
15812,Well that is really considerate!
15813,"Haha, you could have played it off as cute and clumsy and maybe they would have been into it"
15814,"Yea thats a good idea.  Be like, hopefully I dont spill this one on me too"
15815,What do you have coming up? Ill keep you in mind.
15816,Just have confidence. It sounds like you already know the outcome. If she says no just dont make a big deal out it.
15817,What was it that you did to feel so courageous?? 
15818,That is well worth taking a chance on since the risk of rejection did not happen and the payoff was a good outcome. She said yes! 
15819,ha ha ha thats a good one tho! Your parents tho omg. Thats funny but I am sure it wasnt in the moment. 
15820,I know I would have been super upset in the moment. 
15821,Was everything okay? Did it take long for the power to come back?
15822,That is scary! I hope nothing came inside
15823,Are you pretty bad with math?
15824,Well maybe you will get a good overall grade and pass!
15825,Is it a hurricane or something worse?
15826,"Oh no, stay indoors for sure!"
15827,That's awesome! What kind of car is it?
15828,"Yeah, I'm jealous. You're so lucky!"
15829,I know it was terrible. Are you from vegas? 
15830,ugh well i hope no one in your family was affected 
15831,"That is great I am so happy for you, what industry are you in?"
15832,"Thats all that matters, and your happiness "
15833,"Oh my God, that's terrible."
15834,"Well, I will pray for you, and I hope our advanced medicine and doctors can cure him."
15835,Keep your head up and ask around if anyone has oppurtunites for you
15836,"It will get better, its always darkest just before the dawn"
15837,That happens sometimes.  How did you end up doing in the end?
15838,Don't sweat it.  There's plenty of other competitions that you can try again at.
15839,"Yeah, It's priceless moment. Being a mother, I can understand your feelings."
15840,Each birth is special irrelevant of first or second. I am happy for you though
15841,What are you doing now?
15842,"That is awesome, good for you!"
15843,Are you serious
15844,Does he still have your car
15845,"YEs it does, take advantage of the time you have now"
15846,Reach out to them and see how they are!
15847,Thats awesome. I love getting money as a gift.  Then you get to spend it how you want
15848,"Paying off debt is where i am now.  its hard work, but so worth it"
15849,thats awesome i cant wait to have kids!
15850,i bet!
15851,"Oh no, did you see who did it?"
15852,"Darn, I hope your insurance covers it"
15853,That's unfortunate. What made you so scared of it?
15854,There were no lights in the basement?
15855,I'm proud of you! I attend both Sunday and Wednesday nights each week
15856,God is always there for you and always will be. 
15857,Are you going to keep her?
15858,Is she a brown doggy?
15859,That's great! What kind of project is it?
15860,Making money's always good! Do you think it'll be a success?
15861,it is frustrating to watch i agre
15862,"that is unfortunate, hopefully you can give them guidance"
15863,were they your children?
15864,I would be too. I would have complained to staff.
15865,What kind do you have at the moment
15866,"Nice I love German Shephards! They are cute when puppies and monsters when they grow up, my kind of dog"
15867,"Good for you, as an added bonus you are saving more money!"
15868,Cigarettes are very expensive depending on where you live
15869,At least you finally got one! Sometimes it helps not to focus too much on what everyone has has or has done.
15870,"I get it, everyone wants their first kiss like yesterday! It's a big moment!"
15871,"Oh no, do you have a digital backup?"
15872,"Its ok, you can always make new memories, it will not replace what you have lost, but it is a start"
15873,That's pretty messed up. Why did you do that?
15874,Are you going to tell her?
15875,"That is awesome, what will you spend it on?"
15876,"Good for you, make sure you get the 20% down."
15877,"There is no ""right place"" to be for everyone. Each person has their own individual path"
15878,I think that we are free to do as we want and we are in control of our fate.
15879,"Oh really, what happened?"
15880,"Oh wow, you must've been pretty tired to make a mistake like that."
15881,i have never seen it
15882,i will check it out then!
15883,"Aw, I really sorry to hear that. Is is serious?"
15884,"I'm sorry, At least you can rest assured knowing that your cat lived a long life."
15885,That really sucks that that happened to you. Maybe start by putting small amounts of trust in people
15886,"Ha, sometimes the only person you can trust is yourself."
15887,Nice what kind of project was it
15888,That's aweseome. I'm happy it turned out well. You must be pretty artistic
15889,That is the best feeling! I love getting a good deal on a great product.
15890,Sounds like it was a nice surprise :)
15891,I know how you feel! I'm about to be 30 and i feel so old lol
15892,"that's really great! you are such an optimist, i need to learn from you :)"
15893,What were they being eliminated from?
15894,Were the singers any good?
15895,waht type of game is x game?
15896,"ok ,so was it fun?"
15897,I'm glad you had a nice trip. Was it your first.
15898,I would have thought it would be the other way around.
15899,Oh no! Did she miss school?
15900,Well good thing she got there! Kids always tend to want to go to bed at the last minute and end up not sleeping enough or sleeping past their alarms!
15901,"Oh man, Fight Club is a great movie! I just recently saw it myself and was really surprised too."
15902,"I agree, that movie is definitely ahead of it's time!"
15903,That's cool.  Where at
15904,"That's aweseome I've always wanted to go to Cali...from the Midwest, moved to TX to escape the desolate tundra haha"
15905,Do you like Mexican style foods?
15906,Oh did you tell your boyfriend about it?
15907,"What kind are you looking for? I don't know about you, but I hate car shopping!"
15908,I understand that. Gas is so expensive!
15909,Oh where are you going? Is it a long trip?
15910,Make a list and start packing for it a couple days in advance! 
15911,"oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
15912,That's horrible. I am sorry for your loss. 
15913,Did you help him to learn the swim techniques?
15914,That's pretty awesome...were you happy to see one or were you nervous
15915,Oh man he must have been huge...did you get any pictures
15916,"Oh wow, that's amazing! I workout as well."
15917,"I actually injured my back a while back as well. I haven't gone to the doctor yet, though!"
15918,"Oh no, I'm sorry for your loss. Cats are such nice companions."
15919,"Yes, time will help get over those feelings. Do you plan to get another one?"
15920,Oh man I know how you feel. How old was your bird?
15921,That is horrible. Take some time and grieve. Im always here if you need someone to talk to.
15922,That is awesome!  DO yo have to pay for Headstart?
15923,"That's great.  My daughter is 3, so I hope I can get her into a program like that!"
15924,That's cool. We saw it when it came out.
15925,It was exciting.
15926,What type of job do you have now?
15927,Oh that is nice. Do you have a website for your business?
15928,And what news would that be
15929,best of luck friend
15930,Oh wow! That would be so scary! What happened?
15931,How far from shore were you?
15932,"That's awesome, congrats! Do you have a job lined up for when you finish?"
15933,"Yes, it will be nice to have a good pay cheque coming in."
15934,"Wow, that's a pretty cool hobby. Just a small plane?"
15935,Yeah I always thought it would be fun to learn to do that. 
15936,"Haha, I've seen plenty do wheelies. I've seen a few crash too, sadly"
15937,"That takes a lot of nerve, so kudos to that guy. I'd never do that because I'd probably die lol"
15938,That's great!  Don't be too nervous!  Your date is most likely just as nervous as you are!
15939,"Just try to have a fun time and let what happens, happen!"
15940,Yeah they're great. Super light and rigid.  They feel kind of springy when you ride them
15941,Do you have clipless pedals on it?
15942,Absolutely. It doesn't help that I'm pretty introverted.
15943,I hate when you help someone out and they take advantage of you. I could never do that to someone.
15944,"Why do you feel bad? It is a tough decision for sure, but you should never have to feel bad about it."
15945,"I hear you on that, but the way it is right now, everything we do is destroying the environment, and I'm sure you do plenty already to help. Until electric vehicles are more affordable and reliable, you can't blame yourself for the choice. I'm sure your words have affected others and made them rethink their choices, and all that helps and adds up."
15946,Blessing are another reason to be grateful! 
15947,How long were you married?
15948,That's really generous of her.  She'll grow up to have pretty good karma 
15949,Yes.  I once helped out a friend in a car wreck.  A month later I got a flat tire changed for free
15950,Oh man! That's some Jerry Springer level drama. What happened? Did you tell him/
15951,Are they going to break up?
15952,"Oh man, that must have been humiliating! Did people notice?"
15953,"Oh, man! I'm sorry to hear that. Gotta be careful next time!"
15954,"Congrats! How did you do it, and where do you work?"
15955,"My mom worked at a bank, and it's not as easy as you'd think it'd be, that's for sure. Congratulations again!"
15956,Everything is harder until we do it. And am proud of you for donating blood. It is one of the good habit of this human race i would say.
15957,"yeah am B+, O+ is quite common and it can match for other blood group and O-ve is the opposite"
15958,"You met Johnny Dep? I have no idea, what happened?"
15959,"Wow, that's pretty cool! Congrats! That's a pretty exciting new thing in your life."
15960,Do you think they just didn't want to pay for your retirement?
15961,Are you a part of the union?
15962,Wow that's cool...with hers or your credit card..?
15963,Then she's a keeper for sure
15964,Sounce like you're a bit of an introvert.
15965,"Yeah, That gets old after a whle for me.    "
15966,Well that's awful. Did you ask him why he didn't pick you?
15967,"Yes, I hope so too. it's nice to get promotions at work."
15968,You must be so happy! What kind of car?
15969,Oh hell yeah! I bet you're so thankful to your parents. Enjoy your new car!
15970,Oh that's cool.  Glad it worked out for her
15971,Boy or girl?
15972,"That's impressive but, 45 mags are rare. are you sure it wasn't a 44 magnum?"
15973,Interesting.  It is a real bullet. 
15974,Oh no! What happened?
15975,Oh that is nasty! What did you do?
15976,"Congrats, is your son very old or young?"
15977,Is he a sports player for the scholarships?
15978,Holy crap! Did you see what it was?
15979,Oh wow. Should have taken pictures of it and used the internet to help you figure out what it was! I'd be curious.
15980,"Oh no, did you get hurt very badly?"
15981,I hope both our ego and your nose heal up quickly!
15982,I'm sorry. That must be difficult. I am glad you have pictures to hold on to though.
15983,"That's too bad you couldn't go, but memories are great to have!"
15984,Oh nice! Hope you get it
15985,Best of luck!
15986,that is absolutely amazing! I'm so proud of you! You should be very proud of yourself as well
15987,I'm a stay at home mom and honestly it's the hardest job i've ever had but the most rewarding one :) I told my husband i want to keep having kids so i won't have to work again lol
15988,Was there a big name event going on? I've seen the Blue Angles live 
15989,"/oh no, what happened, whats the problem with the provider"
15990,Bad customer service. You should definitely switch
15991,"Sometimes that happens when you take a break from something for too long, but with some practice you might be able to pick it back up again"
15992,"if they are really your friends, they wont care if you were bad"
15993,"Absolutely! I've always noticed that phenomena. If you act too desperate it actually puts them off. On the contrary, acting a little disinterested gets THEM more interested."
15994,I can agree with that. Women like a man who is dedicated to something. It shows good characer.
15995,That's cool.  I'll have to try those out sometime
15996,Nice does it go well with any dip? Or is it better alone
15997,Its always a great time when that happens.  My best friend and I moved away so I hadly ever see them now
15998,"It is, it makes all those memories just flood back"
15999,Oh yes! Deja Vu has happened to me quite a bit! It's eerie and cool huh?
16000,It's always intense running into ex's. I'm glad your guys conversation went well and you guys could catch up. 
16001,He probably passed the infection to his mouth! Gross!
16002,"He needs to be quarantined whenever he gets some kind of sickness, lol."
16003,"Oh awesome! That's crazy, because my 30th birthday is next week, lol. What makes you excited? Because I'm dreading mine."
16004,"Hahaha, I guess that's true. For me it's pretty bad. I don't know if you're familiar with the internet term, but on my 30th birthday, I'm going to be a ""wizard"" lol."
16005,I've always wanted one of those! I hope you enjoy it.
16006,"I've tried some of the cheaper virtual reality headsets, but I'm sure they can't compare at all!"
16007,That would make me so mad!  What did you do?
16008,You should!  No one should have to clean up after someone elses animal.
16009,"Im glad you made changes for the positive in your life.  You cant go back into the past, but you can keep moving forward"
16010,What kind of changes have you made and why did you decide to make them?
16011,Why do you think you'll get fired
16012,Do you plan on discussing this with your boss? 
16013,That would be so scary! Did it work on the first try?
16014,I can't imagine. Are you planning on going parachuting again? 
16015,"Oh sweet, I can't even  imagine the excitement you must have. I hope everything works out for you!"
16016,We need more musicians who are about the music and bringing enlightenment to people. We got way too much commercial garbage on the radio. I really hope your message resonates with people.
16017,More than a couple of times.
16018,That's not bad at all.  
16019,I would never go to that place again. Did you go to a different place?
16020,that's horrible! I'm sorry to hear that. if i was you i would write a bad review on this restaurant's facebook page
16021,i get you. i hate fighting but i'm not going to be disrespected either.
16022,i totally understand that.
16023,Hm I can relate to that haha
16024,I'm not always broke but I feel like what helps is leaving my credit / debit card at home and just carry cash for what I need
16025,That must have been really annoying. Sucks to be a person who's on time dealing with people who don't care about being on time themselves.
16026,Did you say anything after they arrived?
16027,As long as it takes you from A to B and safe to drive that's all that matters:) I used to have 1995 camry and it looked old and beat up but it was the best car i've had
16028,i feel like those type of cars are the most reliable! 
16029,She spend all  youre retirement money? That's pretty messed up.  Why did she do that?
16030,Are you going to divorce her?
16031,Are you going to the police?
16032,Oh I hope you can find an alternative
16033,Sounds like you'll be alright after all
16034,At least it's better than having nothing to use
16035,I'm sorry. How long had you been together?
16036,I hope you feel better soon.
16037,"oh no, is she on computer too much?"
16038,you got a fair point. You would need to soften her with something else other wise children's will keep aggravate you 
16039,"Ooh, awesome! I bet everyone's excited! I hope the future holds many more wonderful things for you!"
16040,"Yea, some people really prove that hard work can pay off. I hope he enjoys the promotion!"
16041,Have you gone on dates before?
16042,"It could be that but some of my friends have said that with social media and online dating, it's harder and harder to truly connect with someone. There are a lot of people out there struggling."
16043,I still think you made the right choice by going.
16044,"True.. but, who knows... maybe you'll make a new friend."
16045,I am so sorry. That is heartbreaking.
16046,Itll take some time to grieve. Just make sure you have close friends and family nearby to talk to.
16047,"Whoa, did it stink? Was it roadkill?"
16048,"Haha, man, I bet that was fun. Poor skunk didn't know what hit him."
16049,what is making you have second thoughts?
16050,there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions.
16051,"As we say around here, you ain't lying! How long were you waiting?"
16052,"We have all been there! How hard would it be to put a few extra pens out? They gotta be worth like what, a couple pennies a pop?"
16053,Wow! Did you thank your mom or buy her any gifts on your trip?
16054,Dang! Can I get a hug too? 
16055,"Wow, I bet that was nostalgic. How'd it feel seeing your old self doing fun stuff?"
16056,"Haha, yea, although some people I know haven't changed at all. I just miss the energy I had from when I was younger."
16057,That's great. You must be excited.    Have you played all the smash bros games?
16058,"That's pretty cool. I've never played it before, What genre is it?"
16059,That sounds fun I might have to check it out.  It sounds pretty nostalgic.
16060,"I won't have a switch but, I think that may be worth checking out."
16061,I understand where you are coming from. Can you blame her for window shopping though?
16062,"Honestly, we all do it. Plus, who cares if she checks out other guys if she is coming home with you!"
16063,That's awesome. you must be excited.  I've been to cancun but not cozumel.
16064,You're not worried about the bad booze or kidnappings?
16065,I would hate to live by myself. I have been married 21 years and have 6 kids and 7 grandkids. I don't know what it's like to be alone.
16066,"Yeah, my kids are almost all grown. I don't know what I will do when they are all gone. I guess I will just enjoy the grandkids and my husband. It will be different."
16067,"Oh gosh! That's terrible. I stayed in a house with a rat problem for a while, it was not fun. What're you going to do about them?"
16068,"Woooow, haha. Time for a game plan! I hope you can get rid of them, you may need to call up some friends or an exterminator."
16069,Yes all the time! That sounds like a nice dream. Do you still have a close relationship with your family?
16070,"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can repair and issues you have between you guys. There's nothing more important than family."
16071,Oh my gosh that's terrifying! What kind of snake was it? And what did you do?
16072,That's awesome! I am truly impressed with your handling of the situation.
16073,"I have 3, do you have any"
16074,I don't think I could work in a daycare. It would be overwhelming.
16075,Some people are just better at working with kids.
16076,I like kids but I wouldn't want to work with them all day.
16077,That is the worst. 
16078,lol. All men do for that matter
16079,"Wow, what a surprise!"
16080,Oh why is that?
16081,"it is indeed, learning things at young age is a boon. you got an exceptional daughter"
16082,haha!! you are i guess!!
16083,oh no. did you try to retrace your steps to find it?
16084,oh that stinks. did you have phone insurance at least?
16085,i'm so sorry. hopefully there is something they can do for you
16086,it's worth it so you don't have to be without a phone.
16087,So it wasn't a kitten?
16088,There were some burds fighting under my car once and I thought it was cats.
16089,That sounds like fun! It's great to spend time with our children. Did you have fun?
16090,"Oh yes, they can do that when they get older. My daughter is a teenager now, so I can relate!"
16091,I bet it was! I have two kids but they're pretty young. I'm looking forward to seeing them achieve the same thing.
16092,My son is going to the fourth grade and has been doing great so far. I hope he can keep it up!
16093,"oh man, that is the worst! all that hard work, ruined"
16094,i love eggs and cheese and would have been heartbroken. good thing pizza was available
16095,I have never heard of that
16096,oh cool. I never been to any kind of motorcycle event
16097,I bet.  What grades are they in?
16098,Are you excited for them?
16099,That's really frustrating. What band was it a t-shirt for?
16100,"Oh, I bet I could guess what kind of music they'd play. Sorry about your shirt problem, though."
16101,"i used to go fishing with my grandpa a lot as a kid, brings back awesome memories"
16102,i feel the exact same way. i haven't fished in years for that same reason
16103,That's a good feeling
16104,How many kids do you want?
16105,Oh dang! Did you file for classes late?
16106,I'm so sorry to hear it! Were you able to take anything?
16107,That's my favorite part of facebook!  Especially when I see old pics of my kids.
16108,"About this time of year, there's a lot of 'first day of school' pics."
16109,"And in between football games and soccer games, and christmases - it's a healthy reminder that time flies so quickly!"
16110,"I know Google Photos has a little reminder thingy where it says something like, ""Remember this day?"""
16111,Oh that is awesome! Im sure you do! Waiting for that can really feel like forever when its only been a few minutes!
16112,Its good that you are excited! Im sure you will be a great asset for them!
16113,Haha!  I am only laughing because I know exactly what you are talking about!  That has happened to me a couple times!.  I had to use a hand towel once!
16114,Ha!  I wasn't thinking at the time.  I was just grabbing whatever was around!
16115,Did you go with anyone?
16116,Thats good! Relationships aren't for everyone all the time. You have to love yourself before you can love someone else right?
16117,"Yes, and you will end up meeting someone when youre not looking and n ot expecting it. "
16118,Thats no good
16119,i know that feelingh
16120,That's good. Your interview must have went really well.
16121,Well I hope you get it then.
16122,thats good.its very important to instill good learning and study habbits. something i wish i had as kid
16123,sounds like she is ready to succeed 
16124,That is good to hear. I am glad you did not overspend and go into debt.
16125,I hope you can find another job soon.
16126,I love self gifts. what was it
16127,Thats pretty cool
16128,Really?Is it a good show? I've never heard of it. 
16129,I'm the same way! Although now that I know it is scary I probably won't watch it!
16130,Thats pretty sweet
16131,What kind of cake?
16132,That sounds about right. How old is she?
16133,At 13 everything is interesting to her. She may just want attention.
16134,"I just got in a few months ago, best of luck my friend!"
16135,I am in the Information Systems field
16136,Yes! My husband and I bought the old school Nintendo and played a couple of months back.
16137,"They are, I really enjoyed playing them. We also played Donkey Kong."
16138,Why is that making you sad?
16139,"That is true, well there is a lot of time left"
16140,I love playing Mario!
16141,"I haven't played that one, I will have to try it out."
16142,That's nice of you. Is it a special occasion?
16143,Use a recipe and stick to it. If he is a good boyfriend he will appreciate your effort.
16144,Oh my word! I wouls have just died
16145,Where did it go?
16146,That's sweet! Family is so important and relationships with siblings is a very significant one in our lives. I felt the same about my sister.
16147,"We weren't, only 2 1/2 years. It was just the two of us and we were very close, she passed away several years ago."
16148,"I do, I used to play growing up."
16149,I will have to try it out!
16150,What field is that for? I am sure that is a lot of stress
16151,"That makes sense, well I wish you the best of luck!"
16152,"Well, you can't do everything."
16153,Give yourself a break. Your financial health is important too.
16154,"That is smart, money is tight these days"
16155,"That can be tough to do, but will pay off in the long run!"
16156,Everyone has bad bosses. Just keep working hard and they will have to recognize your greatness.
16157,Then maybe you should think about trying to find a job somewhere else?
16158,What did you get?
16159,"Seriously? Do you like super smash bros? It is coming out in december, I love my switch to death man, it is amazing"
16160,"I have been there, I hope everything works out for you!"
16161,"Thank goodness, that will make you stressed."
16162,Oh that is nice! What happened at the party?
16163,Oh that's nice! Enjoy summer while it lasts. What did you go to college for?
16164,Yeah that was awesome! I feel like they have a less than stellar track record when it comes to fan service.
16165,I get where you are coming from. Nintendo fans are not easy to please!
16166,I love the fair! Did you have a good time?
16167,That sounds like a great time!
16168,What is your field ?
16169,We need you. Hang in there.
16170,What are they for?
16171,"Ah okay, that is good then, I hope they are effective for you!"
16172,"Oh, most jobs don't unfortunately"
16173,That's very unusual. Most jobs don't. I would talk to the managers about it! Paid lunch would be great
16174,"Well, maybe the time in bed will help you relax"
16175,That must be quite dissapointing
16176,That sounds really exciting? what was it?
16177,Congratulations.  Thats awesome.  I hope you give him the world
16178,"I'm sorry to hear that, growing up can be tough."
16179,"That is hard, especially being so far away from family."
16180,That's wonderful. I have two daughters 10 and 13. I wish you the best.
16181,"You'll do fine. As long as you love him, everything else will work out."
16182,"I haven't heard about the ""direct"" yet. What about it do you like?"
16183,That sounds exciting! I can't wait to what they come up with next!
16184,I know that feeling.  I do phone support too.
16185,"Yep, but you can only help one person at a time."
16186,"Oh, that would not have been fun! They do not like people!"
16187,That's terrible. 
16188,Are you going to say anything to your surperiors.
16189,"Oh, well they probably do not need any ice cream!"
16190,"Haha, they can eat ice cream when they are the parents!"
16191,Aw he's still a little guy.
16192,Cherish the moment while you can!
16193,"Oh no, I hate to heart that. I hope everything is okay."
16194,Something big must have happened.
16195,"Oh no, did something happen to have caused it?"
16196,I'm sorry to hear about what happened. Are you staying with your wife?
16197,That is bad. What are you planning to do instead?
16198,That is good also. Hanging out with friends is the best thing to do.
16199,That's great! I must have been so cool to see that!
16200,That's really great!
16201,"No way, that is the worst. Did you ask your roommate why he or she ate it?"
16202,I am sorry to hear that! 
16203,Is that the first day ?
16204,That's nice. Mine started a couple of weeks ago.
16205,That's a good thing. It can sometimes be overwhelming though
16206,I know what you mean. We are getting club schedules together for my teen
16207,You are very fortunate. Have you decided on a name yet?
16208,"You will know when the time is right. I am adopted myself, so I have a special place in my heart for new parents."
16209,That sounds fun!
16210,Did you get a lot of gifts too?
16211,Children are angels!
16212,"Yes, that happens everytime!"
16213,Those games are usually so fun.
16214,I will do that.
16215,"Congrats, how fast did it go by?"
16216,"Ugh I was hoping that is not the case, I would want my kid to be young forever"
16217,I had to work when I turned 21. That must have been awesome
16218,I went to the casino after and won 250 dollars but I was by myself lol
16219,"Sorry to hear that, i hope you get chances to visit!"
16220,"I enjoy football, but I mainly enjoy that when football happens, fall comes."
16221,What do you do for work?
16222,I am so thankful that I am able to stay home with my child.
16223,It really is!
16224,I am glad it did not make you depressed!
16225,"I am sorry to hear that, I have been there before."
16226,"I think so, that's the giant shark movie, right ?"
16227,I've never been much for sea stuff for some reason.
16228,"no, it's just not my thing. I like sci fi and horror...just not sea stuff"
16229,I know exactly what you mean
16230,"I hate that too. Especially when you are paying and they are right behind you... like, why?"
16231,Does he at least work hard for it ?
16232,Hopefully he  has worked hard for it. I'm sorry you have to deal with that
16233,I can imagine. 
16234,You have a lot of hard work ahead.
16235,That's awesome. What kind of car.
16236,That is a nice car! 
16237,I am so sorry to hear that. I am glad you found people to count on.
16238,"Me neither, how do you feel about it?"
16239,"me too, best of luck!"
16240,That's really sweet. Is there any member of your family you are particularly close with?
16241,"Siblings can be our closest confidants, and in a lot of cases, lifelong friends."
16242,do you like being home alone much?
16243,"yeah i can relate to that, alone time is sometimes very relaxing"
16244,I bet. That is a special moment
16245,What did you name him?
16246,That's so cute. I have a son named Ethan
16247,"That sounds fun, did she have a good time?"
16248,That is even better! School shopping can be so expensive.
16249,"Uh oh, are you ready for the ""Terrible 2's""?"
16250,He will be into everything. I know what you mean about looking back. Kids grow so fast.
16251,"Oh no, I am so sorry! I hope you find him."
16252,I'm sure he will return!
16253,That's cool.
16254,I was told that recently. My ilfe revolves around my kids
16255,I know exactly whaat you're saying
16256,Well that's fun!  Did he do a good job?
16257,Cool I'm glad it was a success.  I hope it reminded you of good times!
16258,did you like that? i find reusing dresses very combinient
16259,"that is really nice, i still have my wedding dress"
16260,That's so nice!
16261,Hey children are a miricle. 
16262,That's nice. What sort of work do you do?
16263,"Great, how about a loan ? Just kidding."
16264,"wow, it sounds like a very exotic holiday"
16265,"Ok, but at least you got to do something you have always wanted right? visit gulf shores"
16266,I hate how itchy you get after being bitten.
16267,"The bites take forever to go away, too!"
16268,It's a difficult fact of life
16269,I think that's normal! Eventually you will adjust
16270,Can't you just get another one?
16271,Maybe you can just get another job.
16272,"Oh no, you should probably deal with the consequences"
16273,"Don't worry too much about it, worrying can actually make you preform worse. You can always retake the test!"
16274,You got it!
16275,"Wow, then you know how it feels. I hope you do great."
16276,I bet you won't have anything to worry about. We will both excel.
16277,"Oh no! I've never seen that movie, but it sounds like it was very horrifying! Have you watched it as an adult?"
16278,"Well, at least you were able to conquer your fear!"
16279,"Wow, that is sleazy, what did you do?"
16280,"I do not know, how did you discover that was the case?"
16281,that is sad i wish you and your family the best of wishes
16282,"that is normal when you lose someone, but time heals everything"
16283,"That is gross, what kind of food?"
16284,"That is nasty, you have to kill that habit!"
16285,"That's great, we all deserve to feel peace and happiness with how our lives are going."
16286,You're a kind person to wish that.
16287,Oh no! I hope you didn't feel too humiliated.
16288,That something which you should be proud of.
16289,I hate interest too. It is always to pay cash.
16290,"If you were given the project, it's probably because someone thinks you can do it!"
16291,It's a very good feeling when someone has faith in you! Good luck with your project!
16292,You should get the same sneakers then.
16293,"Just save up and eventually, you will be able to get them."
16294,Were you scared? Hope it wasn't a mean dog.
16295,Good idea. Glad you got away safely.
16296,"Oh, good luck! Are you nervous for the job interview?"
16297,It's so great to be prepared! I'm sure the interviewers will be impressed!
16298,Sounds like you're ready to ride out the storm. Are you afraid?
16299,True. I bet it was a mad house at the supermarket today.
16300,That is so nerve racking. I'm sure you will do great.
16301,Do you usually do good in math? It is my favorite subject and always came so easy for me.
16302,"Yeah, that can be a tough time. Pretty soon he'll be off to college!"
16303,"Well, I am sure he will meet a bunch of jolly good fellows while he's still in high school. You just got to keep on top of him with his grades and he will be fine."
16304,"Hey, I'm looking forward to it too! Can't wait to crush my co-workers."
16305,I play on the PS4. It's the only way to play Madden.
16306,what book you reading?
16307,"lol i feel you, i too am lacking in that department"
16308,That is too bad. How did they get hurt?
16309,Ouch. I hope he didn't lose any teeth.
16310,Why did you think he was after you?
16311,Although you might have really been scared your story sound kind of funny!
16312,"Oh, lucky you! What's his or her name? "
16313,That's so wonderful. My boyfriend has a cat named Smoke (I call him Smok) that I love sooo much. Good luck!
16314,"Yeah, that feature is pretty nifty. Makes it so you don't have to keep hardcopy photo albums anymore! "
16315,I feel you man. Seeing pictures of my baby son tears me right up.
16316,That's really nice of her!  Was there a special occasion or anything?
16317,"Dang, kind of reminds me I should probably do something nice for my wife..."
16318,That's unfortunate. What type of exam do you have?
16319,How ironic. Unable to study finances because you're at work making your own.
16320,"Oh no, what's up?"
16321,The anticipation must be crazy.
16322,Nice! What kind of cake was it?
16323,Those cakes are really good! I believe they are made of dried milk.
16324,Was it planned?
16325,That's terrible. Did they give you a reason?
16326,"Wow, what a lucky day for you!"
16327,"Pizza is my absolute favorite, I could eat it for the rest of my life."
16328,aw looks isn't everything.
16329,Wow. I've gotta see this guy then.
16330,How unprofessional of your professor to say that! What was your project over?
16331,"Silver lining: she said she didn't want to fail you, so at least you passed your project."
16332,Atleast you gave something it's the thought that counts right.
16333,As long as she knows where your intentions are the amount doesn't matter we all wish we can do more but we do what we can don't be down.
16334,"Oh man, I bet you didn't sleep for weeks!"
16335,"No, it wasn't. I bet you learned your lesson not to steal pretty quickly."
16336,That's so cool! What did you think about that?
16337,Very interesting. Maybe I should look into that to connect to my great grandmother.
16338,How did you cheat?
16339,"Hopefully, you pass at least."
16340,Oh dang. Did anyone come eventually?
16341,"Well, at least you weren't left there for all eternity."
16342,Reminiscing on memories how old was you are ya'll still together?
16343,So young lol well at least it's a good memory and the good weather makes you happy and think about it. 
16344,They usually are. Who's wedding did you go to?
16345,Of course! I'm sure he appreciated you being there!
16346,I hate it when that happens. You should get a lock for the fridge.
16347,Some people just have no consideration. You deserve to eat your leftover Chinese.
16348,"i bet your excited, wish i was you"
16349,"good for you, send me a post card, enjoy"
16350,Well that's nice of you. Did he give you anything in return?
16351,Wow. I wonder how they even saw that the grass needed to be cut living in darkness.
16352,"Well, at least he/she feels better now? Sorry about your shoes."
16353,Wow. I didn't know shoes could cost that much!
16354,"Wow, that's quite the career leap! What made you do it?"
16355,That makes sense to me. Money doesn't always equate to happiness. Hope you are doing better now!
16356,"Aw, I'm sorry. Losing a pet is very hard. I recently lost a cat. It hurts."
16357,"Thank you. Yes, even though it's been a month since we said goodbye, I still look for him around the house. "
16358,Oh wow! Are you afraid of heights at all?
16359,"That's great! Maybe I should conquer my fear of heights that way, too!"
16360,"Wow, that's incredible! Good for him."
16361,"I think so too, he knows what it's like to be down and out and to work hard for his own success."
16362,I'm sorry to hear about that. What are the risks if you were to go through with it?
16363,That is definitely risky. Is the alternative of staying sick better?
16364,That's awesome! Math is pretty tough.
16365,Glad all that studying worked out!
16366,"Aw, I am sorry to hear that. Are things better now between the two of you?"
16367,Distance is sometimes the best healer. Glad to hear things are patched up.
16368,Oh no :( did you take him to the vet? what kind of dog is it?
16369,Those are such smart dogs! I hope it's nothing
16370,That can be scary! Do you feel prepared?
16371,"You'll be okay! Use the age old public speaking advice, picture everyone in their underwear! Good luck!"
16372,I hope it turns out well!
16373,It must be such a relief. I'm happy for ya.
16374,Nice! How did it turn out?
16375,I am sure she will like it as long as you followed the recipe.
16376,That's awesome! Good luck to ya.
16377,Are you a math major?
16378,That's an interesting combination. Did you make it up off the top of your head?
16379,"I like how creative you got with it, I'll need to try it sometime."
16380,New jobs nerves is pretty normal. Get a good rest!
16381,"Oh man, that nervous, hu?"
16382,"Dang, that sucks. Do you have an insurance policy on it?"
16383,Nice. At least you won't lose any money.
16384,That's adorable! What was the word?
16385,Oh my. That is quite a unique first word!
16386,"Yeah, it can be tough. Especially if you're in a heated argument."
16387,"I know right?!? Sometimes it's just best to be quiet, even though you know you are right, to help things get better."
16388,I know how you feel! I don't have carpet in my living room for that reason- Sometimes they have accidents. I hate poo accidents especially!
16389,"Oh yes, best to have her not alone ever during this time."
16390,Was it yours or the bank's fault?
16391,"If it was the bank's mistake, even if you didn't have enough money, they're responsible for fixing it."
16392,That's perfection. I rescue animals as well.and have many more cats then that lol. It is very needed to help cats
16393,"Me too! It's very hard sometimes, like running an orphanage but it is rewarding as well!"
16394,How old is it? Did you guys play on it a lot together?
16395,"That's cool, I don't know the first thing about building my own pc."
16396,Did he/she say something you may disagree with?
16397,That sounds unprofessional. I thought they were supposed to sound neutral.
16398,I didn't know such a thing existed! What store?
16399,"Oh! That's a nice program. Well getting any amount of groceries for free is nice, but yes too bad it wasn't a supermarket sweep"
16400,I'm sorry to hear that. Is something wrong?
16401,LIttle things build up sometimes. I hope you feel better as well.
16402,Was it Domino's pizza?
16403,Because I love Domino's so that's the only pizza I think of!
16404,Oh who was there?!
16405,Oh sweet. How's the new phone?
16406,That would really annoy me! Did you end up taking any action against them? I know some companies will tow a vehicle that does that.
16407,"Man, the nerve on some people. I would never take somebody's spot if they have a sign up for it!"
16408,What a glutton. Did he happen to have a mountain of crab legs?
16409,"Man, I feel bad for his stomach. It's probably as worn out and bloated as my great granddad."
16410,50?  That might be a world record or something.  How did you find out?
16411,I guess he learned his lesson.  Only eat 25.  ha ha.
16412,"I agree, I loved that show so much when I was little."
16413,"I agree, what's your favorite?"
16414,Mental illness is very tough to deal with it by themselves.
16415,Who are the caregivers? His/her parents? Or Children?
16416,Are you in trouble?
16417,"Well they can be, but make sure you buy it next time. Ramen is super cheap :)"
16418,That must have been very nostalgic
16419,Kids grow up so fast. Gotta cherish every moment sometimes.
16420,That is tough.  How is she doing?
16421,That is terrible.  Has she cut off all contact with them?
16422,That sucks. And you guys studied the same amount?
16423,How do you feel?
16424,"That's great! Hopefully, the meeting goes well."
16425,"Pet alligator! Why do you have him as a pet, is he a rescue?"
16426,"Well, I'm not sure about that or how are you typing?! "
16427,Oh yeah? What did your dog do?
16428,"Awwwww, that's so cool. I remember when my dog was going through all that over a year ago. They learn so fast."
16429,Nice! What is he working on?
16430,I'm sure he won't. Sounds like he's a hard worker.
16431,Oh wow. I wonder what that kind of bite feels like. Did it hurt?
16432,"Right, have to train them not to I suppose, if at all possible."
16433,That is good. When do you have the exam?
16434,Good luck.
16435,Dang. Why don't you just get your own?
16436,That's reasonable. Just make sure you get your own when you have the funds available.
16437,That sounds like a lot of fun. What do you do now?
16438,Oh so sorry to hear that. Well maybe you can round them up for something.
16439,"I completely agree!  I am all about keeping the earth clean, recycling, and low waste living.  They should get bigger fines!"
16440,"I'm right with you.  Oh, cigarette butts gross me out, not to mention second hand smoke which has been found to cause cancer too."
16441,Oh god. Does that store have sanitizing wipes?
16442,Some people just aren't considerate of others like that.
16443,Do you normally do makeovers?
16444,Wow that would be so cool! I don't do makeup good on others. Did you do anything with her hair?
16445,That's wonderful. What was it?
16446,That's so cute!
16447,Nice! Is she happy about it?
16448,That's too bad. Maybe she can come with you?
16449,"That sounds about right for the bus station, unfortunately. How did everyone react when they saw it?"
16450,Wow. I hope you don't ever have to see anything like that again!
16451,"Haha, I wouldn't worry about it. There is much worse things you can do. Unless you're doing something you shouldn't be doing online!"
16452,"Yeah, well maybe you can offer to pay for half of it instead?"
16453,That's terrible! Did you say anything about it?
16454,"Yeah, I would be too. Hopefully they'll invite you in the future."
16455,"Oh no, is it a young dog or an older one?"
16456,"Right, puppies are like that. It took mine a year and a half before they weren't having any more accidents like that."
16457,"It's really nice that you feel that way, even though you wanted it. Think you'll get it next time?"
16458,"Well, it certainly sounds like you deserve it. You sound like a good person."
16459,That's awesome. Debt really is an awful thing.
16460,Glad all that hard work paid off for ya. I aspire to get there someday myself.
16461,"Oh wow, that's great.  What unit are you in now and what made you want to change?"
16462,That's awesome.  Are you a nurse?  I used to work in the NICU.  It was a wonderful job.  Good luck with your new position.
16463,Wow! That is pretty amazing IMO..unless she isn't good with kids..My first almost killed me..and I am terrified to do it again..
16464,"Aw well, as long as she is a good mom, more power too her :) Children are great fun."
16465,Oh no. What's going on?
16466,I'm sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about changing your diet and exercise routine?
16467,Did you at least study?
16468,Nice. How long did that take you to learn?
16469,That's really great. You should go join the circus.
16470,Must've been a good burp.
16471,Must've gave them a good chuckle. Don't worry. They'll get over it.
16472,Oh man. Was she mad?
16473,"Dang. Well, I am sure you won't make that mistake in the future!"
16474,I bet.  I love fast food soooo much.  What did you have?
16475,"It really does.  I feel your pain on the no wheat policy.  I used to eat fast food all of the time and now I am a no wheat no oil vegan, so No fast food."
16476,"I'm not celiac, but I just eat whole food plant based.  It has been hard for me because I also hate vegetables (not good for a vegan) but I drink a lot of fresh vegetable juices and whole food smoothies to get the nutrients in.  I feel so much better now, though, that I can't go back.  Check out the Happy Pear on youtube, they have great vegan recipes."
16477,"I am very sorry to hear all of that, it is a little more expensive, but I found I feel so much better I can actually work more o make up the difference.  Check out Dr. Michael Greger, too if you haven't he is a great resource as well."
16478,Oh no!! When did this happen?
16479,"Oh, I feel you! I used to be a food addict as well when I was younger. It is a hard habit to break! It's amazing how far you have come though! So many don't realize that fresh real food make a difference and you feel so good when you get real nutrition!"
16480,That's too bad! Do you know if you can buy a new one before the show?
16481,"Yea, maybe you can find an alternative. I lost a few shirts over the years before too, it's no fun."
16482,I wouldn't be able to keep a surprise like that!
16483,Sounds like you're ready to go!
16484,"Wow, that's quite the shift! Did you have any difficulties leaving things behind you?"
16485,"Best of luck to you, I hope everything works out great in the end!"
16486,Was the dog upset about something or was he/she just telling you whose boss?
16487,She probably bad mouthed you while out there.
16488,That's too bad. Maybe she will find a new one soon.
16489,That's always a plus. I am sure that will make the search less stressful.
16490,That's why I don't have carpeting.
16491,That's really nice! Did you guys reconnect?
16492,It's always great to reconnect to old friends.
16493,Fear when you are a child can be so gripping.  What were you afraid of?
16494,That is really terrifying.
16495,That is really mean. Why does she do it?
16496,"I would too if my wife did that. It's alright, man."
16497,That's unfortunate! What style food did your favorite restaurant serve?
16498,"Dim sum, huh? I haven't heard of that before. What exactly is that?"
16499,Where did you take her?
16500,What did she eat on your date?
16501,I'm sorry to hear that. Are you saving more?
16502,Yea. You should definitely hold off on buying a new car for now.
16503,Oh my god!! she must have been raised in a barn!
16504,Like a bathroom maybe!  some people really just dont understand manners.
16505,"Haha, that's funny you mention that. I seen the same thing happen to a girl when I was at the grocery story one time."
16506,"Yeah, it must be a pretty embarrassing moment. Although it's an honest mistake.  "
16507,You have one as a pet?
16508,"That's great, losing a pet would have been awful."
16509,"Yeah, I sometimes do that as well. But, as long as the bills are getting paid, I guess you can't complain."
16510,"True. But, you can't help stupid people from getting high paying jobs. I am a prime example."
16511,Is the first time that he ran away?
16512,Then it is a little bit scary. Did you try to find him?
16513,That sounds awesome! Have you guys been friends long?
16514,That's pretty cool. You guys must have a good relationship. 
16515,I wish you luck anyway!
16516,That's disgusting! Why are cats so rude?
16517,I hope that that was the last time you have to clean up any messes! Sending my prayers!
16518,"I would like to come there and see it, how are you doing it?"
16519,I haven't actually. Have you?
16520,I've heard good things about the Navy and also how tough it is.
16521,That's awesome! Good luck on your finals!
16522,Don't forget to get some rest though.
16523,Nice! What kind of food do they serve?
16524,That sounds incredibly tasty. I think I will have to go there.
16525,That's so kind of you!
16526,aw I'm so happy for it. Do you miss it?
16527,"Wow, that's pretty nice of her. I wish my girlfriend would cook for me!"
16528,Yes she certainly does! I guess she makes up for it in other ways!
16529,They sound great! Happy birthday to you!
16530,I think that's normal. What were you afraid of?
16531,Must've been really terrifying. What did your parents do?
16532,That is so sad. What happened to her mom?
16533,That is really said. I hope that she gets a new mom some day.
16534,I am sure you did fine. Did you study hard?
16535,It will be fine! You'll be staring at an A before you know it!
16536,Oh my that does sound really relaxing. The weather was nice?
16537,That's great. I'm glad you got to feel that feeling.
16538,"That is no fun! I have been feeling lonely lately too, Where are your frineds?"
16539,That is lame! what was their excuse?
16540,Oh no! Does she have any applications outstanding?
16541,True. Sometimes you have to lower your standards to something more realistic.
16542,That's kinda sad. Is he studying or something?
16543,"Yeah, pushing herself could end up to her having a horrible life."
16544,I would've been angry.
16545,That's funny and also kind of a waste of pizza.
16546,They sound very helpful and caring! Would you take their classes again?
16547,Awesome! That makes me glad that there are still teachers and professors that truly care!
16548,I hope it turns out well whatever it is.
16549,She is a saint!
16550,I don't know how anyone could turn an abused child away..it's not easy but they need help.
16551,Whoa that's terrible. Did the police catch the robber?
16552,Yes I would be too. I hope you catch them and I hope he didn't loose too much stuff.
16553,"Thats a strong relationship , im happy to hear people like you still exist in this world"
16554,"thats disgusting , then why even be in a relationship waisting someones time"
16555,Nice! Was it tasty?
16556,I love having that feeling. Especially after eating a healthy snack!
16557,"Oh lord, I bet! Do you start early and what is it?"
16558,That's comical. Most of us don't reach 90.
16559,That happened to someone else today too! That is a bummer but is she just a puppy?
16560,That is good. You are better then me..I rescue but I would hate having that on something new.
16561,That's kinda creepy. What do you think happened to him?
16562,Hmmmm...Maybe he just went on vacation?
16563,Wow. Where ya going?
16564,"I don't think the polar bears are gonna let you near their coke, man."
16565,That's really neat. What kind of dance was it?
16566,"Wow, sounds pretty impressive!"
16567,How long ago was this?
16568,where did they go
16569,oh .. do they visit often? 
16570,Your car door?
16571,Was it parked at home? That sucks
16572,was it tax free weekend?
16573,ah.. that sounds like a smart move.
16574,Wow really? That's interesting. And yet he still teaches? 
16575,I guess he really does do it for the passion of teaching then.
16576,That's good to hear. What's going on?
16577,"It's good to reunite with them again, hu?"
16578,That's pretty awesome. Do you usually run marathons?
16579,Glad your hard work paid off. Was this marathon for a good cause?
16580,"That's a really good idea, smart thinking! "
16581,Well hopefully nothing bad will happen and you won't need to use it.
16582,"Oh no, do you know what caused it?"
16583,Oh god. I'm guessing they didn't take responsibility?
16584,oh wow.. do you think they can handle it?
16585,thats a good idea then if she can manage it 
16586,"Sorry to hear that! Losing pets is tough, it's essentially losing a family member."
16587,I hope you find the peace that you deserve and know your pet loved you!
16588,Wow! That is awesome!
16589,Will he be in school this year?
16590,That is nice. How old is she?
16591,That is awesome.
16592,"Oh, pity. Speak with them daily."
16593,I'm away from my family for the past 10 years.
16594,That's good to hear. Have they been there for you in the past?
16595,That's so kind of them. I'm glad you're repaying their kindness.
16596,were you able to make it up?
16597,oh good luck!
16598,What. Are they still viable?
16599,Will you get a refund?
16600,I hope you did a really great job.
16601,That's all you can do at this point 
16602,That was so nice of her! What kind of food?
16603,"Wow, that's impressive. A very exotic dish for sure!"
16604,Tennis? I am terrible at that game
16605,Well if you were playing me you would definitely win
16606,That sounds like fun. Do you not go out with them anymore?
16607,Hey being single isn't that bad! You'll find your soulmate one day when the time is right.
16608,"i would feel the exact same way , how come it did not work ?"
16609,"that is a little aggravating , i would be pissed too "
16610,it is a great time of the year
16611,i agree.
16612,"Ooh, cool, what are you gonna do while they're away? "
16613,"Nice, sounds like a relaxing weekend."
16614,Sorry to hear that. What were you upset about?
16615,"A C is not too bad. I know how you feel, I hold myself to a very high standard as well. It could have been much worse though!"
16616,Oh no that's so dangerous. Are you okay?
16617,"Yes, I would be too. That was so irresponsible of them!"
16618,That's very nice of you. I hope you guys have a great time!
16619,I'm sure it will go well! What are you cooking?
16620,Sorry to hear that. Sounds like sleep for you might not be in the cards tonight?
16621,I'm hoping for a miracle for you so that you can get a little bit of shut eye!
16622,That is nice. Do you take them frequently?
16623,That is a good surprised.
16624,Oh no! I hate to hear that! Have you found another place yet?
16625,Well I think you'll be able to sell it for a good price.
16626,"its funny what one saves , i saved a mickey mouse that was given to me while i was in the hospital things like 20 years old lol"
16627,"good times , you got to hold on to the memories "
16628,That's why they are being replaced by machines lol
16629,I thought I had seen every episode of lock down. I haven't seen that lol
16630,Oh no! I hope she's ok. Have you taken her to the vet?
16631,I hope she does too. Maybe spend extra time loving on her tonight she she'll feel better.
16632,I hope so too. Stay inside just in case.
16633,I hate lightning. It makes me jump every time.
16634,Won't you visit?4
16635,"Oh man, that always leads to trouble for me lol"
16636,"They probably changed their crust or something, they always do that mess."
16637,"I know right. I was never truly explained the world of ""bills"""
16638,"me too , but i had a long day at work and right now im just relaxing in the cold air for a little bit longer "
16639,that sounds like a great plan honestly 
16640,That's wonderful. It always feels good to pay off debt I think.
16641,"Yes, you must be very proud for accomplishing that."
16642,Whats goin on?
16643,That should be fun. I have to work this weekend. I need to hang with friends before I go crazy
16644,Bedtimes can be really hard for the kids and the adults too. LOL
16645,"Oh no, I have to take her side now. Summer's are made to break the rules."
16646,6
16647,The place didn't fall apart did it?
16648,"Well, that has never happened to me. I never think about work when I'm not there lol"
16649,"yeah thats annoying , its happened to me before"
16650,i used rope from the warehouse once as a belt 
16651,"That's how it works, for most of us lol"
16652,If only they had told us sooner.
16653,Did you usually visit them?
16654,That's cool! Are you gonna go all out with decorations and things?
16655,Are you nervous? I'm sure they're gonna love you.
16656,Then throw the whole dude away and get you a new one! You deserve the best!
16657,That is a real bummer. I hope you got a security deposit. They won't be getting that back.
16658,Make sure to leave feedback on their profile. Hopefully they can't get any more rentals.
16659,I am sure nothing will happen to you.
16660,"I understand. Sometime, I become also superstitious."
16661,Did you flip out?
16662,That's true. Were the questions even important?
16663,From you drinking it or someone taking it?
16664,I think it's time to hide your drinks from them. It works. That is what my Mom did when I was a kid.
16665,Are you concerned about aomething?
16666,Think positively. Stressing yourself out can definitely cause a problem
16667,"That's always fun, the kids always love it so much"
16668,Probably so but they'll remember it in the future and have fond memories.
16669,Oh no! Are you okay? 
16670,"It's okay, everyone makes mistakes sometimes. I hope the other driver is okay."
16671,"Oh no, about what?"
16672,"Oh no, I've been there done that too many times."
16673,OH no
16674,You won't believe how many times that has happened to me
16675,"that is really fun to do, waht did you buy?"
16676,i really like going once a month to buy something i really want helps with my anxiety
16677,Oh no! I can only imagine how that would have felt! How old was it?
16678,Aww that's so sad! But it's good to know she will be remembered
16679,"Yay! I am excited for you,  Have you known her long?"
16680,"HAHA I see I see,  Thats good! I hope it goes well and you fall in love"
16681,dont we all :)
16682,Seems one would know where that kept such precious things
16683,I never got into the pokemon craze
16684,Well that will be fun for you guys!
16685,"Oh no, I hate to hear that. Did he have a good reason?"
16686,I have been thinking about it too. ITs hard out here
16687,I know right. Especially for women.
16688,Awe I love weddings! Were they having a big wedding or a small one?
16689,You will when the time is right and it'll be beautiful.
16690,I love it when I something takes you back to yesterday. It's just so nostalgic and that can be a great feeling.
16691,So true. Whenever it happens I just close my eyes and embrace it.
16692,that does sound terrible
16693,I don't know if I should laugh or cry or both on the one lol
16694,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. Hopefully his demise showed someone out there that drinking is bad and made them change their life."
16695,Alright! is that a big money promotion for them?
16696,Thats great! did yall go out and celebrate?
16697,Did you cry?
16698,Well it looks like you survived!
16699,Do you mean that literally or are you just ready to move?
16700,Don't give up. I know it can be discouraging when your trying so hard. But it will happen.
16701,Im not sure if that's good or bad.
16702,I am so afraid of coasters.
16703,That is very unlikely. Thats what they say.
16704,Would you believe I have never seen one episode of that show? How sad that it's ending before I even got to watch it!
16705,"Well don't tell me what happens, I might just go watch it all now lol"
16706,stuff like that makes me wonder if they had been talking to each other the whole time
16707,"i feel you , but you will find someone better and he downgraded lol"
16708,I've never seen that but I love a good tear jerker!
16709,I'll have to check it out this weekend. Anything about the holocaust makes me cry.
16710,That's a smart move! Good thinking!
16711,That's so nice of you to help them out! I'm sure they're really thankful.
16712,Where are their parents?
16713,Call the police. I would. 
16714,Well. hope you score high.
16715,"Yeah, It is!"
16716,Oh really? And why is that?
16717,"Wow, any reason for that?"
16718,I hate that feeling. Are you still feeling that way now?
16719,"Well I'm glad you found your friends, that's a terrible way to feel. I've been there before."
16720,That was a crappy thing to do. Better get a handle on it now or it could become a big problem.
16721,They probably deserve it but you know the old saying two wrongs don't make a right.
16722,OH no. Is that a good thing?
16723,My daughter will be 14 this year. You just made me feel old lol
16724,"Oh man, honey buns are the best snack cake ever!"
16725,I'm the same way. I'll eat them in the car on the way home sometimes lol
16726,"Wow, nice! Congratulations that. You must have worked hard."
16727,I hope it was all worth it for this moment. Good job!
16728,"That's sad, are you throwing them a going away party?"
16729,Well I'm sure they'll like that and I bet they're gonna miss you too.
16730,Who chose the place?
16731,Cool. I love italian. Real italian.
16732,That's because you worked hard and never gave up! I'm proud of you!
16733,One day you'll be able to. Just keep your head up!
16734,Someone was recording him from the shadows
16735,I wish I could do one
16736,They make me sad too. I wish I could heal all those sick kids.
16737,It makes me feel better knowing that they get such great care at St Jude's and the parents never get a bill though.
16738,You must have been terrified. Did you see it happen?
16739,That is so awful. Was he a the victim of a crime or was it some type of accident?
16740,I would have been so scared. What did you do?
16741,Did you ever find out who he was?
16742,"Oh ok, I hope you are enjoying it. Why only one receiver?"
16743,Well that was a good choice then! It will save you some money too i'm sure
16744,It's about time then. Maybe now you will be able to get the back payments too.
16745,It's hard to depend on it. Don't figure it into your billing. That way if he doesn't pay it can't hurt you.
16746,I could never do that.
16747,You couldn;t stay at work until the next day. My job requires security to walk females out when its late.
16748,"wow, You didnt want to be around them that bad?"
16749,"LOLOL thats actually hilarious,  I guess thats why its ex now lol"
16750,uh. maybe its not something that important
16751,OH. I get it. Thats good then
16752,Those are so much fun. Family or school?
16753,"That will be great. Take lots of pictures, you will want to remember all of those memories you are going to make."
16754,Makes sense
16755,Yep. That always happens
16756,I only wear shorts!
16757,I would try and just wear shorts!
16758,"On christmas morning, I got everything I wanted."
16759,Really? 
16760,All of them?
16761,In your jeans you did?
16762,What?
16763,Well thats cute
16764,Join the club
16765,I have never seen a movie before
16766,I wish one day i could see it.
16767,"thats good,  I think all children need that.  I did when I was a child!"
16768,Haha! that is no good you must have gotten no sleep.
16769,Why didn't you drink water?
16770,RC Cola lol. I havent had that is years
16771,"That is terrible, have you told him how bad that will be?"
16772,Maybe you should get married!
16773,Well that terrible
16774,I always wear shorts everywhere.
16775,Thats the way to go about it!
16776,Did they get your shorts too?
16777,Call the police
16778,That was sweet. Did you eat together?
16779,She sounds like a keeper
16780,How do you feel about that? Are you ready?
16781,"Oh I see. Speeches always make me a bit nervous too... but once you start, it gets less worrisome I think."
16782,is there still a chance to get any??
16783,"oh my gosh,  kids refuse to sleep, i feel like i kind of do that as an adult too though"
16784,Well thats a positive spin
16785,Food solves lots of things lol
16786,I wish i had kids.
16787,I think they would make my life worth living.
16788,I don't like them either
16789,Lol okay then!
16790,I went to college for a few years.
16791,I did not like college much
16792,I thik thats good
16793,Why do want to fight?
16794,Yes! that can be once of the best times of the week.
16795,yes! are you going to a fancy restaurant ??
16796,Packing lunch saves money
16797,Ipack my kids luch

16834,"Wow, he was high on alcohol! I hope he didnt hurt anybody."
16835,are you scared of them or why do you run from them?
16836,"i enjoy a little rain every once in a while, but i dont like thunderstorms either "
16837,"Oh, did you check what could be that?"
16838,Do you believe in ghost? 
16839,Whats wrong?! is he not obeying your rules?
16840,"That is not good,  He need to learn he has to respect you."
16841,That is great. What game was it?
16842,Did you get a trophy?
16843,"Oh my god, Are you doing okay? What hapened?"
16844,Oh my god.  I hate when people are so careless.
16845,That would have to stop immediately or that shovel might be used for something else.
16846,If he won't stop you may need to take a picture of him doing it and then contact the authorities.
16847,"Yes, Life moves so fast its truly hard to believe some times."
16848,"I couldn't agree more,  Sometimes It feels like I was a little kid just yesterday."
16849,"I know what you mean, I don't even bother at this point."
16850,Exactly the same for me. Don't let it bother you too much.
16851,"Awe that is sweet, was it a special occasion?"
16852,That is good! just a reminder that you have a father that loves you.
16853,"Yes! That is the worst, I feel like my time is being wasted."
16854,"I say just keep putting yourself out there, cant give up."
16855,What was the big day then?
16856,"Oh cool, I hope it goes well!"
16857,thats pretty cool
16858,wow thats crazy
16859,"I would say that is one of life simple joys, not a care in the world."
16860,I try to do that as often as I possibly can.
16861,"that is not cool, what where you guys planning to do"
16862,"if he had other things to do it is ok, but i hate when people  cancel just beacuse they are sleeping haha"
16863,I have no friend at all.
16864,Maybe try a bar with food!
16865,What did you do with the money?
16866,What was it? Was it clothing?
16867,"Yes! life is a blessing, and we need to make the most of every day."
16868,God is good to people.  He is always there for you.
16869,I would have thrown up!
16870,I would have left the entire house!
16871,Did you take any medicine?
16872,They want you to take their medicines?
16873,Maybe try and watch tv or play games.
16874,Maybe go outside and try and eat dirt.
16875,I guess because they are healthy and don't taste that bad.
16876,Really? Must be some bad peas.
16877,Maybe they found a lover to share life with.
16878,That changes everyone's life.
16879,It's a good feeling when you are successful after you have worked so hard. 
16880,The way you felt should be motivation to keep up the good work.
16881,oh really i bet i would be too
16882,that is the most beautiful thing ive ever heard
16883,that is a great plan!
16884,I would cry if anyone i know died.

16886,That must of been scary.
16887,Where are you staying right now?
16888,I am also looking for a better job.
16889,"I mow lawns for a living, and it is so hot."
16890,I'm sorry to hear that. What will you do now?
16891,Like in Community! You'll have a great time and I'm sure everything will work out well.
16892,I prefer New York style pizza.
16893,"That is not cool of them, did they have a good reason?"
16894,well anyways it is really bad on their part that they did that
16895,Did you get them to recook it?
16896,i agree.they are not taking my guns!
16897,i  agrere
16898,oh yea? whats that.
16899,"oh thats nice, wish i was doing something similar"
16900,Oh I hate it when that happens!
16901,I tend to get road rage and lay on my horn at times like those.
16902,Yeah? Why was that?
16903,Good. I loved school too.
16904,I wish i was one of those people.
16905,If i could make more money for less work i would any day.
16906,Oh no! How fast were you going?
16907,Harsh. How much is the fine?
16908,That is great news. How did the interview go?
16909,Who is the interview with?
16910,"oh wow that is horrible, im sorry for your loss"
16911,wow thats young
16912,Are you in college or high school?
16913,What was your last job then?
16914,Sounds like an interesting job. I hope you get that job that you're looking for.
16915,Was it with close friends?
16916,And nothing bad happened?
16917,Thats a good plan. Did the snow and ice come?
16918,Like the Boy Scouts - Always Be Prepared.
16919,There is not enough money to get me to do that. My sister likes those kind of shows and I watch with her sometimes.
16920,OMG! Were you grossed out?
16921,Oh that's terrible. Was he busy with something else?
16922,Ah I see. Must have slipped his mind while he was hard at work.
16923,Do you know who did it?
16924,have you thought  about saving money?
16925,"Yeah it is hard for some people to save money, for me it is kind of hard not to spend what i have"
16926,I honestly hope they do not.
16927,I'm more of a football fan!
16928,That must of been embarrassing.
16929,wow that is crazy? did he?
16930,good thing it ended well
16931,"Wow! I don't know much about baseball, but I know Babe Ruth. New York Yankees, wasn't he? The house that Ruth built."
16932,I'm sure he'll love that. It must be quite valuable.
16933,"Wow, that is really tall."
16934,Are you done growing?
16935,"I am not sure what that is, but I wish you luck with it."
16936,"That is actually nice, i like rock music."
16937,Amazing! Were you close when you were young?
16938,I'm glad you got back in touch then. 
16939,I see. How was the show?
16940,It sounds like an important film. I love watching documentaries.
16941,What kind of pen are you talking about?
16942,What do you write with it? Do you write a letter or a book or a shopping list?
16943,I am not American so I am only vaguely aware of them.  They are an American new channel is that right?
16944,What a lovely aunt. You must be her favorite nephew or niece
16945,Maybe she tried to bring some warm strings in relationship with you
16946,"Oh no. It happened to me recently. But, I take the4 view that things like that happen for a good reason and you'll end up in a better position down the line."
16947,I am in exactly the same boat. I'm still searching for a new job. It's tough. But stay positive - it might not happen!
16948,"That's so funny! I mean, that must have been embarasing!"
16949,Such a shame. Were you very young?
16950,I love pizza. Did you make it by yourself or with friends?
16951,Were you the only one who are it?
16952,Really? why?
16953,Who is he that you are speaking about?
16954,Do you want your friend to change?
16955,I'm in the UK - when is Labor day? 
16956,Wow! That'll be amazing!
16957,That is a good thing. How long have you been with them?
16958,That is a long time. Why not get married?
16959,Will you not be sad to leave him?
16960,That's a good way to be.
16961,wow. i would also fee sad
16962,Oh that's exciting! When are they coming?
16963,That's excellent! I bet you two will have an amazing time!
16964,What are you making for the dinner?
16965,Will you make any dessert?
16966,Really? Lot's of people seem to disagree with that
16967,Good - I'm sure he will be good for the business side of things.
16968,"Was it delivered by Fed Ex, UPS or by the US Postal?"
16969,I have never heard of them. What was in the parcel?
16970,Oh no! Why not?
16971,Can it not be rearranged?
16972,Who is your favorite team?
16973,Oh me too. Social cues seem to get lost so easily on people these days.
16974,My pleasure. It needs to be said. 
16975,"i love the becah, im there every weekend"
16976,i live like 10 min away

16979,5 eh? Good - that's my favourite number!
16980,Thanks again! 
16981,Why did you get angry?
16982,That isn't good. Did you speak to a manager?

16984,Sorry - I mashed the keyboard. When is the UFC on?
16985,any special plans?
16986,ive always wanted to go on a cruise
16987,How old was sammy?
16988,I am sure you had good times. Will you get another dog?
16989,"wow, they must be really tasty for you to have done that"
16990,"You will be fine buddy. Type therapy for stoping cookie addiction on youtube, I am sure you will find something helpful there"
16991,Great! Why are you so happy today?
16992,Brilliant! SO the summer starts now for you?
16993,Wow! I hope so. Are you going to ask them today?
16994,Good plan. Why are you so confident?
16995,Why were you not allowed to go?
16996,Did you return the item?
16997,How long will that take to happen?
16998,do you have a special plan?
16999,im sure he will love it!!!1
17000,Were you expecting the parcel?
17001,What was inside the parcel?
17002,Really? Why? Out of happiness?
17003,"Good point. But maybe, just maybe, it'll be brilliant."
17004,That's a great attitude to have.
17005,It sounds like you are very content. That's great!
17006,Yeah - what kind of work do you do?
17007,Good - it makes a big difference if you can enjoy your work.
17008,OH no! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you alright?
17009,Have you got plenty of people around to support you?
17010,why was that? what hppened
17011,ohhh..sounds super awkward
17012,Well done! Did you buy all the parts separately?
17013,Did you find it difficult?
17014,Yeah - I've done it a few times and it's much easier than most people think. Still impressive though
17015,Make sure you dress nicely and bring a positive attitude.  
17016,Yeah no problem.  Make sure to do a mock interview with a friend or family member to practice what you will say.
17017,Is this your first job?
17018,What's wrong with the job you have now since you have been there for 21 years?  Must not be too bad.
17019,what were you expecting
17020,hahah...thats too funny
17021,Oh no. Disgusting! 
17022,That's a funny image. 
17023,What kind of cookies?
17024,Were they as delicious as they sound?
17025,Were they chocolate covered cookies or chocolate flavored?
17026,Man I'm starting to get a little hungry.
17027,Wow. Were you hungry or just feeling like a treat?
17028,They must have been delicious cookies!
17029,thats really cool!what did she compete in?
17030,wow! 17 catagories!! thatis a lot!
17031,When is it?
17032,How old is he then - 3?
17033,"Oh my, that doesn't sound good. Whats happening?"
17034,You should not tolerate that discrimination. I think you should complain to HR.
17035,"Well done, it must have been quite an experience"
17036,Maybe the baby is feeling you :) and knows that you two are related
17037,Hm delicious. Do you feel proud of yourself?! 
17038,Good work. Make some for me too!
17039,Oh my gosh! Really? That's terrible.
17040,What did the manager say?
17041,how did it come out?
17042,what did you put on it?
17043,Scary. Did you investigate?
17044,Phew! That's a relief!
17045,Hm that sounds suspicious. Where do you think it went?
17046,Do you feel afraid that there might be a ghost in the house?
17047,Nice! Well done. What is the occasion?
17048,Does she know you are going to be better groomed though? Maybe she liked that shagginess!
17049,That must be so annoying. You should ask for a pay raise.
17050,"I see, time to switch companies! "
17051,Oh no. Were you alright?
17052,I know. Maybe get a cab next time!
17053,I guess thats because he's in a higher position of seniority? 
17054,That is aggravating. You should tell him that you need to get a higher pay for your work!
17055,Amazing. Was there any scares?
17056,That's cool. You live in teh future now.
17057,That's a nice thought. Your wife I take it?
17058,I wish I could fidn someone like that
17059,"that's great, what's in the package?"
17060,"Oh, I guess you got a new boyfie. Chocolates are most often used to show love"
17061,They are really cool looking animals!
17062,Are they friendly or aloof?
17063,Really? No-one? Why not?
17064,I understand that. Did you send out invites?
17065,Oh sorry to hear that. How come?
17066,I am sure he/she understood you were just nervous. You should make it up to them. 
17067,i would have also. we always want to give our kids the best
17068,"yes, unfortunately it happens"
17069,how did that happen
17070,ah well that would be a good reason then
17071,"Nice, do you feel nervous about it?"
17072,So you must have prepared well for it. I hope you get the job!
17073,Amazing. Is that even legal though?
17074,That's cool. Were you scared?
17075,Yeah - do you think it went well then?
17076,Good. I hope you do. When will you find out?
17077,oh thats a good friend
17078,Why his pay was so big?
17079,Then clarify this with any senior 
17080,what happend after that?
17081,wow. for some candy? harsh 
17082,You must be feeling kinda lonely. Have you tried joining any meetup groups?
17083,Good idea. Check to see if there any groups on facebook of your interest.
17084,oh wow that's kind of gross
17085,I don't know if I could even eat a squid if it was fully cooked
17086,thats a great father!
17087,you're the favorite 
17088,"Oh my, do you know where the dent came from?"
17089,Sorry to hear that. I hate when people do that and not even leave a note owning up.
17090,I can't answer that! You seem lonely.
17091,I hope not. Try to have an enjoyable life regardless
17092,Yeah? - whats the job?
17093,Really? That's interesting. Have you done it before or is this a completely new type of career?
17094,i must have missed that one
17095,ah yea i can only imagine
17096,how did that go? did you have fun?
17097,did he start anything?
17098,Why did you sell them?
17099,Scary! Did you figure out what it was?
17100,Wow I'm glad it wasn't something scary lol
17101,Do you have a new job?
17102,Wow. Big step.
17103,"Haha I've done that. She was probably holding in a fart, too."
17104,"Everyone farts, man. It's ok."
17105,That's crap! Do you know what caused it?
17106,Scumbag. Will it be expensive to fix?
17107,im sure it wasnt as bad as you imagined it in your head unless other people watching the movie told you to hush
17108,I know how you feel. You don't have to let go of them because the value you place on them can be carried forward for generations and that will make them priceless
17109,"That is good, so you must have prepared well for it."
17110,I hope it goes well for you. Hard work tends to pay off!
17111,I didn't know they still toured. I saw Korn years ago.
17112,expecting something special?
17113,that is always a great day!!!
17114,I would have been too. How did it happen?
17115,That has happened to me before. So aggravating! 
17116,whattttttt....... why did he do that
17117,im sorry to hear that ... hopefully he gets help to deal with issues
17118,Really? In what way?
17119,Nice. I suppose you get what you pay for.
17120,"don't think about it, what is done is done, just anticipate that they will call you back, the universe have it's way of helping if we believe "
17121,Yes that's the spirit :)
17122,It
17123,It is always nice to have someone by your side when you need it
17124,Really? why the delay?
17125,So sorry about that
17126,I would have totally screamed! Were you alone? What did you do?
17127,I bet it did. I'm glad you were able to figure out what it was and hopefully you got some sleep afterwards.
17128,Who was there?
17129,So you just went back to sleep/
17130,That's a good one
17131,"That sounds like a plan! Who said that, might I ask?"
17132,Words of wisdom from him. Will you follow his advice?
17133,Do you think you might get it?
17134,Than I think you have little to worry about.
17135,How did it go than?
17136,"Of course it was, but next time you'll handle it better."
17137,Ha! Do you feel guilty nor or what?!
17138,Exactly! but its okay to cheat a little every now and then!
17139,Oh no! what happened after?
17140,"Wow I'm sorry you went through that. Not your fault, it happens"
17141,Because nobody taught them how to live right.
17142,"Government? No way, it is interested in quite the opposite my friend."
17143,That is really good of you. Hopefully he doesnt decide to stay at your house forever!
17144,"Nice, I wish I had a friend like that!"
17145,did you just start the job?
17146,i would also feel lonely
17147,"man that would have scared me too, was it an actual intruder?"
17148,that is too funny but I have done things like that before as well
17149,Did your younger brother let it out or something like that?
17150,"Yes, this things happen, but as long as you find your dog after, it's alright."
17151,Cool
17152,"Ouch, I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are ok?"
17153,"Well, I think you should get a new one "
17154,You can ask your best friends if they have a spare before spending money on a new one though
17155,that's great! it's good to be supportive of your partner
17156,she sounds like a great person
17157,"oh wow, are you paying for her classes?"
17158,I have 2 daughters myself and hope that they get scholarships

17176,"That's great, good for you for taking charge of the situation "
17177,"I think it's so important to not let things like that bother us, I'm really pleased for you. "
17178,Good job! You must feel so proud of yourself! 
17179,You should go out for dinner and celebrate!
17180,"I agree, are you sure you're buying the right groceries? "
17181,Why is that? May I ask.
17182,"I know how you feel, you don't have to sell it buddy"

17196,"I'm sorry, is it because their guitarist died?"
17197,"At least they are making an album, that's cool."
17198,I'm sorry to hear that... don't blame yourself
17199,Hopefully he opens his eyes soon and realizes what he is doing
17200,I think it's time to call the animal protection unit

17203,Do you work for the government now?
17204,yea i can understand that
17205,That's good. It means you will be on vacation and having fun
17206,oh ok. it's good to catch up on old times with foreign friends
17207,"I am not married, so I am not sure."
17208,Where do you go to meet women?
17209,No way! I'd be so upset.... how did she react?
17210,that's horrible
17211,Ouch! Sorry to hear that! Are you mad at him?
17212,I bet he does! But it was just an accident so hopefully you can forgive him. 
17213,"That is so cool, how does that make you feel?"
17214,"Yeah, those cars are really pricey."
17215,Oh poor dog! I hope he is okay!
17216,I am glad to hear that. I hate seeing animals suffer.
17217,That isn't good. Have you spoken to him about it?
17218,You should talk to him. I am sure he will pick up if you do.
17219,"I can understand that, it is scary."
17220,Oh that must have been traumatic.
17221,i would have been pissed too!
17222,i hope so too!
17223,oh wow.. that stinks
17224,hopefully you had insurance
17225,That is very nice of your friend.
17226,"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that"
17227,Same here... it really sucks
17228,"Oh no, is your dog okay?"
17229,I hope your dog is found safe.
17230,did he catch you
17231,well at least you were unharmed!
17232,I bet that must have taken you back to the good old days?
17233,Any particular memory stand out that you care to share?
17234,Glad to hear it. Did you get to relax at home?
17235,Oh that must have been nice. It always cheers me up when my kids visit from college.
17236,oh no!! did she find out about it?
17237,that is such sad news
17238,That is so sad. Did you comfort him?
17239,That is so caring of you! Good on you for being a good Samaritan! 
17240,Ah! That must be so frustrating. You should speak to him about this.
17241,I would be too. I want my paper on time!
17242,I hope that never happens again.
17243,wonder how it tastes 
17244,Why were you scared?
17245,"Yeah, the woods can be scary at night."
17246,That is so cool. You are so lucky to have been able to experience that.
17247,I hope you enjoyed every minute of that. It sounds like a once in a life time experience.
17248,Nothing like mom's cooking!
17249,That's when you know you had a good meal LOL
17250,That must so inconvenient! Are you having trouble falling asleep because of it?
17251,"Oh thats a blessing. As long as the baby is asleep, all is good! "
17252,Why were you scared to go home alone?
17253,That must be really annoying and scary.
17254,those were the days!
17255,this is true.
17256,whos mom?
17257,im sorry to hear that.
17258,Really? That is cool
17259,Why did you?
17260,those are some good coworkers!
17261,It's nice to work with people who care
17262,"I'm sorry, I hope you find it."
17263,I think you will be fine.
17264,"congratulations, you will be spending time with your loved one again"
17265,I hope you can propose marriage to her when you meet with her
17266,You must be quite confident in your abilities! 
17267,Good to hear. But don't get too overconfident! 
17268,"Oh my, did they let everyone else leave early except you?"
17269,I would be upset if that happened to me. I hope they let you off early next time.
17270,oh thats good.. dang kid!
17271,I hope you have a good time.
17272,wow that's horrible.. did you confront them>
17273,Tell me about the fun things
17274,Oh really? How'd you find out?
17275,Well at least you found out easily.
17276,"I love cats, they are the best."
17277,"Yes, cats can be difficult to take care of."
17278,I can understand 
17279,I though you went earlier to impress a girl
17280,Wow! That's amazing! I'd love it if my parents got me gifts like that!!
17281,I could imagine. Maybe I should drop some more hints.
17282,"That is good, its very important to have an instructor like that to calm your nerves. "
17283,He must have been very passionate about teaching his students.
17284,"Oh man, where customers upset with you?"
17285,Sucks how customers blame employees like it's their fault
17286,I hate when that happens but that is good they were quick to replace it. 
17287,Hopefully it wasn't something time important 
17288,Oh did he pass?
17289,"that's great, congratulations"
17290,did you look all over for them?
17291,thats good...they are usually ALWAYS in the last place you look.
17292,"Oh my goodness, that sounds absolutely terrifying. Do you think they would've hurt you if they found you?"
17293,"You'd probably be having even more nightmares. I'm glad you're safe, though."
17294,That's a unique experience to go through. Does she have a nice location picked out for it?
17295,Cool! That sounds really special and personal. I'm sure they both will really enjoy that!
17296,That is very nice of your sister!
17297,"Yeah, maybe you should get her a gift of some sort."
17298,I've never actually watched that show myself. But I've heard so many good things about it!
17299,I tend to like shorter shows that don't have these super long ongoing plots. So I do have a bit of interest but I'm not sure if it's really for e.
17300,"I'm sorry to hear that... it sucks being in a ""team"" where no one wants to do anything"
17301,I would confront them about it to avoid it happening again
17302,That's really exciting! Do you have any special plans for this weekend?
17303,Well that does sound like a restful and relaxing weekend. I love traveling on my off time!
17304,do you have roomates?
17305,mine does the exact same thing! i hate it
17306,Aww that had to be a little disappointing?
17307,Yeah that can be life changing money! Maybe next time!
17308,Old houses are the best.
17309,As a kid? That's the best!
17310,Did you go often with your family?
17311,"Oh, what is it?"
17312,That must be so exciting!
17313,oh no what did she say?
17314,I would have laughed lol
17315,You must be so proud. That really is a great accomplishment that he has made. Is he going to college?
17316,That is so awesome. Does he have a major picked out?
17317,was it an expensive one?
17318,awww...still thats upsetting
17319,Oh no! that's so scary
17320,haha silly cat!
17321,"Yeah, you can really get in major trouble for doing that."
17322,I would just not do it again.
17323,I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know why your neighbor does that to you?
17324,I think you should just continue talking over your neighbor. Maybe that will get your neighbor to stop.
17325,Who does she talk to on the phone regularly?
17326,So why does that make you discontented?
17327,I can imagine that would be a painful waiting period. Why do you belive she is unfaithful?
17328,I can see the why you would feel that way. I would be worried too.
17329,The good news is the chances of actually getting HIV is relatively low. You should not have to worry about it.
17330,I can imagine it would. You dont need that stress in your life.
17331,"Oh no, did it not turn out the way you planned?"
17332,That's awesome! Hard work always pays off!
17333,Don't be so negative about it. Maybe you'll really like the person.
17334,So then just let the person know you can't make it. There's no reason to waste that person's time.
17335,That's very good of you. I would be proud of myself If I can do such a thing especially if there is a huge chunk of money in it
17336,I hope he  or she rewarded you though
17337,That's great! What kind of car did you get?
17338,"Wow, that is a sweet ride!"
17339,"Oh no, what are going to do?"
17340,I hope they can fix your glasses.
17341,i hate when they forget the cheese
17342,i would have been too.. i love my cheese burgers
17343,That is nice to gave a friend that can help you in time of need.
17344,That is not good but my mistake happened.
17345,Sounds pretty incompetent to me.  Have you found a new one yet?
17346,It seems hard finding a good doctor these days.
17347,Congrats! It's great to pass your test. Though staying up all night to study may not be the best studying technique.
17348,That's good. I try to study well in advance. But I find it hard to actually motivate myself.
17349,haha that's funny! 
17350,I'm glad you survived lol
17351,That must be quite nostalgic.
17352,I miss the old times.
17353,is it a newer model?
17354,I'm sorry to hear that. It's really horrible when a friend backs out at the last second.
17355,There's always scalpers outside of concert venues. That could probably work.
17356,"Wow, what a forward woman."
17357,"Yeah, I'm sure you were."
17358,lol...thats harsh! are you?
17359,hahah...that is natural
17360,That's great you have that kind of confidence.
17361,That is very responsible of you.
17362,"first of all my condolences for your friend, and i know how hard this is for you both"
17363,"ya it feels so weak to be in that place , but you should only give the strength required for your friend to overcome this situation"
17364,"you can do it , i pray that you both overcome this situation with peace. "
17365,That's awful! Maybe you can pay them back?
17366,Oh wow that's tough. Hopefully they don't know it was you at least.
17367,That is bad. I hope you will find something interesting to do.
17368,"I understand. Probably, watching a new movie could be good idea."
17369,Oh yea? why is that?
17370,I wish there is a way we can make people care more about the environment
17371,"Oh no, im sorry to hear that"
17372,It happens... but you never know their situation and sometimes people make bad financial decisions
17373,That sounds so disgusting!
17374,I would have done that too.
17375,Why she want to divorce? Did she tell you?
17376,That is terrible. How did you find out?
17377,"Yikes, did you miss a payment?"
17378,"It shouldn't have, maybe you need to call customer service and question them as to why."
17379,I am sure you are beautiful too!
17380,I wish you had a higher self-esteem.
17381,Wow! I can imagine how joyous that feeling must have been!
17382,Congrats! That would be really stressful. I'm happy it all worked out for you.
17383,"Oh, no that isn't good. I""m sorry"
17384,Did he just freeze up on the test or was it different then the stuff you studied?
17385,i hope all goes well. was something the matter that made you decide to have the tests done?
17386,always good to check if in doubt
17387,Oh no I am so sorry! I bet that must have been scary too
17388,wow they should care more that youre safe!
17389,I love pizza. What style pizza does the place make?
17390,"Yeah, that sounds very exciting."
17391,Uhoh I hope you didn't get in trouble?
17392,Well you can use that feeling to make sure you don't do it again!
17393,That is terrible. What did you do?
17394,Well that is a good way to look at it.
17395,"That's great, trust is the backbone of all lasting relationships."
17396,"Of course, we're not meant to lock ourselves away alone for our entire lives."
17397,That is bad. Did you go to a doctor?
17398,Then nothing to worry about.
17399,I do too. It always brings back so many good memories.
17400,Yes it is. Sometimes I wish you could just go back to that time.
17401,I am sorry to hear that. Thieves are really crappy people.
17402,I hope they catch the person and you get your laptop back.
17403,Oh wow! Are you okay?
17404,That is insane.  Thank God there was someone there to intervene.
17405,Oh why is that? Do you play?
17406,"Ah, yeah my husband is the same way. He is very excited."
17407,"Good for him! That's a very valuable skill to have, good on you for teaching him so early."
17408,"Does he seem to enjoy being in the water, or does he resist you a bit?"
17409,Oh I know that feeling actually... Did you ever make up with your friend?
17410,"That's good to hear. It's all water under the bridge now, as they say."
17411,"That sounds like fun, what kind of movie will you see?"
17412,"Nice, I love those. I have seen a preview for a shark attack movie that is coming out. I think called Meg, I hope to see that sometime"
17413,"I love eating there, the food is always amazing."
17414,I am glad you had such a good meal.
17415,I hope it wasn't a close friend that lied.
17416,That is sad.  Liars and thieves are just the worst.
17417,I don't blame you.  A friend like that isn't a friend at all.  I'm sorry that has happened to you.
17418,"That's embarrassing, but also funny. How did your date react?"
17419,That is awesome that she didn't make a big scene of it!
17420,I understand. It could be little bit scary at first but it is fun.
17421,Aww :(  What did you end up doing instead?
17422,You could've always come on here and chat with other cool people like you :D
17423,"Oh no, are they going to be okay?"
17424,"Oh, that will be so fun!"
17425,"Oh my, I hope she is ok?"
17426,I would be too!  Was she at fault?
17427,Wow. It is very unsual to see that.
17428,Why? Do you want to do like him?
17429,That is so sweet of your child.
17430,He must be very smart!
17431,That's annoying! Did you end up eating it anyway?
17432,Sorry that you had a bad experience!
17433,"Wow, what's the special occasion?"
17434,"Yeah, that is going to be a lot of work, and hard to transport to your job."
17435,Aww was it your birthday or something?
17436,OOO Kid Rock that's one of my friends favorites!
17437,"I bet, its always nice to get a chance to work with someone you really like.  Where do you work?"
17438,That does suck.  I work at Taco Bell making burritos.
17439,You must be very proud of your new set of teeth
17440,Congrats you can smile freely now :)
17441,What preferences do you mean? You shouldn't have to say your truth to anyone.
17442,There's nothing wrong with that and it's a shame people even question you about that.
17443,Congratulations! When is the wedding?
17444,"I'm happy for you, I hope everything continues to work out!"
17445,Oh no! That is so sad for you.  How embarrassing. 
17446,how sad.  I am so sorry you had to deal with that.
17447,Oh no! Did you manage to avoid a stain?
17448,Don't feel ashamed. You'll be able to laugh about it soon enough!
17449,How did it went?
17450,That is terrible. What are going to do?
17451,"Oh god that sounds terrible! Are you okay, is everyone in your house okay? Did anyone get hurt?"
17452,I'm glad to hear that no one in your house got hurt. Gang crime needs to be stopped!
17453,I'm sorry that happened. Do you still have contact with him?
17454,"Cliche as it is, time heals all wounds and whatnot. I hope you can find somebody just as great as him or learn to be content on your own!"
17455,"That is horrible! Do you think it is really true, or she was trying to just make you angry? "
17456,You can always try to get a DNA test.
17457,Are you worried and nervous?
17458,I hope they do and everything is ok
17459,That is terrible.
17460,Who fault it was?
17461,Sorry to hear that. Is the feeling mutual?
17462,That is awful! Hopefully things work out for the better for you!
17463,"Oh my lord, I would have been terrified. Are you okay?"
17464,I am glad to hear you are okay.
17465,I feel you! Summer is great and all but I miss my classmates and the work I'm studying.
17466,I hope you have a successful semester!
17467,How did you do ?
17468,"Congratulations, I hope you get a raise."
17469,Oh. I hope you get it! 
17470,That's a pretty substantial raise! 
17471,Wow!  I would have been spooked about that too.  What did you do?
17472,are you?
17473,thats true.
17474,How fun! How did you all celebrate?
17475,That's really nice of you. Catfish sure sounds good to me right now!
17476,"Yeah, I remember mine as well. They were always a great time."
17477,"That sounds like so much fun, too bad those times had to ever end."
17478,WOW!  Congrats!  Was it hard contest?
17479,You must be very smart!
17480,Nice! what kind of car is it
17481,You're pretty lucky to have a boss like that haha
17482,"Oh goodness, that is terrible."
17483,"Yeah, delivery services have really fallen off."
17484,OMG!  How nasty!
17485,Did he at least offer to share with you?
17486,I'm sorry that happened. Maybe she was tired from working all day.
17487,"Oh, I understand. Have you talked to her about how you feel about it?"
17488,I have never had greek cuisine
17489,There aren't many restaurants where I live. Only fast food.
17490,"That is great, she will fit right in!"
17491,What an excellent way to start school!
17492,What are union memners points?
17493,Oh. Maybe they should lower the fees or up the rewards
17494,Sounds fun! What movie are you going to watch?
17495,Oh. Well that's lovely.. I suppose. Lol. Maybe you should amend the movie night rules with a different theme every time so they are more constrained to what they have to choose from! Haha!
17496,Nervous? That's interesting. Has anything changed recently? What are your thoughts on why it's happening?
17497,"I see. I'm sorry you're having trouble with that. Have you thought about therapy? Maybe your health insurance will cover a free consultation or something. Or perhaps you just need a simple routine change, with some exercise and more time outside. I hope you find the answer, whatever it is."
17498,"That was rough, how long ago was this ?"
17499,I'm sorry you had to endure this.
17500,"That's pretty nice. I'm in college, and I've had three different roommates so far, having to move three different times. Starting to get old. You truly lucked out!"
17501,"I hope you guys are able to keep in touch. With that kind of experience, it sounds like it could be a good friend for life. As we get older, we let those kinds of people slip through our fingers. Try to maintain it as best you can."
17502,That is too bad. What are you going to do? Was this your first time gambling?
17503,That is too bad that you had to learn a lesson that way. I am sorry.
17504,"It's nice that you tried to comfort him.  I'm worried about my parents, also.  It's hard to be worried about something like that in your family, knowing that you have no control over whether or not it will happen.  It's sad."
17505,"Agreed - it's very stressful.  I live half a country away from my parents, and I'm worried I won't be able to help when either of them need it.  "
17506,"I feel for you. My girlfriend is in the same position. Luckily we don't have kids to complicate things, but her job wears her out and it doesn't seem like she can physically or mentally keep up with it. Kids just make it so that you feel you have to do it until you die, no matter what."
17507,"At least it sounds like you're giving it a lot of thought. You sound resilient. Most people would just quit or get fired, or not even realize the negative impact it's putting on their children. You seem very self-aware, so I'm sure you will be able to figure out the best decision for everyone involved. Good luck!"
17508,That stinks. I'm sorry about that
17509,Omg I was about to say that is so mean and rude and I would be so embarrassed but I know it was a honest mistake I dislike the auto correct. 
17510,lol I hope your friend understood and they can still meet up or communicate and if things work out it's a funny to tell in the future. 
17511,What happens on Saturday?
17512,That sounds really cool. Have fun!
17513,I think it's about time you lay down some rules!
17514,Is this a roommate situation or are we talking about kids? 
17515,Oh my yeah I would have been pretty irritated! 
17516,"Yes it stinks when things just dont work out, but keep your head up, Im sure you will find someone you like that will be a big help to you!"
17517,Nice!  Six months is a long time to be car-less.  I'm sure you have a new sense of freedom to do what you want and need to do while he's at work now.
17518,"That's funny - true.  Hopefully the good part outweighs that, though.  "
17519,Well that still makes you a great friend! 
17520,"Sounds like you all should stay away from bars lol. But if it keeps you acting good at home, then so be it. Your friend sounds like he needs a crack too"
17521,That's cool.  What type of supplements
17522,That sounds pretty healthy.  Have you always been this health conscious
17523,Have you had trouble lately?
17524,I hope things go well for you too.
17525,Oh really? I hate winter though! I don't want that to arrive :)
17526,I prefer it over the winter if I have to make a choice
17527,It's nice that you have a meaningful item from her.  It's a pretty bittersweet feeling thinking about someone you loved who is gone.  
17528,"That's nice - it's nice that you have memories like that.  I only have a couple of items from my grandparents, and I treasure them. "
17529,That would take such toll one me. Just make sure they have enough to keep them occupied maybe.
17530,Might have to bring them to the park and tire them out. School should starting up soon.
17531,That's awesome! It's always pleasant to have a good day.
17532,Little surprises like that really bring a new meaning to life!
17533,"Oh, I hate it when that happens :( Have you looked on places like mercari or ebay?"
17534,Yes! I get makeup I need more than half off on those places
17535,I find this context hard to believe.
17536,"Oh geez! Really, that is interesting, but why would they want too!"
17537,Are you a cop yourself
17538,Dang whereabouts do you live man? I'm in South Texas sometimes cops are like that here too
17539,Well that is kind of you. They must really be going through something.
17540,That would be a lot to deal with. I hope things stay good for awhile.
17541,Oh god! I would be SO TICKED! Do they have cameras?
17542,That is AWFUL! My mom had that happen too- An old guy hit her atthe gas station and sped off! Seriously not fair!!
17543,Oh man that sounds horrible. I would probably faint.
17544,It must have hurt so much. 
17545,"Thats amazing,  I am sorry for your loss, But atleast you have a constant reminder of him."
17546,Thats so sweet.  He is probably looking down happy you are wearing it!
17547,"Oh no!, Did you ever end finishing it up in time?"
17548,"Thats good, I just finished studying for a final, And I barely finished in time!"
17549,Oh no that's terrible! Are you going to apply again?
17550,I understand. Maybe apply at a different bank this time.
17551,Woow. That is terrifying. Are you alright? Do you live in some rural areas?
17552,"Thankfully. Hearing your story, i am terrified now to even walk in my back yard anymore"
17553,"Yes, that always saddens me too. I see them now and then."
17554,"Yeah, there should be, but often there is not really a good option for them."
17555,Good for you.  Being honest is important.
17556,Sometimes that's the best way to learn
17557,The note is for what?
17558,"well, expect my note too,though it would be a soft copy"
17559,What country? If you don't mind sharing...I'm in South Texas and loving it :)
17560,I'm sure you'll meet some cool people if you find a good Pho restaurant!
17561,Wow she must really fancy you. You should ask her how she found you.
17562,What a random surprise. Just make sure its not some creepy stalker. 
17563,Oh that is so gross! I hate bugs too!
17564,I hope none of them found a way home with you.
17565,"Wow, so close to graduation!  What does he want to do after he graduates?"
17566,"Oh no!  I hope you're able to.  I know its hard for kids to look at the longer, bigger picture of life sometimes and just what he's going through now.  I took my GED early at 16 and graduated so maybe he wants to do that and start something else sooner."
17567,budget for what?
17568,You mean you have a budget for life?
17569,Maybe she has too much on her plate?
17570,Mistakes happen! I am sure people aren't too upset. I have numb hands so I drop things all the time
17571,"That is true! But it's part of life, stuff happens. Not the worst!"
17572,Feeling a bit scared about the weekend.
17573,"I have a hard time with my anxiety sometimes and I will be alone a lot this weekend. I don't like free time, I like to stay busy so I don't think much."
17574,I don't trust a lot of people. I do like being alone sometimes but if not then I just want to be with someone I trust- They are not always available.
17575,"That's annoying. So, does it still work and it's just hard to use, or does it just do nothing in general? Deals are always tricky like that, as sometimes they're too good to be true."
17576,"Yeah, especially since customer service is usually where companies skimp and don't try to hire or train employees very well. Well, I hope it has a good resolution in the end and something works out in your favor. I'm a clean freak, so I'd hate to not be able to clean properly when I wanted or needed to."
17577,That is just sad of a Dad to be that way. Kids need a lot of unconditional love..but parents aren't always perfect and sometimes don't know how to love their kids like they should !
17578,Still doesn't make it okay. I hope he gets some therapy and learns to be a better dad
17579,Oh gross!  They should have street cleaners taking care of that.  Poor animal.  
17580,"I bet.  I have never seen one up close so that turns my stomach too.  I can't stand seeing injured, hurt, or dead animals. Hope you're feeling better now."
17581,I bet you are proud!
17582,Good I wish him all the best!
17583,I agree. I used to be a deadbeat but now my life is dope.  Are you talking about a friend or family member
17584,Yes you can lead a horse to water...but you know the rest
17585,"Definitely not a sucker! If she helped you a lot and you wouldn't be here without her, then YES! Why did she block you? Were you bad to her? Sounds familiar to what has happened between me and a few...I was there for them but had enough and I have had to cuit them out too-"
17586,That is hard..I have been abused and burned...and sometimes you just can't go back..It's like the story of a the girl with the feather pillow..once you say something..you can't ever get it back and it's so hard to repair. Its hard to ever trust someone once they have broken it..I am there myself and don't know if I could ever trust or live with that person again. Life is hard but I am VERY glad you have learned and will treat others better
17587,"That's always a weird situation. You're excited about the offer, and you're worried that if you turn it down that you might not be able to find anything else, or as good. But you also don't want to be tied down to a bad place. What were some of the red flags, if you don't mind me asking?"
17588,"That's a really tough position to put yourself in. You would know better than most. I'm a cautious person.. if I felt like there was even a 50% chance of being able to find something close to decent, I'd turn them down. But if you think it's a desert out there and you can't find something to come close, it may be worth gritting your teeth and being there for a few years before you try to move on. I hope it works out!"
17589,That is tough. I would just make sure everything is nice and clean around the house so she can just unwind. Maybe make a nice dinner and do the dishes after.
17590,I see. I would maybe only bring it up if she wants to discuss. It a hard position to be in.
17591,Anywhere else? lol- You do not have a lot of thai places in town?
17592,Everything to me lol!  Sweet and sour chicken is the BEST
17593,That sounds like a fine day to me. Do you have many birds?
17594,Hah I know how you feel I love to feed birds and watch them outside my house as well.
17595,Oh no! I am so sorry- Turtles need a lot of care to thrive
17596,"Actually they are, that is why so many die in captivity..They need proper lights and diet etc..I guess if you know how to take care of animals then no- but so many just don't care when they have a pet who relies on them"
17597,What happened to the first one?
17598,I'm sure it will be fine.  Did you buy a good brand?
17599,Yeah occasionally stuff breaks during shipping.
17600,"So sorry, you never really can tell with these things can you?"
17601,I wish you good luck.
17602,Me too. I cant take this heat anymore. It is so muggy outside. Its so annoying.
17603,Same here. The humidity is just the absolute worse. 
17604,is there anything like free cash?
17605,i had that nothing good come easily
17606,Oh nice.  What type of presentation
17607,You think it will be a big success?
17608,That's awesome!  Any new changes lately?
17609,That sounds fun! I'm glad youre more comfortable now.
17610,Can you have it repaired?
17611,"Yes, I'm sure you'll be very nice to her."
17612,I am so sorry. I know that must be a difficult time.
17613,I hope you can find the positive in the situation and move forward. Focus on yourself.
17614,That should be fun. Where does the cruise go to?
17615,The Bahamas is beautiful. I am sure you will love it.
17616,They really do make you stronger dont they. It may not seem like it right away though.
17617,That is a great way to make the best out of the worst. Good for you.
17618,Good luck! Hope you do well
17619,I'm sure you'll get a good grade if you prepared well
17620,"wow, that's grate. Are you also a musician?"
17621,complete family with so much talent
17622,That makes you a queen.
17623,What's that ?
17624,Wow! That would be an awesome surprise to come home to!
17625,I would love to have that happen for me! You are lucky!
17626,Oh you did? What kind of job?
17627,Are you a stylist? 
17628,That's great! How can you tell you are on the right path?
17629,Congrats! That's awesome
17630,"that is good, i hope nothing went wrong"
17631,you should be proud of them. Nothing like family
17632,I hope it works out for you then.
17633,Well stick in there and you'll go far.
17634,"Wow, that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it!"
17635,"Excellent, hopefully you will share some of your wealth with me."
17636,That's great.  She sounds like a passionate and independent woman.
17637,I wish her and you the most abundant blessings and wealth and success.
17638,That was nice of him. What was it?
17639,That is great! Were you able to help pick it out?
17640,what kind of weather is that?
17641,"yah, safety first. "
17642,what kind of fun did you remember having there
17643,wow quite a long time
17644,He should be fine if he has prepared. I hope he does well.
17645,That great. Im sure you are real proud of him.
17646,Oh well maybe you'll get your blessings in a different way you didn't expect
17647,"It's cool, I got fired from my old job 5 months ago...only to upgrade to a self-employed lifestyle, making 2000 a week and hot chicks coming in and out of my apartment every night lol"
17648,"its sad but true, people dont want to see others doing well! got to be ready to protect what is yours! "
17649,"just keep working, learning and trying new things, cant go wrong like that i think!"
17650,Sounds exciting!
17651,Well I hope you have fun and I hope she does well.
17652,I bet that was frightening and nerve racking.
17653,At least you made it through allright.
17654,Did you play there a lot as a child?
17655,"Well, I hope you can recover from that as time passes."
17656,Im sorry to hear that. How long has she been sick?
17657,Absolutely! I would do anything for my kids too.
17658,because she wanted to give you a surprise present
17659,"hahahahah, i like the suspense, she is good at giving surprises "
17660,Horror movies give me so much anxiety. I cant watch them late at night.
17661,Maybe watch a comedy tonight. That might help out a little.
17662,That is amazing.  Those moments are wonderful and priceless!  How old is she now?
17663,"I love when they are young and it so fun to see what they learn and discover each day.  When they say enjoy every moment, they are so right!"
17664,"It is the start of their learning journey, be excited!"
17665,"Definitely, I wish them the best"
17666,"Oh no, have you made adjustments to ensure that wont happen again?"
17667,"I bet, kids need a lot of eyes on them, but its a catch-22 because you do not want to be too over protective"
17668,"Oh no, is she ok?"
17669,I'm so sorry. Do you have a good support system?
17670,How much is that?
17671,"Oh wow, that will help you out immensely."
17672,The quality of driving is going down and down.
17673,"Yeah, I agree. we've have to drive carefully."
17674,Did you want to go to New York?
17675,Maybe you will win something else!
17676,Oh no!  Was it a big one or not that big of a deal?
17677,"Oh good.  Well, at least its a big deal to you because that means you're taking things seriously and concerned about your work.  "
17678,"Oh no, did people make you feel bad for the accident?"
17679,"That sucks, if everyone pitched in to help it probably would've been cleaned up in record time."
17680,Yes all it takes is cutting back on some things you maybe dont need. I know it can be  hard to do though!
17681,Yes! Even $5 a week helps!
17682,Oh that's terrible!  What did you do with it?
17683,Good choice.  Can't mess with a brown recluse.
17684,Do you think it will be good news or bad news? 
17685,Very exciting. I hope you get it.
17686,"Awesome, do you plan to go early to try and get autographs?"
17687,"Enjoy yourself, if I may, refrain from recording it on your phone, just be in the moment!"
17688,"I personally have not, You must have though?"
17689,That's amazing. You sound extremely confident!
17690,"Oh no, did you get angry with him?"
17691,"Thats a fair punishment, they have to learn somehow"
17692,"Oh how exciting, to the big island or somewhere else?"
17693,Take advantage and make a lot of memories with your family!
17694,Oh no.  I am so sorry.  I have been there and its devastating.  How is everyone doing?
17695,It will take time.  Allow yourself to grieve and also doing something to remember your pet can help give closure.  Take care and take a day at a time.
17696,That's cool. What does she want to do there?
17697,That's cool. I have worked in a hospital as a nurse before.
17698,What role did your child use.
17699,"Awesome, I am sure you are proud of his individual effort."
17700,Do you have something exciting happening?
17701,That's great!  I would be pumped!
17702,Is there another class you can apply for?
17703,"That is a shame, keep your head up and hopefully you can get into it next year."
17704,"Oh that's really lucky!  What happened, did someone run a light or something?"
17705,"That stinks, but I'm glad he's ok!  That must be the scariest thing!"
17706,Do you know what kind of spider it was?
17707,Did it get you?
17708,Oh yeah? What kind of activities?
17709,Oh neat. I love those kinds of games.
17710,Could you call the police?
17711,uhmnnn! so what then happened after that?
17712,So how did you respond to that?
17713,"I haven't, though I've stepped in other poo.  Is it similar to others?"
17714,"Dog mostly, cat once or twice.  Possibly human, but I'd rather not think too hard on that."
17715,Oh good.  I'm glad you were prepared.  How did it go?
17716,Perfect!  Nothing better than being prepared and accomplishing something well!  Great job!
17717,That's exciting! How do you feel about it?
17718,That sounds great. I hope it goes well!
17719,"Oh I have always wanted to live at the beach, I bet you will have a blast"
17720,Best part about it is you will never have to leave!
17721,I hate parking tickets!  What a rip off.  How did it go?
17722,Sounds like you were prepared.  Did you get it dismissed? 
17723,The company must be doing well then?
17724,Ahh I see what you are saying. Maybe yall will get bonuses.
17725,Just show them what you have accomplished this past year
17726,Just be confident in your ability!
17727,Congratulations!  What degree did you get?
17728,"Awesome!  I bet that's a really versatile degree, you should be really successful!"
17729,Oh man! That was so nice of him! You're lucky to have him
17730,Hopefully you can pay him back in some way! 
17731,Are you fully prepared for it?
17732,"Great, good luck to you!"
17733,"Yes, do you ever remember playing in the ocean?"
17734,"Oh man, kids can be terrible about things like that.  They just have no filter.  What did you do?"
17735,"Well, that's the best you can do, is teach them what's appropriate and what isn't.  I think you handled it well."
17736,So did she accept your proposal?
17737,"thats nice to know,hope you find happiness together?"
17738,How proud of him were you?
17739,Just keep admiring your child.
17740,"That's pretty good.  you know what they say, ""C's get degrees""!"
17741,I know I sure didn't in college.  Did you get a job in your desired field?  That's what really matters.
17742,Have you thought about telling the store?
17743,To clear your conscious 
17744,That's great! what will you do with all the extra time together?
17745,sounds like fun to me! enjoy the time.
17746,Those two years must have been tough.  But this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you!
17747,Good luck in the final stage.  I hope you get the job.
17748,They're super creepy. Did something happen?
17749,I understand that. They just give off such bad vibes.
17750,Can you go to a shelter?
17751,Stay away from the windows just in case.
17752,That is so wonderful that you have something of hers.  I'm so sorry you lost her.  That is so difficult.  Did she love cooking?
17753,You still have her right there with you!  Its wonderful to know that you're keeping her food and memories so alive!
17754,Yea that is kind of a weird situation. I am sure she would want you to have a good time though.
17755,I wouldnt let it ruin a good time. Just dont mention it anymore maybe. Im sure you feel a little guilty.
17756,What was the opportunity?
17757,Did you put money on the reno?
17758,"Haha, that wasn't very wise."
17759,That's great! Are you excited about school too?
17760,Ohh wow! Well good luck and I hope you have a great time with your friends and school
17761,"Wow, that is horrible, what did you guys come down with?"
17762,"Wow, I hope you guys get better if you already haven't.  That's really a bummer to miss out on a family vacation!"
17763,That's wonderful!  I know how important that can be!  Our family of 4 only has one car so you need it to work!  What happened to yours?
17764,"Awesome!  I know, isn't that crazy how much repairs can cost?  Its ridiculous.  Well, happy travels!"
17765,Oh yeah? What's happening on Saturday?
17766,Congratulations! I hope you have something fun planned to celebrate.
17767,"The sounds very interesting, I am sure you could find others like it as well"
17768,Did you do it on pourpuse? and if so did you feel bad after?
17769,but it was an accident on your part so dont feel so bad about it
17770,Was it yours?
17771,Eww. Im sorry about that. That would have ruined my lunch quickly
17772,They must be a very good insurance company to be able to keep your business for that lnog!
17773,Well that's always a plus. Having a good relationship with the company or someone at the company can go a long way.
17774,That is amazing.  Most of those guys have been training for years for that level of eating.  What kind of pies were they?
17775,He really should.  Some of those folks make really good money just to eat a lot.  Pretty sweet gig! hahaha.
17776,Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Can you get it fixed?
17777,Wow that's expensive! I hope you can find a reasonable used car.
17778,"That's cool, I'm not too familiar with it myself.  Is it pretty interesting so far?"
17779,It's always nice to get lost in a good book.  One of my favorite hobbies.
17780,Oh no!  That is always terrible when technology stops working well.  What did you do to fix it?
17781,That's awesome!  You are talented! Maybe it'll go for another year so you can save.
17782,"Congratulations! If it helps at all, my wife and I have two young boys and both of her deliveries with very smooth! She said it wasn't as bad as she expected."
17783,I think those types of situations are rather rare! The medical field has come a very long way. I'm sure you'll be fine and it'll all be worth it in the end.
17784,im glad you were not harmed
17785,"im sorry, im sure it wasnt your fault"
17786,That's great! I love to design websites
17787,That's neat! I learned in college so I've had time to delve into it quite a bit and it is very fun. You choose great!
17788,That's no good!  Sorry about the rug. is she still a puppy?
17789,"I'm sure she'll learn quickly, and she'll be a good dog then!"
17790,"Disneyland is awesome, I went there twice as a kid!  What did you have to eat?"
17791,"That's true, it's like a whole different world when you are inside the park! Very magical."
17792,so do you hope to do there?
17793,can i join you?
17794,Wow! Well I hope you enjoy yourself and pray before you go on the plane
17795,Im sorry to hear that. How did she die?
17796,Oh wow! That stinks. How are you holding up?
17797,I'm so sorry to hear that! My sister went through something similar last year and I can tell you that it will help a lot to spend time with her as often as you can.
17798,Stay strong! Hopefully in the future she can have a healthy baby and be able to move on from this tragedy.
17799,"Aw, that's never fun.  My husband used to travel all the time for work and it was so lonely.  I'm glad she won't be gone too long.  I took advantage of the times he was gone to clean and organize and fix things to surprise him when he returned."
17800,"Wow, you're on top of things! Being apart does make the heart grow fonder. :) Make (or carry out) her a romantic dinner when she gets back. Go out with a friend while she's gone!"
17801,Did you do everything right?
17802,Well that stinks. That happens though. Sometimes you do something right and it doesn't show the same result as its supposed to 
17803,Why didn't you sleep well?
17804,I am sorry. You should get some sleep now then
17805,"Oh no, why'd you have to cancel?"
17806,Maybe you can plan for another time?
17807,Holy cow! That's amazing! Congrats!
17808,That's really amazing. How generous.
17809,"I HATE when that happens. In my case it was a dog, I caught him on camera! Maybe you should invest in a security cam?"
17810,I hear if you sprinkle red pepper all over your trash area it can help ward off some animals.
17811,"Oh no!  That would've made me so mad.  I let my kids use my computer too but always say, no drinks by it and wash your hands.  Kids always seem to forget that. "
17812,"It is a hard balance because they need to learn and it should make you mad, but people do make mistakes.  So hard to know how to act really but things are too expensive to not treat them well.  I hope you're able to find an easier way to fix it."
17813,Did you not go?
17814,That stinks. You should go this weekend?
17815,"Oh no! I'm really bad about that, too. Did you ask someone or try to play it off?"
17816,Nice. That's a good way to do it.
17817,"Mom of the year award! That's awesome, where are you going?"
17818,"That sounds fun, hope you guys drive safe and have fun!"
17819,I haven't seen it yet! How good was it?
17820,I dont blame you. I am looking forward to seeing it now
17821,Great job! I bet the boss was really proud of you
17822,Yay!  I love the end of the work day!  What are you going to do when you get home?
17823,What a perfect way to end the day!  I'm going to make a big chinese stir fry and watch tv.  Have a great night!
17824,"That sucks but, i'm glad you're enjoying your self still."
17825,I think thats a good idea. Look at it as an opportunity to make new friends.
17826,"That's good, are you going out later?"
17827,"That's awesome, hope you both have fun."
17828,"That is good, did they cheat  on you?"
17829,"Ouch, that always hurts.  I've been through that, and know that sting.  Hope you find a better partner who cares for you!"
17830,I look forward to the day where I can say the same! That must feel liberating!
17831,"Wow, you must be very financially responsible! I'm sure that'll help you do well in life. I'm practicing myself."
17832,I wouldn't want another car payment
17833,That's all you need.
17834,what if he doesn't pay?
17835,"well ,you need to consider the option of him not repaying too"
17836,That awesome! Did you guys have a good time and catch up?
17837,"Thats good to hear, always nice to see friends from your past!"
17838,how old is he or she?
17839,he must be a great achiever
17840,"Good job, you should do well on them if you're prepared!"
17841,"That's the mindset you need, good luck, I'm sure you will get A's!"
17842,"Good luck, are you pretty confident you're going to do well?"
17843,Yay! That's what makes all the hard work worth it. Congratulations! 
17844,Treadmills are great! I find that they're better your knees than running outside.
17845,"That's awesome to hear! We only get one body, we need to take care of it. Good luck!"
17846,That's so amazing. It's an incredible thing to be a parent!
17847,I wouldn't change it for the world
17848,Do you have a lot of debt?  I'm sure you will figure it out and get back on your feet.
17849,"I have a lot of student loan debt as well, I just focus on making sure I pay monthly.  I try not to think of how much I owe"
17850,"well,i wish you sucess"
17851,"you need my friend,its just like a success spell"
17852,Who did?  What happened? Are you OK?
17853,Wow!  That's horrible!  Don't feel bad though.  She is obviously just a gold digger.  You most likely just dodged a bullet!
17854,Did something specific happen?
17855,"I think that can affect even the best of us, I wouldn't let it get you down."
17856,Thats really sweet of you to help her out.
17857,"haha, yea thats a good way to look at it.  I never thought of it like that"
17858,Are you scared you may want to in the future and it would be too late?
17859,It is never too late!  You can always adopt!
17860,my cousin and my aunt are both teachers and they love it
17861,haha. it's alot of work but it's rewarding
17862,oh no. what was it?
17863,that can be so traumatizing. i'm so sorry.
17864,Its always so exciting to take a trip or vacation.  but its even more exciting to see family
17865,"Haha, yea thats how I feel about my In laws.  Im glad they are a 4 hour plane ride away"
17866,what sounds like a wonderful time?
17867,That does sound like a lot of fun.  I miss hanging out with all of my firends
17868,why are you so mad?
17869,Yes my friend experienced the same thing recently. It is a terrible thing especially when they make you pay to repair it.
17870,Oh wow yeah that is quite impressive! He should become a lawyer if he isn't one already!
17871,"Yeah, I have heard some people have that! Sometimes after just reading a bunch of information just once can remember every single word!"
17872,"Haha!  I know exactly what you are talking about!  I love that show and yes, it is quite gross!  You must have felt quite disgusted!"
17873,Ooo!  Yuck!  I hope you don't get nightmares from it!
17874,oh no. what happened?
17875,oh goodness. where you able to make it out of there without getting sick or dirty?
17876,"That can be a lot of work.  We are trying to go through that now too, so i know how you are feeling"
17877,My thoughts and prayers are with you guys.  I hope you succeed.  Make sure you keep practicing
17878,"that is awful, why did he do that"
17879,did you tell him the truth?
17880,I can imagine that was very scary! I don't know if I would be that brave!
17881,I guess it was a lifetime opportunity too. I'm sure it was an amazing experience!
17882,Why do you feel that way
17883,That does sound hard
17884,"Uhoh. be careful, there are some bad drivers out there.  Especially with people playing on their phones while driving"
17885,Ive actually called the police during a situation like that.  I was worried someone was going to get killed
17886,Do you guys not get together as much? 
17887,"I know that feeling, I have a brother I don't see as much as I used to."
17888,Dogs are the best
17889,That was very nice of you
17890,i love driving past old places from my childhood too! they always seem much smaller than i remember
17891,its great that you were able to go visit
17892,That doesnt sound very safe.  I hope you dont lose power
17893,well stay inside and stay dry
17894,That sucks. I know how you feel.  Do you have a day job?
17895,That sucks. I've also been through that. Among other benefit cuts.
17896,thats pretty neat.  I think that might be worth a lot of money
17897,well that might make it more valuable to you then.  Does it still work?
17898,Well... did you?
17899,Ah too bad you're married.    Pro's and con's
17900,Ugh. Those are the worst.
17901,I wish people could be more considerate on the road. Its so annoying.
17902,Do you like your new city?
17903,How do your friends feel about the situation?
17904,What is the CPA exam?
17905,I bet he must be extremely relieved and happy to have that exam behind him. Those exams can be extremely nerve wracking. Did he have longs periods of study time?
17906,"Oh no, that is scary!  Did his owner get control of him quickly?"
17907,"Goodness, it was a good thing you were right there and able to usher them inside so quickly.  I can't imagine the results had you not been able to get to them quick enough!"
17908,the unknown gives me so much stress
17909,it get so bad i get severe anxiety
17910,"Im sorry to hear that, Is he going to the doctor for help?"
17911,"Oh wow it sounds like he is doing great, I hope he feels better soon!"
17912,I completely understand 
17913,I feel for you and hope you have a way to manage it 
17914,"I bet! I would be so jealous, too! Maybe your neighbor will let you come over and swim?"
17915,That's a great way to look at it- take advantage of their investment for now- and then later you can have your own pool!
17916,"Wow! That is cool, do you spend a lot of time with him?"
17917,I hope you many more years of happy marriage!
17918,Did everything turn out alright?
17919,Hopefully they can work it out
17920,Its nice to get a good sweat
17921,That's no fun!  How long did they have you waiting?
17922,Don't be too angry.  They might just have been swamped with prescriptions to fill.
17923,It will be worth it though
17924,I am sure you will be safe
17925,"Yeah, I don't think anyone likes going. How did it go?"
17926,"I am glad you got the help you needed, and I hope you get better soon."
17927,"Ouch, are you alright?"
17928,I bet.  Did your work cover your medical bills?
17929,oh yippeee! what kind of puppy?
17930,i bet. dogs are amazing. we have a big ole mutt who is 75 lbs of lap dog love
17931,"Oh wow, that would be nice"
17932,It gives you something to work for
17933,"Yeah that's sad, I hope it found it's owner somehow."
17934,"Yeah, you can't always help everybody and everything though."
17935,Try not to be.  Focus on yourself and your goals.  Use their judgmental looks to push you workout to the max!
17936,I hope it helps!
17937,Bosses are sometimes unaware it seems
17938,I would hate working there
17939,i have a pet rabbit. that makes me sad
17940,"sometimes on my way to work i find deer, skunk, cats, misc other dead animals and it makes me so sad"
17941,Well that is what makes life fun
17942,Wow that's super lucky! So you have no idea where it came from?
17943,That's a true blessing. I am very happy for you!
17944,"That is so funny, but I know exactly how you feel.  Sometimes vacations can get too long.  Did you leave town?"
17945,That sounds like a heck of a trip!
17946,That is good to hear.  Have you been ill for a while.  I hope not.
17947,That's really to bad.  I hope the medicine works well and you are back to normal very soon!
17948,i used to sit in 2 hours of traffic daily. no longer is that my problem
17949,i love my slow country life
17950,I believe that was me
17951,"Ha, well I still feel bad about it, I promise"
17952,nice talking to you for sure
17953,You sound like you are going to do well then
17954,I am glad it was easy for you
17955,"Aw, yeah I've been missing my Mom lately as well."
17956,"Hopefully your mom hasn't passed away, and you just haven't visited her in a while."
17957,That is so crazy.  I love how Facebook reconnects people from so long ago.  Do you have any plans to meet up some time?
17958,What has he been up to in the mean time?
17959,"That must be frustrating, but it really sounds like your trying to look at it in a positive light and that always makes things a little easier!"
17960,Uh oh. Was it bad?
17961,Well at least it wasn't too bad...even if it was a little embarrassing.
17962,Its nice to find good deals
17963,That sounds so nice I'm jealous.
17964,I definitely need to. Hope you can also continue to enjoy relaxing time.
17965,How did you do
17966,"Aww, it's nice to relive those old memories sometimes."
17967,Pictures are nice to have to be able to look back on life.
17968,Kids can be annoying
17969,Screaming is never good
17970,Why did you lie about it?
17971,"I am a saints fan, so I am excited too ha"
17972,"I read it today, he is a different kind of guy for sure"
17973,That is a great attitude to have.  I know it is hard to go through periods of struggle.  Do you have hope that things will get better soon?
17974,"That is phenomenal!  In hard times it is easy to distace ourselves from God, but I believe it is important to press in and cast our cares on Him."
17975,Oh really? Actually I think that is a good thing. How's is going?
17976,I think that's a good decision by your and your wife. And I think your wife's grandmother is going to recover well.
17977,They will be good again
17978,I am a saints fan though ha
17979,What game was that?
17980,Which teams played?
17981,Well I hope they play well for you :)
17982,It happens sometimes...I get fired up watching the Lakers play lol.
17983,Is it all expenses paid?
17984,"Well, congrats on winning that?"
17985,My son really liked Pokemon too! He liked playing the card game and watching the show.
17986,"Yes, and I know there are still some fans around now too. Of course, they are more popular ones."
17987,What kind of work is it
17988,That does not sound fun at all
17989,"I know what you mean, hope it gets better!"
17990,"I get that, here is to hoping it shows up soon!"
17991,That's unfortunate. I have missed them before too and I hate when that happens.
17992,Oh wow! How lucky! Perfect timing.
17993,I bet that was a huge relief.
17994,"Don't be jealous, instead, brush on your studying and start going to the gym."
17995,"Yeah, I do agree. Sometimes it seems like people are just plain blessed."
17996,"I get that, but things are still better for those around you, so it feels bad still"
17997,I don't follow football much.  Were they not the favored to win?
17998,Oh wow.  Were you hoping the other team would win?
17999,"Oh, really? Kayaking is awesome! What a fun and adventurous person you must be. "
18000,Hiking and kayaking? Wow! Better pack some trail mix.
18001,I am sure it will get better
18002,You just need to make a plan for yourself
18003,"oh, well that sucks! It can be very aggravating to spend time working on something, and then have it destroyed!"
18004,"Yes, not only a waste of your time, but the money. No doubt, very frustrating, and I'm sure you wanted to teach the dog a lesson "
18005,That's great that you have such trust in him. 
18006,That is a true friend that's worth having for a lifetime if possible. I am happy for you.
18007,I bet they will miss you not being there
18008,You will have time again
18009,I bet that is nerve-wracking! I hope you get it.
18010,ah it happens lol
18011,Feeling nostalgic can be great. Where are you from?
18012,"I can see why you miss it, as I actually live in New Orleans currently."
18013,Being positive is all you can do
18014,Being busy always helps things
18015,Oh nice. I'm happy that you got some rest. What do you do for work?
18016,Sounds pretty interesting. I hope everything goes well for you.
18017,Oh yeah? Did you get any good tips from him?
18018,That's inspirational at least. I'm sure we can all do better at saving.
18019,Oh that sounds pretty nice
18020,"Well, I guess if you're a pretty regular gym-goer, you shouldn't feel bad about missing a day every once in a while."
18021,"Hey, no problem. Just gotta lift heavier next time haha"
18022,"I think that is normal, are you still friends"
18023,"Oh well, you will find someone else"
18024,That is a nice way to wake up. Was it a good day?
18025,That is really good. I am happy to hear that.
18026,Are you excited to go back
18027,Its nice to have help
18028,Was traffic particulary bad this morning?
18029,"Ugh, I hate when traffic is like that!  We live near Atlanta and it's always so bad."
18030,Are they doing well in school?
18031,"They do, just make sure to cherish it"
18032,Did you try hard?
18033,Well you can with the next job
18034,Why didn't you make any plans before the weekend started?
18035,"Well, I hope you feel better and get some rest. Maybe next weekend will be better for you."
18036,"Oh wow, that is impressive indeed"
18037,I assume he got you there ok?
18038,Sounds like you've got a good brother.
18039,Income is very important always
18040,Luck has nothing to do with usually
18041,"Sometimes if the storm is severe enough, it's best to just pull over."
18042,"I guess nowadays with how everything is going, it just feels like rush, rush, rush. Gotta sink or swim"
18043,That's always fun to look at pictures.
18044,That's good to have.
18045,"I am sorry, that is always sad"
18046,"Oh wow, it had a good life I am sure"
18047,"Oh my lord, I am glad you are okay"
18048,That is understandable.  Did you end up going?
18049,Are you going out again?
18050,I have felt that for sure in the past
18051,It just gave me a positive feeling really
18052,What made you feel that way?
18053,"I guess just make sure not to push it, there is a fine line between confidence and pride."
18054,That is really nice.  What did you all do?
18055,I love craft beer.  How many of you were ther?
18056,That is so gross and rude
18057,I guess that is a no
18058,That's nothing to be depressed about. 
18059,Start hanging out with friends and enjoy life.
18060,Did you check the last place you had it?
18061,"Oh, that's lame. He should have checked for you."
18062,I am sure you deserved some candy
18063,"You shouldnt, its nice to have some candy every once and awhile"
18064,"I know what you mean.  My dad carries a gun in his car, so I won't let him drive my kids anywhere.  What did you do?"
18065,Good choice.
18066,"That's great, good for him! It's always makes you feel good when your hard work is appreciated."
18067,"Well, it's nice that you are happy for him as well. I'm sure he can find many uses for the extra money."
18068,Are you going to see her again? 
18069,Oh that's terrible. Did you get it resolved?
18070,"Maybe the bank's fault? Oh well, at least it came in! Better late than never."
18071,Are you excited about it
18072,I hope it goes well
18073,That kind of stuff is always scary.  Do you have the results yet?
18074,"I am so glad to hear it!  Are you feeling better, though?"
18075,Do they have any idea what is going on?
18076,I do too.  My wife has been very sick for the last 13 years and she just switched to a diet called Nutritarian and after three months is almost back to her old self.
18077,Oh no! Is everything okay? What happened?
18078,"Wow, that first-time fire extinguisher purchase and replacement of the fire alarm batteries was definitely a blessing."
18079,Its always nice to have that perspective
18080,That is very true
18081,What was wrong?
18082,"Oh, did they find out why?"
18083,"Well, that's good. Sounds like you guys will be having some fun watching the game. Much better than TV!"
18084,"Well, I hope you guys have a good time"
18085,"Oh, how long were you dating?"
18086,Well they made up for it last year
18087,"Oh yeah, I forgot about that ha"
18088,Why were you so surprised?
18089,Do you have any other favorite teams?
18090,Oh that's terrible. It's been so hot lately. I bet you struggled.
18091,Well I hope you can get it fixed soon! Still more hot days to come yet.
18092,Any fun plans?
18093,How did they do that?
18094,"Oh, is that the newest? I haven't played on one since super nintendo!"
18095,"What is it like playing it, is it virtual reality/?"
18096,Thats never fun. Hope you can make time with them next week.
18097,"Good, friends are worth trying repeatedly for."
18098,"A prodigy, huh?  What instrument does he play?"
18099,That is awesome!  Does he have any recitals coming up?
18100,My brother just bought a new watch and I want it so bad.
18101,"I can't afford it, but maybe he'll give it to me for Christmas."
18102,I hope you get it! What type of job did you apply for
18103,What traits do you have that make you think you're qualified for the job
18104,Its nice to be prepared
18105,I will have to start doing that
18106,Its nice to have friends like that
18107,Its nice to have people there for you always
18108,I hate that. Especially at nighttime. It can be pretty scary.
18109,Might have to sleep with the lights on next time it happens. Haha
18110,"Never a good thing, did she have a good reason or ask to reschedule?"
18111,"That's not fun, but maybe it was for the best."
18112,That must have been nice.  What did they make you?
18113,Very nice.  Did you enjoy it?
18114,"Oh no, is it able to be saved"
18115,Oh lord! I am glad you have something that is a healthy hobby
18116,That's cool! It's always good to have a hobby
18117,Do you have an example?
18118,"That is never fun, I always return the favor"
18119,"I don't like gory movies but scary ones I do. I used to be the same way as you, though."
18120,I won't either haha just not my thing! 
18121,"Ah, maybe it will look up for you. She could still call?"
18122,"Well, even if she doesn't you could always be straight-forward with her and just ask her if she's not into you then let you know so you can move on."
18123,Just thinking positive thoughts
18124,Its good to have faith
18125,"Ok, if that's what you decide to do I believe you have had time to think it through "
18126,"Ok, the most important thing is that you have a source that pays for the bills"
18127,Connecting with the people that mattered the most makes me super excited
18128,"Oh, I bet that is going to be fun"
18129,I hope you have fun then
18130,Very nice. The weather should be perfect.
18131,Drink a few beers and have a hotdog for me. Should be fun.
18132,Hey well at least they didn't do too bad last year
18133,I'm a Patriots fan 
18134,Is this your girlfriend?
18135,"Oh, that might be the issue"
18136,"Oh no, what a jerk thing to do"
18137,"That doesnt make sense, oh well"
18138,Aww I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she went to a good home. 
18139,That's good to hear. I'm sure you miss her a lot.
18140,What band is it

18144,Nice! I hope they do well!
18145,It is really nice to have a great family.  Do they live close by?
18146,That is great.  Having a great family network makes life so much better.
18147,"Wow, holy cow, how old were you when you got married?"
18148,"Good, I am glad there is still true love out there!"
18149,"THat's terrible, did they not have enough open?"
18150,"Never good, makes them look bad to the customers"
18151,I hate government officials like that
18152,Too much as well
18153,That is nice. What was the gift?
18154,Cool. What were the teams playing?
18155,"That should be a fun time, hope you stay safe!"

18157,Do you think they win it all again this year
18158,Who is Carson Wentz? I believe he is a football player correct? What happened to him :O
18159,"Oh man thats crazy, ACL injuries are hard to recover from! Hope the Eagles win tonight!"
18160,"I saw that, I can't wait to play!"
18161,"Yes! I was astounded how good it looks, didn't expect it to be like that!"
18162,What kind of car did he get?
18163,I love BMW. What model car did he get?
18164,I am sorry you have a bad back
18165,"I have had one too, its not a good thing"
18166,I always hate seeing any kind of animal on the side of the road
18167,The worst is seeing something that looks like one of your pets too. Always fear for a break out at home 
18168,How dirty was it?
18169,"Oh, why did they clean it for you?"
18170,Those games do seem fun
18171,Are you gonna get a bonus for it?
18172,"Good, best of luck with that, you deserve it!"
18173,I am glad you got out of it
18174,I understand. Some people doesn't like those kind of movies. I am not a fan also.
18175,What car do you want? I am in the same boat!
18176,"I am looking at Ford Fiesta, it is a bit cheaper and runs smoothly"
18177,Nice! i just picked up the new madden so i will be gaming all weekend as well

18181,"Oh wow, you must be proud! I hope he praised you for your work and gave you a reward?"
18182,"Yes, Sounds like you deserve one! Keep working hard and show them you earned it."
18183,What have you been worried about? 
18184,"Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! I hope things start looking better for you. Can you file for disability or social security? "
18185,I completely understand.  I get pretty aggravated myself driving home from work everynight.
18186,It takes me almost an hour to get home through traffic.
18187,"Oh no, was the cop understanding"
18188,"Oh no, that is a mean thing to do"
18189,Its nice to have that feeling
18190,I do hope it stays that way for you
18191,Why did you skip it?
18192,"Oh, well your body comes first, health over improvement"
18193,"thats very nice to hear, how long have yall be together?"
18194,nice! my wife and i have have been together 9!
18195,Why did you need to wait?
18196,"Oh, you couldn't download it anyways?"
18197,I feel like you should to if you know you work hard go for it.
18198,Maybe go to HR I had to do that for my raise and they spoke to my supervisor and he agreed.
18199,Sounds like you deserve it then
18200,"I understand, I feel the same way sometimes. It's hard because sometimes you can't help or know they have problems that made them homeless like drinking."
18201,"Yes, sometimes they won't accept when I offer them food. They just want money to buy beer. It is very sad!"
18202,Why were you feeling that way
18203,That is very scary
18204,"Ohh, what's that for? a party?"
18205,"oh cool. It always feels nice and relaxing, being with your friends."
18206,I hate when they do that
18207,That is probably best
18208,"Me too, I hate driving in it. It is sometime to difficult to see the road."
18209,"Anyway, now, it is summer. There is less rainy days."
18210,What truck is it?
18211,"Oh wow that is old, glad it still runs!"
18212,Did you have any money bet on the game ?
18213,"Well, I meant privately."
18214,Wow! Did you do anything special while she was there?
18215,Nice! I hope you feel better!
18216,"Yes, I understand! Life is easier as a kid."
18217,"Same sometimes, But I enjoy the freedom and indepence of being an adult."
18218,I use to love those I didn't know they stop selling can you buy something else like different game system?
18219,You said they didn't have a direct in a while do you mean like a direct game come out im no game wiz for the new age lol.
18220,Like actually assaulted or robbed?
18221,"Oh, I am very sorry to hear that, I hope you feel okay now"
18222,It is amazing. For how long have you been playing this game?
18223,I played a lot of video games when I was kid. I liked that so much.
18224,Being humble is the way to be
18225,That is very wise thinking
18226,"Oh, that does sound nice. What comics were you reading?"
18227,"Oh cool. I like comics, but I'm not really a fan of Batman or Justice League."
18228,Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Have you even been interested in athletics?
18229,I am sure there are some things you are more gifted at as well.
18230,"Yeah I know what you mean, those days were the best"
18231,"Yeah exactly, I think back on those days very fondly"
18232,"Nice, when does the new game come out? Or is it already out haha"
18233,I don't know much about video games but remember playing Mario and games on a Nintendo 64.
18234,I'm sorry to hear that. What were you worried about?
18235,Was she ok?
18236,"Ohh, I feel sorry for you. It happens."

18429,"That's hard, but at least you know now and can perhaps move on."
18430,You got a good sister!

18646,Perhaps she had an upset tummy or something.  Sometimes with dogs it's hard to tell.
18647,That sounds like fun! Where are you taking them? The junkyard?
18648,"Aw, that's sounds like so much fun! You sound like awesome parents :)"
18649,"I love Madden, I can't wait to play it!"
18650,I am so jealous!
18651,"whoa, is the other woman more attractive?"
18652,how long have you been married?
18653,MY crocodile always does that 
18654,Get a prosthetic. I cant spell
18655,What a tragedy! Did anyone say anything about it?
18656,"I am sure you did, but at least you don't look crazy every day like I do."
18657,HAHA that sounds just like my husband!
18658,Well sometimes men tend to get lost in their video game world
18659,That's awesome! You must be a hard worker to be so confident!
18660,"Oh well in that case, I'm sure you'll get it! He must have confidence in you too."
18661,I am sure you will do well!
18662,Just stay positive and everything will work out.
18663,How do you think you did on it?
18664,"I am sure you did fine on it. And besides, if you did poorly, there is always the good ole local McDonalds."
18665,"I can understand that - I think all of us, at one point or another, did something we were ashamed of.  "
18666,"I know that feeling, kinda sick to your stomach can't get it out of your head kinda thing.  We all have to have a method to overcome it and move on."
18667,"Aw, that's nice. Did they get along?"
18668,"Oh god, that is horrifying! I would've wanted to hide under a rock too!"
18669,"I know what you mean, I long for the day when mine grow up and go away to college."
18670,"They can be rambunctious, mine drive me up the wall sometimes."
18671,i know that feeling
18672,Im sorry. It will happen til someone else soon enough
18673,Oh man! Which one was it?
18674,I saw that movie too! One of the scariest I have ever seen.
18675,Are you prepared for it?
18676,"Absolutely, that's the spirit!"
18677,"Aw, why is that? Is it acting up?"
18678,Why is that? The military isn't so bad. The pay is really nice if you stick around for a bit.
18679,How do you think you are going to do?
18680,I am confident you will do well!
18681,Well that's great! Has she practiced enough to get her actual license?
18682,"Oh yes, definitely. It's OTHER drivers you have to watch out for. People halfway pay attention to what they're doing on the road!"
18683,That was very nice of you!  I wish more people would react the way that you did.
18684,"And that's all we really can do honestly, if more people did that this world would be a better place all around."
18685,I love pecan pie. My grandma used to make it
18686,They can make their own pies
18687,Yeah I know how that is. My kids eat me out of house and home.
18688,Well kids do need to eat. They grow up so quickly.
18689,That sounds revolting! What did you do?
18690,Poor frog. May it rest in peace. I will pray for it tonight.
18691,Are you going to get a new one?
18692,Do you live near the Rockies?
18693,That is good of you to support her.
18694,You have a great family!
18695,"That is just gross!  Did you say anything to him, like ""Dude, what are you doing?"""
18696,"Well, if you've ever seen Friends, Rachel makes a trifle with whipped cream, bananas, jam, and ground beef and peas!!"
18697,Is there some good news?
18698,That is such a heartwarming story!
18699,Do you feel as prepared as you can be for it?
18700,"Well that is a great attitude, I bet you will do amazing!!"
18701,Oh no! That's terrible
18702,How did it even rollaway if its that huge?
18703,Oh yeah? That's pretty nice that you would help her out like that.
18704,"Wow, that would make me mad too. What a devious scamp!"
18705,That is really sad and devastating. 
18706,I am glad to hear he is doing better. 
18707,thats great i hope you get it !
18708,"Money is always good, and you will be near your son hopefully he does not find it embarrassing , u know how kids are    "
18709,Damn you are the MVP. I have only eaten two in a day. I am jealous.
18710,Well maybe they should think about emigrating south. I heard the charter schools there are subpar.
18711,"Well, kids eventually grow and become independent. Maybe you can try and go fishing with them or something? Or a family picnic?"
18712,That would work too! Or maybe a good meal?
18713,That's really not good. Did you feel bad about it?
18714,Maybe you should see a counselor. Or just get out of the relationship.
18715,So what did you do? Did you confront him?
18716,I can't find words to describe my laughter right now. You are the best
18717,What did you do for you?
18718,That is such a bold move to make.  Congratulations!
18719,Do you enjoy cooking for others or for the event you are taking it to?
18720,I bet it will be great - I've always loved a good tuna casserole!
18721,That's fantastic! Was anyone around to witness the glory?
18722,You deserve a purple heart for the bravery you showed today.
18723,"That's awesome, congratulations!"
18724,You must be so proud of her
18725,That would scare the heck out of me! How did you find out what it was?
18726,What a crazy night! I bet you didn't get much sleep.
18727,Is your dog still a puppy?
18728,I'm sure she will grow out of it.
18729,Oh wow. What for?
18730,I would hope so. That was a very generous gesture on your part.
18731,That's so nice! Did they have a good day?
18732,That's good. It's nice when everything turns out great in the end.
18733,wow. in the middle of the week. you mustve really been surprised
18734,Cool.
18735,Oh wow! Congratulations! How much did you pay for the ticket?
18736,Oh wow! I bet you'll have that $99 in no time so you can buy another! Good job!
18737,Friggin Becky! Why would she do such a thing!
18738,Yeah! Get even and slap that jerk in the face with the shoes she bought!
18739,Oh that's terrible. Is he okay?
18740,"That's bad, but really good that he is fine! I am very glad for both you and him."
18741,Eww!  I hope you were able to miss it and not drive over it
18742,"Yeah, I certainly do not envy the person that has to clean those things up!  "
18743,congratulations. what are you having?
18744,i have two girls and a boy
18745,Wow that is so nice!
18746,Why? What was the problem?
18747,I had the same problem.
18748,That's a responsible decision on your part. Are you nervous about it?
18749,That's good. I am sure he will turn out happy and healthy!
18750,That really sucks. Did you find it?
18751,That's really good! Was all your money in there?
18752,Okay. are you preparing now?
18753,Don't worry. You can do well. Hope you score well.
18754,Oh wow. Did everything turn out okay?
18755,Well I am so glad it turned out okay! Especially since your daughter is healthy and kicking. Congrats :)
18756,"Wow, how exciting!!  It's been a long time since I've had a birthday party - are you going anywhere special?"
18757,"OOOO I love gifts!!!  I know it's never ""about the gift"" but ok, it is SO nice to get presents!!"
18758,"While I understand the motives behind your deception, I must caution that it may catch up with you one day. How did you do it?"
18759,"That's OK. Everyone makes mistakes, just study hard and don't do it again in the future."
18760,was it on a scratch off?
18761,thats awesome! i need some of that luck
18762,"Oh cool, for what console?"
18763,"Yes, but for Xbox one."
18764,"Oh no, I hope she wasn't your ride homw"
18765,That's happened to me before... not fun
18766,Oh cool! Where are you guys going?
18767,That sounds like fun! Beach days are the best days!
18768,Do you think you will tell the professor/teacher about it?
18769,Oh geez. Did you get any tears in your eye?
18770,"Awww, that's so sweet. I remember when my little girl was taking tap dance classes. So precious!"
18771,You have a pet armadillo?
18772,I hope it gets potty trained.
18773,Nice! Have you gone cruising in it yet?
18774,I would be too. That's a nice car!
18775,Congratulations! Have you decided on a name yet?
18776,That sounds wonderful. I'm happy for you and your new daughter!
18777,Aww I'm sorry for your loss. How is your family holding up?
18778,Yeah it sounds like she did take advantage. That's a cruel thing to do.
18779,I love pickles and I always order extra!  We must be twins!
18780,6?? How is that EXTRA?  12 - that would be extra - crazy!!!
18781,It seems like a nice way to relax
18782,I will try that when the weather is cooler
18783,That really sucks. Maybe you should force feed him some melatonin?
18784,"Oh, well hopefully that works. Wouldn't want you up all night!"
18785,"Nice, what was the occasion?"
18786,That is a great thing. I wish I had a girlfriend like that.
18787,That's really terrible. Are you going to get a new one?
18788,That's a good idea. Or I would adopt one. I adopted two from PetsMart and it only cost me 15 bucks!
18789,"I'm sorry, does that happen often?"
18790,I hope they treat you better in the future.
18791,Oh no! What did you do? Are you going to dispute it?
18792,Well that's a relief! Wouldn't want the IRS to seize your house!
18793,I've never used one.  How did it work out for you?
18794,I can understand that!  It's crazy how scary things can be out there now -and the news does not help at all!  But I'm glad you are safe!!
18795,I love horses! Has she been riding a long time?
18796,Oh no! I'm glad she was okay!
18797,did you get to try some good food?
18798,"Oh, which series is it?"
18799,Good. I hope you enjoy the game and play well.
18800,Oh no! I'm sure it didn't do it on purpose
18801,Poor parrot
18802,"Nice! If it pays more, then why wouldn't you take it?"
18803,Gotta put up with some discomfort to make dat bank.
18804,monsters under the bed?
18805,I used to believe they were in my closet too
18806,Oh yeah? When are you heading over?
18807,"Yeah, I guess it is kinda jerkish of them. I would give the ole copparoos a call so you can get some sleep."
18808,That is such a bizarre story.
18809,I hope it gets resolved.
18810,"wow, who sent it to you?"
18811,"wow, you"
18812,"thats really nice, are yall friends?"
18813,oh i know the feeling. its good they are down to earth though
18814,"That has always bothered me as well.  I mean, how much effort does it take to just wave as a thank you?"
18815,"People do not seem to have much of it these days unfortunately.  I promise if you ever let me out, I'll wave."
18816,That sounds so cool! Did you find any good ones?
18817,That's so nice. Any in particular that you liked?
18818,Woo good luck!
18819,It's good you studied!
18820,"I love fried twinkies, you will too!"
18821,I am so excited for you!
18822,did you do it bare foot ? that is nasty i dont own pets at all but i can imagine your situation 
18823,its really stinky i have smelled it before 
18824,Oh no! I bet it was a huge poop! What did you do with it?
18825,Well that's what he gets for pooping on the rug! He knew better!
18826,That sounds like a very fond memory that brings back a lot of nostalgia. Where would he take you?
18827,That sound so relaxing. I wish I had parents to do that with.
18828,lol how did the guests react?
18829,thats embarrassing! gotta love pets
18830,Madden is a fun game/ My husband plays it a lot instead of paying attention to me.
18831,"See, you know what's up! I need you to hang out with my husband so it'll rub off on him!"
18832,Dang! Did the guy get hurt?
18833,Almost makes me want to become the next Steve Irwin. I'd be better than him because there ain't no way that I would let a stupid stingray end my life!
18834,You have a lemur as a pet?
18835,I am sorry about your situation.
18836,What does she do that's so bad?
18837,"Yeah, she sounds terrible."
18838,I don't blame you.  I don't like giving out money like that - you just never know what they may do with it.
18839,"Well, like I said, you couldn't be sure that she would use it in a good way.  She could have bought alcohol, etc.. with it.  What I usually do is if they are asking for money for food, I will go and buy them a meal or go get them some groceries that aren't perishable."
18840,Did you have fun at least?
18841,Oh I'm sorry to hear that
18842,That's great! Is it a boy or a girl?
18843,That's so nice! What are you going to name her?
18844,Well I think you're gonna do a great job on it
18845,You got this homie! I bet you're gonna get an A!
18846,"Awww, poor dog! Did you give it a treat to make it up?"
18847,"Well, I am sure he can tell you're sorry by your actions. Doggies are smart like that!"
18848,"Oh cool, what's in it?"
18849,"Ah man, I built my own computer about a year ago...it had like 10 important, expensive parts, and I had to wait for them all!"
18850,That is an awesome phone!
18851,If you have a tracking number you should be okay.
18852,Well you're a good man. Not many of yall out there these days.
18853,Exactly. I still have hope for a new generation of nice guys to come along one day.
18854,lmao how the heck did that happen
18855,oh man i am sorry to hear that! hopefully you find him!
18856,Oh Im so sorry to hear that
18857,Were you close?
18858,thats awesome! what kind of contest?
18859,free money is always great!
18860,I hate when that happens! What did you do?
18861,"Well, I hope it doesn't happen again. And I hope you find out who did it and give them an earful!"
18862,Congratulations!  I am so happy for you!
18863,That will be quite an adventure!
18864,That's a dang shame. Have you said anything to him about it?
18865,That would boil my blood. You just gotta smack him upside the head!
18866,shame on him. How did you find out?
18867,Did he receive a failing grade?
18868,That's too bad. Why do you think she is doing that?
18869,Those dastardly kids! I hope she grows out of it eventually.
18870,I've been there before!  Do you ever remember the stuff that you do?
18871,Oh no!  I hope it wasn't too embarrasing!
18872,"i want kids too , and im getting pretty old , how old are you guys ???"
18873,dang im 31 i wish u the best 
18874,wow that is an awesome gift!!
18875,I bet you'll have a great time
18876,Do you think you will get it?
18877,That's wonderful! I'm sure you are an excellent candidate!
18878,That's great that you have so much confidence.  What classes do you have?
18879,Those easy semesters help when you know you've got some harder ones on the horizon.  Good Luck!
18880,thats terrible
18881,how did your daughter take it
18882,I bet they are! You're a lucky man!
18883,It is. Mine are all grown now and it's like they grow up right before your eyes in a blink.
18884,awesome! what kind?
18885,whoa that is an awesome ride! what color?
18886,Does she compensate you or anything like that?
18887,Will she not repay the favor at all?
18888,Did he get it?
18889,Well at least it wasnt all for nothing
18890,You should hire someone to do that.
18891,Do you think they will return it if they borrow it?
18892,I wouldn't let them borrow it. Who has time for all that?
18893,"Oh my heavens, how long ago was that?"
18894,It's cool that you experienced that. I love going to the movies!
18895,Oh no I'm so sorry. I love cats
18896,At least the cat lived a good life by your side
18897,work is such a drag. the time we lose from it we never get back
18898,people are just like that. our childhood is gone and we have to fend for ourselves now
18899,I hear thats an amazing show but I've never seen it before
18900,"They sound really scary, I hope I never see one!"
18901,it will. i hope i am long gone
18902,maybe i will be a zombie!
18903,awww. boy or girl
18904,Well a happy healthy baby is the best kind
18905,"I know what you mean, I love it so much. Who's your favorite character?"
18906,I'm #teamjonsnow til the bitter end!
18907,My parents had difficulties conceiving as well. What happened in the end?
18908,"That's so good to hear! I am actually adopted myself, and I love my family so much."
18909,Why ddi it need to rain today?
18910,Was the weather nice instead?
18911,What is your favorite show?
18912,Maybe you should watch some Netflix.
18913,Has he done something to make you want to break up with him?
18914,"Well, if you know he's not the one, it's better to do it now than years from now."
18915,what is that?
18916,sounds awful
18917,I have never seen that show but I have heard of it.
18918,I do not watch a lot of TV.
18919,i've been there lol
18920,thats too far away
18921,"Raising children is hard, to say the least. What did she lie about most recently?"
18922,Well that's a relief. It actually sounds fairly amusing!
18923,Oh no!  Did you call your bank and file a fraud charge?
18924,At least you stopped it at $100.  I've heard of others that have lost thousands until the bank could recover it for them.
18925,That is such a noble gesture!
18926,"They will promote you someday, don't give up."
18927,It can be scary out there alone.
18928,That's too bad. I hope things turn around for you soon.
18929,"well, as long as you're happy"
18930,Who is conducting the tests?
18931,How long does the test take?
18932,You and me both
18933,tell me about it
18934,Does it bring back memories?
18935,That is so sweet.
18936,wow. thats amazing
18937,I am shocked either way.
18938,i know right
18939,"now that summer break is over, every week will be like that for me"
18940,Oh really? What's bothering you about it?
18941,"Ah, that is different. I can't remember a time in school that I didn't have a backpack on me."
18942,Wow! What did you eat and how much did you spend?
18943,I am sure it was excellent and not raw!
18944,You are
18945,i had one parent like that
18946,What did they do for you to hate them?
18947,Have you ever tried to use UPS?
18948,I am sure you feel better now that you did it.
18949,Yes and now you can cook without germs.
18950,That feeling is not alien to me. Had been through it in the past. It is truly frustrating looking for new favorite restaurant
18951,I hope you would be able to find a new one as a replacement for your favorite dining place
18952,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
18953,how exciting
18954,what are you guys going to do?
18955,That's interesting. What kind of weird things?
18956,What a wacko! I hope she grew out of it.
18957,I love meeting new people.
18958,Have you ever talked to a doctor about it?
18959,are you gonna stay there for ever
18960,that seems like a long time
18961,"I love taco bell, what did you get?"
18962,I always get a bean burrito.
18963,That sounds so exciting!
18964,I wish you the best of luck!
18965,I have a daughter but she isn't married (yet). 
18966,That's nice but I wonder if it was expensive.  My daughter is one of these millennials that opt for a live-in partner. 
18967,I had a blast in high school. I wish I could go back.
18968,Too bad we couldn't use a time machine.
18969,I really hate that too. It just hurts.
18970,Same here. It's better in the long run if you don't I believe.
18971,That is great. Did you buy him a present for graduation?
18972,What did your brother study?
18973,Why did you do that?
18974,I hope you had fun at least.
18975,Was your friend drunk?
18976,Have you spoke to him since?
18977,sounds like fun
18978,Hey call of duty bets starts tomorrow for xbox
18979,I am also single. I love it.
18980,Were you ever married in the past?
18981,Well trying to compare yourself to the former president is a bit of a jump
18982,Thats fair. Maybe some acting classes would help you loosen up.
18983,That must of been horrible.
18984,I do not drink alcohol at all.
18985,what did they do?
18986,Ive vream works wonders
18987,That is a very bold move.
18988,That's a real shame! You going to do anything about it?
18989,I would feel the same way. I hope it gets taken care of.
18990,I love Nintendo. What game did you play?
18991,I love Super Mario.
18992,Me neither. I get very tense at those times. Were you in one recently?
18993,Oh no that's horrible. I bet that was a scary experience.
18994,"wow, what makes them happy?"
18995,"aha, let them have fun"
18996,How many did the dog have?
18997,Are you going to keep all of them?
18998,Oh congrats! When is the due date?
18999,That is coming up soon!
19000,Well you know how kids are. Probably just forgot and was embarrassed 
19001,Well be gentle but firm. Too much and you will scare her more then likely. 
19002,"Trust me, she probably already knows she made the mistake. Just teach her not to do it again."
19003,What happened on the date
19004,A pro game?
19005,oh thats nothing
19006,Did you keep it or try to find the owner?
19007,Did you spend it yet?
19008,"No, you will never be alone."
19009,What kind of card game was it? I am not even good enough to cheat most of the time.
19010,"Ah yes I have, but it has been a while. "
19011,What is making you feel bummed out?
19012,Can you do anything fun inside?
19013,Do you know who it was?
19014,I hope you do!
19015,Confidence is the golden key to success.
19016,"Hey, socks are fair game,  cant be mad about socks."
19017,"Yeah  guess thats true,  But im always running out of socks."
19018,Did you at least get it back?
19019,Did you have to fight anyone for it?
19020,"that sucks, why did you do it?"
19021,"that is such a bomber, i can relate to thinking you are right but then turning out top be wrong"

19154,oh my! does she know it is broken?
19155,it wasn't intentional ....still a horrible feeling
19156,"Oh my, I am sorry to hear that. are you angry at her?"
19157,"I agree, you have done the right thing. I hope you find someone alot better than her."
19158,Well that's intriguing. What was in it?

19207,How are you feeling about the interview?
19208,What is the job?
19209,Thats inconsiderate. Have you spoken to her about it yet?
19210,Maybe you need to do the same to get even with her
19211,How come? What made you so angry.
19212,Ugh I dislike parents who are so irresponsible with their kids in public
19213,I'm sure you'll be fine. Sell yourself.
19214,I'm sure that will help. I have confidence in you.
19215,what was on it

19229,I bet you are very worried or anxious. Do you need any help with anything?
19230,that stinks.
19231,i can see that!
19232,"Nice, did you feel caring since you did so well?"
19233,You should take care of the pet more often in the future.
19234,Are you? Have you applied to a lot of place?

19242,"Sounds good, today I'll be watching my favorite team play. I am also anticipating the match."
19243,"Yes, they take on Leicester City"
19244,"Oh my, do you feel content with all that sugar in your body?"
19245,"Its okay, you should treat yourself every now and then!"
19246,It's hard. But you will see him soon and nowadays tehre are lots of ways to communicate
19247,Soon you'll remember all the mess he made or food he ate and be a little bit glad :-)
19248,i bet you were frustrated with them. Did you confront them?
19249,I agree. Im sorry for that. I hope they didnt get you too sad. Maybe they thought it wsa theirs for some reason
19250,I agree. Go talk to them and express your frusteration and anger with them. Maybe he will get it. 
19251,Oh no! Did it attack you?
19252,You can always call an exterminator. They should be able to take care of it.

19268,Realy?! What did you do?
19269,Good job! you must be so proud of yourself.
19270,"Hey, if you're passionate about it, then go for it!"
19271,"Wow that's terrifying, maybe next time u should invest in mouse traps "
19272,"Understandable, that's very unfortunate hopefully they will disappear from your home "
19273,Congrats! That would be pretty exciting. Do you have any plans for it?
19274,That sounds like a good plan. How big is your garden?
19275,Nice! How do you pick your numbers?
19276,That's cool. Good luck with your ticket!
19277,what movie was it
19278,oh yea that was creepy
19279,Oh no. Was it an important meeting?
19280,I'm sure it's not as bad as you think
19281,Sorry to hear that. It must make you feel very lonely 
19282,I suppose there has to be a balance of both. To enjoy solitude and the company of others.
19283,Interesting. What was in it?
19284,Cool! Did you eat all of it yet?
19285,Nice. I wish someone would send me a package like that!
19286,Cool! I'd love to be patient like that
19287,Well done to her. I  hope she enjoys the reward
19288,time fof a beat down?
19289,"Nice, what pet was it?"
19290,Sounds very exquisite. You must have cared for it well.
19291,That would be very scary! Were you able to find some clothes?
19292,That's probably the best solution to the problem.
19293,Did you manage to make it on time?
19294,Good job! It must have been stressful.
19295,Have you prepared well for it?
19296,"Nice, be sure to shave and be confident!"
19297,Yeah -  get that sometimes too
19298,True
19299,"I see, do you think you will get the job?"
19300,"Good, you must have prepared well for it."
19301,Really? Was it a ghost?
19302,Phew!
19303,It's lovely. Why did you take care?
19304,"Oh, it's good that you take care of them."
19305,well that stinks for you but good for him
19306,im glad to hear that!!! hard work pays off!!
19307,im very proud of you and the hard work you put in
19308,I don't think you should. Those are often scams.
19309,Usually if you feel that way it is. Try to research alternate cures that actually will work better.
19310,"Wow, did it scare you?!"
19311,"So am I, I would have freaked out if I saw it my bedroom."
19312,I don't mind that - does it freak you out
19313,But you survived.
19314,Yeah - the prices vary a lot
19315,I'm not sure. I think it depends on the dates you want
19316,"No, I've never been there either."
19317,I just Googled it. It does seem beautiful online. Maybe that could be next year's trip!
19318,as you should 
19319,sounds like a pain! Do you know who did it?
19320,"Hm, I hope its not too costly to fixed!"
19321,That sucks! I'm sure it hurt your feelings.
19322,"Oh, wow. I can't believe your friend did that to you. "
19323,I'm sure it can be. Maybe talk to him about it.
19324,Did it wake you up? I would have been so scared.
19325,"Ha! Just next time, make sure you close all the windows before going to bed!"
19326,Oh no. Was it a important speech?
19327,"As King Solomon in the bible would say ""This will pass"""
19328,Oh sad. What did happen?
19329,He shouldn't do this. Is that your dog fine now?
19330,That's really disgusting. I'm sorry to hear that.
19331,Well hopefully you'll be able to get the puppy trained pretty soon.
19332,that is awesome! goes to show that hard work DOES pay off!! congrats!
19333,that type of news makes me really happy
19334,Good luck! I hope you find something good!
19335,How have you been searching?
19336,Very admirable
19337,I'm sue she'll get over it. Your wife wouldn't.
19338,Congratulations! What is he going to do now?
19339,Amazing.
19340,That must be lonely. Do you try to make friends?
19341,I am sorry to hear that. Luckily you can always call them.
19342,Yeah. It's tough sometimes. But maybe taught her a valuable lesson?
19343,Oh  dear.
19344,what type of job you looking for ?
19345,cool
19346,Really? That's awful. Hopefully they understand taht you weren't really yourself.
19347,Don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone makes mistakes.
19348,Sorry to hear that. Were they busy or did they forget?
19349,You should not rely on her next  time. She seems unreliable! 
19350,"Wow, you must have been so surprised! Your parents are so nice."
19351,Well its a nice shock! I wish someone would give me a surprise for once!
19352,I'm very sorry to hear that. I'm hear for you if you need someone.
19353,I can understand the feeling. But being single is great that you don't have to constantly worry about someone else.
19354,hahaha...ive been there and i have done that...what kind of cookies?
19355,ohhh...fancy i dont blame you then. i would have eaten them all too
19356,Congratulations! You must be very happy. Have you met him yet?
19357,Does he have a name?
19358,That sounds exciting! Will you be meeting your old friends there?
19359,Really? That would be pretty fun. I've never heard about my high school having a reunion.
19360,Oh no that's horrible. Did he even ask?
19361,That's awful. I'm sorry that happened to you. Maybe karma will come around on your boss.
19362,What was in the parcel?
19363,That sounds delicious! I wish someone would send me a package like that.
19364,Wow - I've nver been but would love to go.
19365,Definitely. And it never rains in Southern CAlifornia.
19366,"I see, I feel like that sometimes too when my kids leave for college. "
19367,did he do anything?
19368,probably did the wrong thing.. up to no good.
19369,Excellent. How's it been going?
19370,Great - I'm glad
19371,Do you play soccer or watch it on television?
19372,Really? What sort of package are you expecting>?
19373,i would have been fine with that grade too. are you doing well in the class?
19374,i can relate to that. all that matters is you passed
19375,That's very exciting. Have you decided to get one for sure?
19376,"Yes, its good to be prepared. I'm sure when you do get one, he will become a part of the family."
19377,Oh wow! How were they?
19378,Guess you won't be hungry for while
19379,Oh no - how embarrassing. What did you do?
19380,oh no.. is she ok ?
19381,i hope all goes well
19382,That's great! Dod you have any plans for the weekend?
19383,Oh that's horrible. You can always watch a movie or something indoors.
19384,thats awesome!
19385,hard work pays off 
19386,Cool! That's great news. Do you have any fun plans?
19387,Sounds like fun! I'd love to be able to do that. But I get to work all weekend.
19388,that is the worst. i am sorry to hear that.
19389,those medical bills do add up. i wish we didnt have to pay so much to keep ourselves healthy
19390,That is good to have new challenges.
19391,It will be fine. Switching jobs can be scary at first sometimes
19392,Well its not in your hands anymore so its best to stay calm and not worry about it now.
19393,"As it should, but a bad grade is not the end of the world."
19394,Oh wow! I'm really sorry to hear that. That must have been shocking. Have you broken up now?
19395,Oh I can understand the feeling. You should take some time for yourself before you try to do much else.
19396,That is so nice.
19397,Good.
19398,Oh that's really disgusting! Did you still eat there?
19399,Good. They don't deserve your business. You should report it to the department of health too.
19400,sounds great
19401,have fun!
19402,Oh I would be mad at them too! Do you know who it was?
19403,Oh that sucks. You might be able to get the scurity camera footage.
19404,She shouldnt have done that without asking you. But maybe there is an opportunity here for you...
19405,Maybe you can experiment with other women with your wife? Could be fun
19406,Were they good memories or bad memories?
19407,That's a very strong reaction. Still it must have been really pleasant for you.
19408,Oh do they scare you a lot?
19409,Oh me too actually. They are too scary for me too
19410,Oh good luck on it! Are you studying?
19411,Then I'm sure you'll do fine. Just try your hardest!
19412,Did you catch them doing it?
19413,I would be upset if that happened to me too.
19414,hopefully it turns out well
19415,You must have thanked him for it. He is a smart brother!
19416,Good on you. Your brother should consider being a teacher! 
19417,Yeah it can be tough to throw things out that remind us of special people. I still have some toys my grandma gave me when I was a baby.
19418,Yes I do. It can be one of the few remaining physical reminders of the person.
19419,Oh that would be really frustrating. Have you tried to do anything about it?
19420,I'm not sure if you could train bees. You can get one of those protective suits I guess.
19421,That is terrible. Did you tried calling him?
19422,That is very bad person. You should forget about him.
19423,"You must be feeling so anxious, yet so excited right now!"
19424,"You need to keep a cool head though, try doing some sports to relax your mind."
19425,Wow! That's an amazing accomplishment! You must be so proud of him!
19426,That's really great for him. Maybe he should try out for the olympics?
19427,That is great! How did it turn out?
19428,I'm sure it won't be long until your hard work is rewarded
19429,Sounds amazing! Are you going any place in particular?
19430,Beaches are fun! I don't even know the last time I've been to a beach.
19431,that could not always be a good thing
19432,it is nice when it happens
19433,Yes that is incredibly annoying! I'm a quiet person by nature so that can drive me carzy quite fast!
19434,Yes I feel like yelling at them - But that's just something that I would never actually be able to do!
19435,You must be so surprised! Technology has really advanced in the last few years.
19436,"Yep, my son just got me an iPhone 8 and I was surprised at how alien it was to me."
19437,"Oh no, that must have been embarrassing... but it happens."
19438,Wow you might have gotten a little bit of trauma from it. But I'm sure it will fade from memory eventually.
19439,"That is terrible. Probably, he wanted money to buy drugs."
19440,It could be a good explanation but he shouldn't have cursed.
19441,What!? Did they steal anything?
19442,That's no good. Those windows are not cheep either. Hopefully it wont cost too much. 
19443,"It's exciting that you will be able to reconnect with an old friend. I understand that you're nervous, though!"
19444,I'm sure once you see each other and get to chatting it will be like no time has passed! Have fun!
19445,That must have been very scary! Did you investigate it?
19446,lol yeah our minds can play tricks on us when we're nervous. I'm glad it was nothing serious though.
19447,Get yourself some good food and watch a movie! Sometimes it's good to take some time for yourself
19448,"I get you, I've been in your situation before"
19449,That sounds like so much fun! I think you should. I love roller coasters!
19450,I've been on so many. They're definitley worthwhile! At least in my opinion!
19451,I bet your chances are high. Party at a friends or family?
19452,cool well i hope you get what you want 
19453,I'm so sorry about that. That must have really been horrible for her... and you
19454,Wow that often. That must really be stressful.
19455,"Parties are so much fun! Are you celebrating anything special, or is the party just a get together?"
19456,Sounds like a good time! Have fun at the party!
19457,Oh good luck! I hope you're able to win.
19458,I can imagine. Going through the process is very stressful. Do you have an attorney representing you at least?
19459,That is a nice surprise! Did you get charged more later?
19460,I wouldn't either. Lucky day for you!
19461,That really sucks. You can always look into new housing options.
19462,Well do you have enough room to bring in a roomate?
19463,Oh no! and you can't go with her?
19464,Oh ok well she'll be back before you know it!
19465,Oh really? That must have been very exciting to get!
19466,That sounds really entertaining. I've seen those fun coffee mugs with shapes at the bottom.
19467,That sounds exciting! I hope you did well.
19468,I'm hoping for you! I always got stressed out waiting for grades too. Despite knowing that I did well.
19469,Oh no that's annoying indeed.
19470,I'm sure they wanted to be there though. Hopefully they are thinking of you.
19471,Oh no! That's a terrible way to start your day. Did you still go to work?
19472,Well at least you managed to make it through the day. I probably would have just gone home.
19473,that sounds like so much fun!!! staying the night over the weekend? 
19474,Sounds even better than bc I need a bed to sleep! lol 
19475,That is always a bit embarrassing.  Did you blush? 
19476,"That is pretty funny, to be honest."
19477,Oh wow! That must have been a really scary experience. What happened to the spider?
19478,It's a good thing that he was there to take care of it. I just saw a tarantula exhibits at the zoo. Even through the windows that made me nervous.
19479,Oh no! Are you able to retake it?
19480,Oh I'm really sorry to hear that. Was it a big lie?
19481,That's a pretty serious issue. You should punish him somehow.
19482,Like something out of a movie! my god. Did you nail it? 
19483,I am sure you did! 
19484,"am sorry about that, you could have reminded them perharps"
19485,"yah, next time remind them earlier so you dont feel disturbed"
19486,Wow that's funny! 
19487,That's nice. You guys can bond over it
19488,Excellent! Convey my congrats to her. 
19489,Motivate her to participate in more competition like this.
19490,Im so sorry for your loss. Did you have it long?
19491,You didnt keep it in a cage? Maybe you can get another and keep it more secure. 
19492,oh no are you planning to get another one ?
19493,what kind of breed was it
19494,i agree with that.every day is a new start
19495,yes we all do. i really fell you on that
19496,i love listening to oldies. music now isnt as good as it used to be! memories right 
19497,yes they are luckily we will always have them! 
19498,"LOL! Oh no, we're you able to change right away?"
19499,At least it was water and not coffee or juice
19500,Ah that must have been nostalgic. Did you grow up with your cousin?
19501,I see. It's really good you got to catch up though!
19502,Oh really what was the ad about ?
19503,That would be so fun i have always wanted to go but havent had the time !
19504,That's good to hear. Did you sell the old one to help pay on the new one?
19505,"Well, at least you got a new car that doesn't break down."
19506,Wow! That's a great achievement. You must really be proud.
19507,That's great. Sounds like she has a bright future ahead of her.
19508,That could be an unsettling situation.
19509,I hope you had one. That is scary. Are you ok?
19510,Do you live in a house or an apartment?
19511,yeah that was good to helping others. it was a go9d manner i loved it.
19512,yeah it was quite appriciated
19513,Do you have a topic to discuss?
19514,:( fantastic...
19515,"I can understand that. It's usually either parents are happy they are out of the house, or sad that they're gone. I'm sorry you feel lonely. "
19516,I can understand that. Kids have a big presence and their energy creates a void. Hopefully you can find things to take your mind off of it. 
19517,Yes it is. My youngest has been away all this week for his first summer camp. It's been both awesome and lonely. 
19518,Oh wow! what did you do?
19519,Thank goodness for that! 
19520,So then what did you do?
19521,Yeah that's pretty crappy for sure!
19522,Oh no! Hopefully there isn't a mess to clean up when you get back.
19523,Maybe next time you will remember! Haha.
19524,"Oh no! When I misplace things, I try to retrace my steps. Have you tried that?"
19525,Uh oh...I have a cat who likes to steal things too lol Try checking underneath the furniture.
19526,That must be fun for them.  Our neighbor hood only has older people so my kids stay around the house.
19527,"See and i would have though the opposite, but I suppose if they are gone all the time it might get overdone."
19528,"Yeah, I can see that being an issue.  I guess your not as lucky as I was first initially thinking.  Im like you a home body."
19529,That is crazy! He must have got a loan.
19530,He probably won't be able to! Time will tell.
19531,You mean tortures?
19532,it was good habit i like it
19533,that was really bad
19534,Did you try to help them?
19535,There is nothing you can do then.
19536,Is that a prince album?
19537,Well give it back :) Stealing is not right
19538,What happened? Did you uncle drove over the speed limit?
19539,That is horrible. He could have even crashed the car by being drunk. How could you let him drive
19540,"Oh that is quite strange, I hope nothing has happened to them."
19541,"Yea, I would find that rude as well, if he cares about the relationship he should apologize or make it up."
19542,What airplane? Did you know someone on it?
19543,That is really sad. Where was it at?
19544,What kind of car did you buy?
19545,Did you get an insurance check?
19546,"Oh no! That's a tough change, but I suppose you'll have to try to join clubs and make new ones!"
19547,"It's harder as an adult, but you can make some by joining some adult clubs that focus on sports or recreation. Or, if you have a neighborhood club, joining that!"
19548,When will you show your boss the design?
19549,That is a smart move by you.
19550,That's really impressive! What do you like about it?
19551,That does sound really exciting. 
19552,"Thats just the best, i have to plan one of these this fall with my wife"
19553,"I understand , it feels good but when you are away you keep thinking about home and the kids lol"
19554,That's strange. Did you?
19555,Did he walk away afterwards?
19556,Yeah I understand
19557,Oh god..well I hope she left you and you've learned that no one likes a betrayer
19558,That/s disturbing kiddo..you lied and betrayed then you left. You have much to learn about life and how to treat others
19559,"Oh cool, what was the research about? "
19560,"That's interesting, I'm not sure I even knew there were different types of caffeine. Is one type worse than the others? "
19561,How long have you been with your boyfriend?
19562,"That's a long time, so sorry to hear about your troubles."
19563,Wow so close to being out on her own are you a bit nervous? 
19564,Very sad but think of how proud she is going to make you in the good she will be just fine.
19565,That is so true. I feel the same way. It's just nice to know that you work hard for your money.
19566,"i have been slacking but thats only because i moved, i have to start back up"
19567,they are offering a free pass at my gym might take it up
19568,It must be nice to have a house
19569,I am sure it does
19570,I bet. That always happens to me. At least its gone now for you
19571,Your child?
19572,You are excited about this or??
19573,I am sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you
19574,I completely understand! They scare me and I become like a little girl! The rat snakes are great though...I would never hurt them..but I don't want them near me or in eye vision! lol
19575,"LOL! omg..I use that word, I didn't think anyone else did! That is the perfect word for it. I saw a tarantula in the pet store the other day and my skin jumped off of me"
19576,"wow so happy you got it all done, must feel nice right"
19577,that does sound like a lot of stuff going on at once
19578,Oh I bet. Was it your first grandchild?
19579,What a great day that must have been for you.
19580,What will you do on vacation?
19581,Will you stay in a condo on the beach?
19582,That sounds so relaxing! You'll probably sleep great.
19583,That is awesome what was the play about did kids perform? 
19584,I heard of Hamlet that's the one about the prince right I would enjoy to see that being played out in the future glad you enjoyed it. 
19585,"Yes, the cable company is infuriating. Do they eventually help you though?"
19586,That's awful.  That definitely is the worst.  Maybe it's time to change companies.
19587,I am sorry about that. What kind of keys?
19588,Oh wow! That stinks. At least you got new keys
19589,Nostalgic feelings can be nice! I hope you didn't feel sad
19590,That's great! Have you moved out of state?
19591,That would annoy me so much. Can you take it up with management?
19592,What a tough situation. Just make sure and document everything.
19593,What a great accomplishment! I can understand why you'd be happy about that.
19594,You should be really proud of that.
19595,"What happen, did he make it?"
19596,Damn that sucks 😒
19597,"Oh wow, why would she think you stole the money?"
19598,Would she have any reason not to trust you?  I would assume you have not done anything like this before.
19599,Oh god that is horrible! Look in too Bitter apricot and also Chlorella if she does radiation..both have research done on them to help a LOT with cancer.
19600,I can imagine! I have been through it with others. It is terrifying!
19601,Could you purchase one from a local store?
19602,"I see, online is such a convenience but if things get delayed or don't work it becomes an issue."
19603,A race with running or with cars?
19604,"As long as you trained hard and did your best, that is what counts!"
19605,Oh no!  Have you had any luck?
19606,That must be so scary.  I'm really glad you have some good options to try.
19607,"Well hopefully you are a guy? I know how you feel, it feels great to lose weight!"
19608,How much weight did you lose? I have lost over 100lb before. Does feel awesome
19609,which restarant
19610,oh i thought you were eating out
19611,Did your boss understand at least?
19612,That's true. I would be mad about that as well
19613,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had your cat a long time?
19614,I bet it has. They become a part of the family and it can be hard to let go
19615,Did you invite him?
19616,Wow! I bet you had a good time though at your party
19617,will it start you think
19618,i pay 34 but they are pros
19619,I feel you there! I have two broken ones in my driveway! What kind of car did you get?
19620,A new car is a new car :) Just make sure to get it tune ups and oil changes etc on time
19621,I am so sorry about that. How are you holding up?
19622,I bet thats rough. I would be the same way if my dog died.
19623,"Whoops, guess you were embarassed."
19624,Have you been back since ?
19625,"maybe she is getting older, mines a little grumpy as well but i accept it"
19626,"that's not too bad, maybe she needs more attention from you "
19627,Try your local pawn shop for a cheap one you don't want a messy looking yard.
19628,That is crazy maybe you should check offer up and that is crazy I dislike when people steal what is yours especially something you really need. 
19629,That's great to hear! I am happy for you
19630,"That was very nice of them, you must have worked hard to get that."
19631,"Well, sometimes just following orders really well is enough to impress your superiors."
19632,So annoying. Where were their parents?
19633,What a pain in the you know what. I wish the parents could be punished too. Haha
19634,"Keep your head up and keep applying to other companies, something will come around for you."
19635,"It is, but you have got to keep grinding."
19636,where are you vacationing
19637,OMG my dream vacation
19638,What were your favorite movies he did?
19639,That is a favorite of mine too! He was so good in it.
19640,Oh..take it back to them..I have had so many take mine and it's not cool
19641,Thats sickening. Don't steal stuff or you deserve anytime you get stolen from
19642,Are you kicking them out for a valid reason?
19643,Just make it short and sweet.
19644,I would be the same way. Did the snake attack you?
19645,"Well, thats ok. Did you kill it?"
19646,not my favorite time of the year
19647,when i was a kid the adults use to scare me so since then i have not been a fan but i will take my kids tricker treating
19648,That is horrible
19649,It was just a tire he couldve let it go.
19650,I don't kow anything about that. what happened?
19651,That's terrible. I had no idea
19652,"I see. I used to play this game along with Battlefield in the past when in college. Now, I only FIFA only, others do not interest me much"
19653,Good old days of playing these games all nights with my roommates. Now adult life is so different and boring
19654,"Wow, how that happened?"
19655,That is terrible. What did you do then?
19656,Have you seen doctor
19657,Make sure you get them done
19658,The lovely leaves fall from the trees.
19659,Yeah it really is
19660,where are you heading
19661,just keep your money close to you and your passport closer
19662,Its getting real old to see the teams who have the most money keep winning.
19663,Something has to change. Its very annoying.
19664,They've just let me down one two many times.
19665,"It's really a long story, but I won't be going back."
19666,"Okay, but I'm pretty sure we aren't done yet."
19667,Oh really? It's pretty hot where I live. 
19668,Oh wow! That is surprising
19669,where are you heading to
19670,i wish i was you
19671,Same here. Sundays are so much better with NFL.
19672,And this heat can go away too.
19673,"Well, at least you passed. You're both on equal ground now."
19674,"That's great, it'll pay off for her over time."
19675,It is frustrating to work with such people. They should be fired instead of keeping them there
19676,See. They will only hinder the overall performance. You should talk to your manager
19677,I am sorry to hear that. Their is always next time.
19678,I know. I always get that feeling when I don't win the lottery.
19679,Really already!? wow.. what year for you? 
19680,Everything new is always scary. I am sure you are going to do great! Good luck! 
19681,"Oh no, did you file a police report?"
19682,"That is good, glad it will get taken care of"
19683,You have an amazing friend!
19684,Well that's awesome! I bet you will have a great time
19685,"I'm not too sure about it really, but the candy's good! What is it you like about it?"
19686,"Awww, that's precious! Perhaps if I had kids it would be different. They must get so excited about dressing up and going out!"
19687,Thats excellent news how rewarding! 
19688,Im happy for you! 
19689,Was that an issue for some reason?
19690,"Oh, okay. Well then it was a nice surprise."
19691,That can definitely get aggravating! It always seems to happen at the worst time.
19692,"I understand, maybe you can set up certain times or something"
19693,i bet you are excited
19694,havent seen her for a while ?
19695,Amazing! How old is he? 
19696,Adorable so happy for you! 
19697,We get really busy in the Fall with a lot of extracurricular stuff.
19698,"I see, well hang in there. In about 5 minutes, they'll be older."
19699,I love the cool breezes of fall
19700,We spend more time outside in fall than summer. summer is way too hot
19701,I don't even know what that is lol
19702,Sounds neat. Do you usually cook korean dishes?
19703,Oh man. Are they still ok?
19704,That sucks. Must hurt throwing all that away.
19705,now is the time the real growing up starts
19706,oh boy
19707,"Oh, I would have screamed and ran. I hate snakes so much!"
19708,I don't care what kind it is. I will stay far away from them.
19709,So am I! Do you have plans?
19710,That sounds good. I hope you get re-energized.
19711,Maybe she will be .
19712,"Okay, then run for the hills. "
19713,Wow! That's quite the milestone! Any plans to retire?
19714,May as well keep going if you're healthy.
19715,Sounds like you're burned out. Where ya going?
19716,The beach is awesome when the weather is good. Hope you have fun!
19717,I know how that feels. Did everything turn up ok?
19718,Could be worse right? Glad everything ended up being ok.
19719,what was she hiding ?
19720,"that was probably us when we were little lol , my little nieces are the same way and they are such bad actors too"
19721,will you have enough time?
19722,i hope so. It feels good when your day goes smoothly
19723,That's terrible can you reprint them
19724,Same here. I can sometimes remember where I was the first time Ive seen some to.
19725,Some have aged really well though.
19726,seems to be the norm these days allover the country
19727,i get here nearly everday (orl)
19728,I miss that too! I am always telling everyone to get off their phones and be present. 
19729,It is and it wont change not even in my house 
19730,it could come in useful but how often though? is it worth it ?
19731,you never know until you try or you can also do those online courses
19732,I hear ya. I hate it when people check their phones when I'm trying to talk to them.
19733,I know what you mean.
19734,I bet that was a great time.
19735,That is so cool to have those memories.
19736,that's exciting! I hope everything will go good. just be you and i'm sure they will love you
19737,/i love your confidence!
19738,Yea he did some foul things to those people.
19739,I am glad someone stepped up and spoke out about.
19740,is he a nice person the manager ?
19741,"Well, that's good. Did she borrow money from you?"
19742,"Perhaps she's turned over a new leaf. It's very good of you to lend her money, even if she is your sister."
19743,It's surprising how people suddenly wake up and realize that perhaps they haven't been acting as perhaps they should have.
19744,Good! Plan and spend the money as you wish!
19745,Nice! wish you get more bonus in upcoming months.
19746,Well I hope she gets in soon and you guys have a good time together!
19747,Well that sounds fun! Hope she has a good flight!
19748,I hate other drivers.  It seems like they are getting worse every day.  Did you honk at them or anything?
19749,"I would be too.  I'm happy you didnt get into an accident or even worse, killed!"
19750,Oh man. Must be feeling pretty guilty by now.
19751,Just try and be better prepared next time so you dont get tempted again.
19752,That's really good. Where are you flying to?
19753,Nice! Texas is really nice this time of year.
19754,Thats great news.  Did you have to study or is this an area you are already familiar with?
19755,"Awesome, good luck on your test! I hope it all goes well!"
19756,I love cooking. What did you prepare?
19757,"That is trivia. When i am hyped, i cook lasagna. I know that is hard to cook, but i mastered it all on my own"
19758,"that is good, did you like your watch?"
19759,Does it have some cool features?
19760,What is the painting of? It sounds lovely!
19761,Which city was it?
19762,I'm sorry someone passed away.  Did you find a good photo to represent that person?
19763,"Thats very sweet of her.  I'm sure it was nice, although sad, looking back at those memories."
19764,Congratulations! Does it come with a raise?
19765,"Woah, that's incredible! You deserved it :)"
19766,That's a long time to be away. Are you going by yourself?
19767,The opportunity probably won't come along to many times in a lifetime. You should take advantage of it and enjoy yourself as much as you can.
19768,you don't have friends at work?
19769,no partner at home either? work stuff can be really dtressful
19770,Good for you. Are you really close to this friend? I wish I had more close friends
19771,I am also single and there is no one to take me out just to soothe my inner emotional turmoil
19772,That sucks. did he admit to doing it?
19773,Yeah that's true. I don't let people borrow my car anymore. Too big of an investment
19774,Congratulations on that. Hope you have landed the job? Did you?
19775,What company have you applied to? Is it a big player in the industry it operates?
19776,Will there be a next time ?
19777,I'm sorry to hear it went this way for you.
19778,That's a good idea. There's a lot of preparation that goes into a good trip.
19779,So true. I hate it when that happens.
19780,"No, but we are going on a cruise to Cozumel next Spring Break and I think that would be so much fun. Have you ever been?"
19781,That sounds amazing! I bet it was so much fun!
19782,What is your budget?
19783,You could buy a trailer?
19784,Congrats! You must have taught her well :)
19785,"Yum, sounds amazing!"
19786,"Oh boy, how did it go?"
19787,"Congrats, that's a real accomplishment!"
19788,"That's awesome, glad to hear, what are you most happy with?"
19789,A solid and happy family life is the key to a happy life!
19790,"Yes, I hear you on that one."
19791,"Going swimming on Sunday, Relaxing and maybe grocery shopping on Saturday."
19792,OMG I know! It's impossible to sleep :( I'm sorry that happened to you.
19793,Those scoundrels! How can they get away with that?
19794,That's a nice surprise! When was the last time you saw him?
19795,"Aw, that's awesome, I hope you two have a good time together!"
19796,That's great! Keep it up. Weight loss is tough
19797,Haha yup dieting is hard. All I want to do is eat delicious stuff all the time
19798,Woah that's nuts! Have you called to complain?
19799,That's ridiculous! Can you switch?
19800,"That's awesome, I'm with you, I always wished I continued to learn to play the guitar.  It's always a nice skill to have."
19801,"Hey, it's never too late to start up again.  You can always do it as a hobby!"
19802,"Haha, right on. It's nice when they become a little more self-aware and develop parts of the brain that help them realize it's not all about them, and that it's good to be selfless."
19803,"That's the sign of a good parent. You're reaping what you sowed, in a good way. Hopefully it carries on when he's an adult and he becomes another good human being that we have few of"
19804,Oh no! Can you do some gig economy work online to try to make enough?
19805,"Woah that's awful, those things are such a rip off!"
19806,Did they help you?
19807,I'm glad things worked out for you.
19808,Oh yeah? Why is that?
19809,That's awesome! What instruments do they play?
19810,"Oh, that sounds tasty have you eaten it yet?"
19811,"I know the feeling, it's too good to stop."
19812,That's nice. I was never too good at spelling
19813,that's even better. He will be correcting you soon lol
19814,I lost a cat before. Its a lot to deal with.
19815,It get better with time. 
19816,oh wow thats quite a while
19817,oh dang ive never really been in that situation before
19818,wow that is embarassing for them! maybe they had a crazy night and had no time to shower?
19819,oh gosh that is awful! sounds like depression!
19820,That sounds great!  You must have felt really happy!
19821,It sounds like you were quite content and joyful with you time you had with your daughter.
19822,you don't like this dog?
19823,"Oh yes, i completely understand that. Just get some snacks and watch a lot of movies :)"
19824,Ouch! Are you okay?
19825,I'm so sorry!
19826,Awww what's wrong? Maybe going to the lake will cheer you up?
19827,"That is a bummer! Well, you can go next time!"
19828,"You sound like me a few weeks ago with my relatives, since they have a bunch of kids under the age of 10. Sorry to hear you're going through the same stress. "
19829,"Yeah, even if they're not being annoying or bad... just so many people at once and all that activity.. too much. Love to see them come, and love it even more to watch them go."
19830,I had some one tip me a $25 chip at the casino after seeing a pic of my daughter in my locket. I cried lol
19831,Serving tables is hard. some days you can work your hardest and make absolutely nothing. I had to quit after so many years
19832,Do tell! What upgrades have you given it?
19833,Oh that's nice.  What color did you change it to?
19834,That's a great color
19835,I havent done that in ages. How did you do?
19836,Just gonna have to work harder for next time. 
19837,"That sucks, if it had been in the coffee shop maybe it could have been replaced."
19838,They have these new portable cup holders that attach to almost anything. Maybe that can help in the future.
19839,"I can't wait til I make it that far,"
19840,I am only a sophmore
19841,Are you happy or sad about moving?
19842,"Well, I hope you have a good experience in your new city and raise an amazing family!"
19843,"Oh, man!  That is horrible!  What can you do about it?"
19844,"If you can't, it may throw you off by a whole semester!  I would be really mad if I were you!"
19845,"Nice!  Always good to be prepared, makes things a lot less stressful if there is one."
19846,"Florida gets hit a lot! Smart move being ready, but I hope you stay safe regardless!"
19847,What are you doing to improve your self?
19848,So you're improving your self by getting married?
19849,"oh my god, so sad. how did that happen. Feel so sorry for you"
19850,sorry for your loss
19851,"Good job, it's always good to hit the gym and to stay in shape.  I just started again as well."
19852,Just keep at it and I'll do the same! We will be shredded in no time!
19853,That's a good effective walk!
19854,Yeah i get that. I don't go outside for long periods of time.
19855,That's too bad. don't give up though
19856,There will be something you like
19857,You must be so proud of her.
19858,That is great to hear. Sounds like she has good head on her shoulder.
19859,Congrats! What will your new position be?
19860,That's amazing! :)
19861,"I'm jealous of you. I've had a roommate the past few years since I'm in college. First one I had battle depression and mental illness, and even checked himself into a behavioral center because he was feeling suicidal. This recent roommate seems normal enough though."
19862,"I'm glad to hear it. At least you know you're good at being social in some ways. Maybe you can make friends outside of roommates, and then be able to be social outside of your apartment and be able to come home and have the peace and quiet."
19863,Hopefully it is just a sprain. Might not need to receive medical attention.
19864,Ouch man. Just keep it on ice for the evening and reassess in the morning.
19865,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you called IT?
19866,Maybe its time for a new printer?
19867,That sounds fun. What are you most excited about?
19868,I've never been dove hunting. It sounds interesting.
19869,"Uh oh, whose vase did you break?"
19870,"Ah man, that's a bummer, hopefully she isn't too mad and will forgive you!"
19871,What job did he get?
19872,"That's amazing, did he get a job at google?"
19873,Fun friends and good food. Who is your team?
19874,Boomer Sooner!
19875,"Ah, that's awesome, it's always a joy to see a new born baby experiencing it's first view of the world!"
19876,How old are your kiddos now?
19877,That must be nice. You can focus more on enjoying yourself while away.
19878,That is awesome. They must really like you.
19879,"Congratulations! That is great, definitely will help your gpa.  Plan on doing the same this semester?"
19880,"That's the way to do it, you will be thankful you did in the long run!"
19881,"Aw, are they not anymore?"
19882,LOL! I hear that :)
19883,"That's incredibly sweet. That's like the best birthday gift too, since it probably tasted really good, but then showed your time and effort all in one. I heard once to make them taste like a professional made it, you just add like extra eggs and sugar and butter or something"
19884,Damn.. hope when I have kids that they're like you. That all sounds great. You'll probably make all of his friends jealous
19885,Oh my gosh that's disgusting!!! I hate when there are flying things buzzing around Soo annoying
19886,Seriously. I wonder where those babies would have been laid? You probably saved someone's lunch from being a birthing suite.
19887,Did you get a nice prize for it?
19888,"That's amazing, how many people entered?"
19889,"Huge win, do you plan on entering again next year?"
19890,Maybe if there's a hot dog one I can enter it too.
19891,Congradulations you must be very proud of her! What is her degree in?
19892,I think that's great to hear. Does she already have an art gallery started?
19893,I would love to but we can't share images on here :(
19894,I enjoy watching art. Maybe I'll hapen across some of it!
19895,What kind of lunches do you like to pack for them?
19896,Fingerfoods are always good kid lunches. And I hate having to go to the dang grocery store!
19897,Lol! That is hilarious. I hope you got it on video
19898,omg. I love your mom lol
19899,That's never a fun thing to do
19900,Do you know what kind it was?
19901,What job did you interview for?
19902,"That's amazing, you must be so excited right now"
19903,Whoa. What happened?
19904,Oh that is devastating. I hope insurance covers.
19905,I believe there are things in life that are irreplaceable and priceless! There is no amount of money that can give you the true value of your grandfather's watch. I think you should pass it down to your grandchildren.
19906,I consider this a family heirloom and your children would be happy to share this story for years to come.
19907,Wow!  That is amazing!  I guess a little tough instruction and training has paid off!  No need to worry then.
19908,That's fantastic.  It sounds like she has tapped into her inner musical talent!
19909,What is going to happen?
19910,"Oh boy, have a great time!"
19911,"Ew, what did you do?"
19912,"Aw, that's disappointing!"
19913,"Wow, That's unfortunate. Sorry to hear. were you close?"
19914,I hope you are finding ways to cope with your loss. That can't be easy to deal with. 
19915,I hope that helps you and that you find peace. 
19916,I'm guessing she didnt ask to use them?  Has she taken them in the past?
19917,That would be very frustrating. Hopefully she will learn to replace things as she gets older!
19918,"You worked hard, what are you studying in school?"
19919,"I believe you can do it, what do you hope to get a job doing after?"
19920,Amazing. I bet that was awesome. Do you play yourself?
19921,I bet you were having a great time.
19922,Yea that is really far. Give it some time and I am sure you will meet some new people.
19923,It takes time to adapt to a new city. Get involved in some groups to meet like minded people.
19924,"Oh, good luck on it! What are you applying for?"
19925,That's a great attitude to have going in. They really pick up on confidence at interviews.
19926,"Aw, that is really cute of your cat to do."
19927,"It's good to have a pet in your life, makes you happy."
19928,Why not? I LOVE chicken!
19929,Oh no! Maybe the restaurant you ate from wasn't clean?
19930,Its sad. How many rescues do you have?
19931,Well I appreciate you. 
19932,i want to rescue but I have to wait until I move. No pets allowed here
19933,Oh no!  How old was he?
19934,What type of dog was he?
19935,That's gross. Did you make the sandwich yourself or buy it from a restaurant?
19936,"Nasty. That makes me want to not eat there anymore, but I guess it happens sometimes."
19937,I hope you got a refund.
19938,"That is just the worst, who made fun of you?"
19939,That's so disappointing. People should really not be judging others when they don't know how much effort was put in to the outfit.
19940,Hi are you still here?
19941,"It did, what were we talking about again?"
19942,I can understand that. I lost my dog a few years ago. What's worse is I wasn't around when it happened--I was out of the state. I hope you at least got to say goodbye.
19943,"Man.. I'm so sorry. I remember when I was really young, I was in the car with my mom and she hit our neighbor's cat driving home. They just ran right out into the street. She drove home and cried for a while."
19944,"Who knows. They could have been like my mom, and maybe they were different and were too ashamed to say anything. Might not have noticed, either. Or they were just bad people. Hopefully you can focus on your pet and how much you loved them instead of those things you can't get answers to."
19945,... then what?
19946,"Aw, wonderful!"
19947,Well that's good!  What did you all do?
19948,We do something similar at our Thanksgivings.  Did you make a home-cooked meal?
19949,What sorts of pie did yo umake?
19950,"We haven't really done pies in a while, but my grandma makes a chocolate roll and my mom makes some awesome pumpkin bars.  Do you roast your turkey?  We use a turkey fryer for ours."
19951,That sounds pretty awesome.  What did you guys grill?  Was she over for a special occasion at all?
19952,I agree.  I had a cousin living with me for a while until he got on his feet.  I really preferred that over a stranger.  It sounds like you both had an awesome night!
19953,i bet. I miss my friends
19954,That's good to hear. How old is she?
19955,"Hey, you can go out and not pay a babysitter. "
19956,That's good. Were you nervous at first?
19957,Well that's nice that you all get along. you ar actually pretty lucky
19958,Hmm.. what's that mean? Do you feel like you did something wrong?
19959,"Ah, I see. Yeah, that's an easy habit to have. I would be that way too if I wasn't too cheap to spend money. I just try to do a lot of croc-pot stuff since I stink at cooking and am poor"
19960,OH no! Did you study?
19961,LOL! English is a tough subject.
19962,"That is a very big problem to me! However, if you signed a new lease with him it seems as if you can deal with it right?"
19963,Well it seems that you have to deal with him for at least another year. With that in mind I hope you have more than one bathroom. I suggest you let him keep his poop in one without cleaning it up until it starts to bother him!
19964,"Dang, that sounds too good to be true. If you're 100% sure that it's not a scam, and then 100% sure again that it's definitely not a scam (please really really check in every way possible), then I'm happy for you!"
19965,"Whaaat! That was cool of them. If it were me, it'd be torture trying to figure out what to do. Put it into stocks? Savings? Pay off debt? Go on a vacation? I hate making decisions cause I feel like I messed up no matter what I choose. But maybe you deserve a vacation, eh"
19966,Congrats. you are lucky
19967,really? wow
19968,"That's fun, do you think you will enjoy it?"
19969,"Uh oh, well at least you won't be a lone when you watch a scary movie."
19970,Ohhh wow.  I hope you were successful!
19971,What did you get in the mail?
19972,"That is awful, did you miss some payments?"
19973,Whats the reason?
19974,"I'm sorry to hear that, how is he feeling now?"
19975,Nice!!! When are you planning on going?
19976,That's so close. Have you gone jet skiing on that lake before?
19977,I know that feeling! I have 2 dogs and 1 cat. Love them to death.
19978,Yeah! and they are so excited to see you and welcome you home!
19979,Why has it taken so long?
19980,Sorry.. when I first read what you said I read it as Grandparents.. I don't know why.  My brain is tired from work.
19981,"Oh no, how did you end up in that situation."
19982,"Haha, that's awesome, at least you two made it out of it safely."
19983,I would have been so excited lol.  What did it look like?!
19984,Was anyone with you?  Did anyone believe you?
19985,Thats awesome though.  I didn't graduate until I was 40 something
19986,That really is quite an accomplishment.. the type that makes you cry at graduation ceremonies!
19987,"That's very sweet. I was just dog-sitting my neighbor's dogs last week. They were a little annoying at first, but I had to watch and stay with them the whole week, and I really grew to like them. They felt like my little sisters I had to take care of and play with"
19988,"Right, yeah, you just get used to their presence. I hated that they'd bark so much at thunderstorms, but other than that, their little quirks were growing on me. In fact, I miss them right now"
19989,Have you been drinking more water lately? or it's just happening for no reason?
19990,"That would be a good idea, it's better to get tested and treated early if it is anything serious!"
19991,Oh my!  You must have been pretty embarrassed.  Did someone bring you gas?
19992,I'm sure its happened to him before and understands.
19993,Awesome! How was that? do you think she will enjoy high school?
19994,"I know that feeling, I'm waiting for the college to start myself!"
19995,"Aww, that's so sad. I'm sure she would have wanted ya'll to keep having fun times together."
19996,"Yes, it's good to keep bonding. I understand not being able to do it at first, though"
19997,"Oh, man, mine too! It's so annoying."
19998,"Sure does. I think they get a little jealous and just want our attention. They're also very curious about the world, which is a good thing!"
19999,Is there not an upgraded version?
20000,Oh. I know what you mean. I am like that with shoes. I always change my phone
20001,I would have though that your crystal ball would have forewarned you? ;)
20002,Did you keep your receipt?  Maybe you can exchange it or get your money back?  ;)  lol
20003,I feel your pain totally.  I take an online class and I am a teacher at a new school this year
20004,Fun times!  Makes you think back to being in HS.  I am working in a HS this time.
20005,"Nice! I hate looking for apartments. I'm in college and have looked for apartments for the past three years. It gets really old after a while, since I'm on a budget and it's hard to find something cheap but not a rat's nest. Glad you found what you wanted."
20006,I live right next to my campus too! The downside is it's a building made in the '50s and looks terrible on the inside. But I can bear it since I'm saving money. Most college kids have their parents money and just choose a fancier place because they don't care about money. 
20007,I hate that!  Knowing a spider or any sort of bug is in your room and then knowing you have to go to sleep.  I would have done the same thing.
20008,"Haha, while he builds back up his spider web."
20009,LMAO.  LOLOL.  I pay 600 a month.  You?
20010,see it can get worse!  lol... I am paying cash for my classes now but I only take 1 at a time.
20011,"That's sad, well, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! "
20012,"I sort of feel the same way, the older I get, the less I care about my birthday."
20013,"Ah, so are you feeling pretty lonely? That's interesting that he took the dog with him on a business trip, but who am I to judge! Could be viewed as kind of cool that he's that close with the dog."
20014,"Yeah, he should have left the dog with you so not only would you have some company, but some protection, too. But I don't know all of the situation so I guess I shouldn't say for sure! Hopefully it's not for too long so you guys can get back to being a trio"
20015,"Aw, you shouldn't feel bad!  At some point you'll have more cash and do the treating.  There's a lot of give and take in relationships."
20016,"I totally get it.  I bet you think about it way more than she does, though I don't know if that makes you feel any better lol"
20017,What restaurant is it?
20018,What kind of food do they make? Sorry to hear that! That's awful.
20019,Maybe they could get funding from the municipality.
20020,Marked what wrong?
20021,Did you speak with him?
20022,Oh. Well he will probably fix it when he gets better
20023,"Wow, congratulations! That is a really cool endeavor!"
20024,Sometimes it is worth taking a risk like that to have a high reward.
20025,I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully after this project you can get some time off to spend with your family.
20026,"I'm sure your family will understand. And look at the bright side, you'll cherish your next visit even more."
20027,That is always a good thing.  Is it free or a toll road?  Where I live most of em cost money.
20028,Thats awesome.  Saves time and money.
20029,"Nice! School is starting next week for me also, hopefully we both have a good school year!"
20030,"Is this your first year working this job? If so, hope it goes well!"
20031,She is most certainly going to enjoy that!
20032,No special occasion then?
20033,Yay! is it her first year or just excited to get some free time?
20034,"Oh wow, she's must be smart! But yeah, that must be stressful."
20035,Interesting. What is your presentation about?
20036,That's so cool! Is it like a best friend for someone who may be lonely?
20037,"Oh that sucks, I would honk harder at him"
20038,"Yeah, some cities have a lot of people and some really bad drivers. They're rude and disrepectful to all other people even pedestrians."
20039,I hope you goodluck in the future
20040,"One day when you are successful, I hope you pass your good luck forward!"
20041,Oh that's terrible! If you don't mind me asking; Who and why?
20042,Maybe he is trying to do what he thinks is best. I'm sure it's out of love not just being mean.
20043,So he was ok with it? or?
20044,OMG I am so jealous I love fishing.  Where are you going?
20045,Fun times!  I did a little beach fishing not long ago at New Smyrna.  I hope you catch some cool fish!
20046,Have fun for me!
20047,"Oh, bless her heart. I hope you are nice to her."
20048,That's really nice of you for being nice to her. I bet she is happy that you are her co-worker.
20049,"Oh, well that's terrible! Hopefully, your husband was okay and nobody else was hurt. But, it's awful that anyone was."
20050,"Yes, there are many times the emotional pain from tragic events are worse than physical. It doesn't make it easier that it was a person you knew, I'm sure. "
20051,Congrats!  What class?
20052,"You deserve to be happy about that, that is not an easy class!"
20053,That's going to be a pain to fix yourself!
20054,"That was really shady of them to do that, wonder why they did?"
20055,"thats awesome , i have not purchased cds in ages lol"
20056,"i bet that brought back a lot of wonderful memories , from the good old days"
20057,When doe sit come out in theatres?
20058,"Oh I got you, what system is it going out on?"
20059,"Oh no, I hope you was paying attention to what was around you."
20060,That is really scary when you are alone.
20061,"Oh my gosh, what a place to break down!  I was born in ND and I know the dark you are talking about.  Were you stuck for long?"
20062,"Oh yeah, of course.  I heard they are rampant up in those parts.  Did they keep you long?"
20063,I hope they returned you with all your bits and parts.  It would be alarming to find they borrowers from you later!
20064,Oh man truer words were never spoken! How are you gonna spend your free time this weekend?
20065,That's my thought process like every week. I think I might be getting old because sometimes I like sleeping more than being awake.
20066,Oh no! All that work for nothing
20067,Did it at least taste good? lol
20068,That is good that he had an air compressor. Low tires seem to be the story of my life. I seem to always have to be airing up a tire.
20069,They are very handy to have. We got a box that airs up tires and has jumper cables also.
20070,They work really great. Well worth the extra dollars.
20071,Awesome.  Is she going to university after?
20072,That's great to hear.  She'll be flying out of the nest before you know it.
20073,That's awesome! Not too many are able to do that!
20074,"Awesome. I'm glad that she has things going for her, and congratulations to you!"
20075,What type of food do you miss most?
20076,"It sounds like you might be from down south. I would miss it there, too."
20077,What?! Are you sick or your family member?
20078,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, it must have been hard on you"
20079,How exciting!  Who did you order from that gave you such good service?
20080,"I would order again also, that's a good company."
20081,That's great! I went a few months ago and really enjoyed it
20082,I hope you have lots of fun!
20083,wow that's great your are so lucky to see it
20084,How exciting!  Is that your going to be your first time visiting?
20085,"I hope you have a good time there.  Be careful in the interior, it's hot as heck there."
20086,"Aw, was she stressed out?"
20087,"Aw, that's no fun. I bet the constant construction didn't help at all"
20088,Oh wow!  My dog passed away recently too so I can relate to your pain.  I am so sorry for your loss
20089,Most definetly she was my constant companion.  It will hopefully get easier for us each day
20090,"Why do you feel that way?  Has he enacted any policies that directly affect you or anyone you know?  For the record - I'm not too fond of him either, just curious more than anything."
20091,"I agree that he has said some things to suggest that.  However, I do think he has done some good and wouldnt necessarily be the worst president we have ever had."
20092,That is very thoughtful.  Happy Birthday! What did you get from your partner?
20093,Wow!  Now that's one cool gift if I may say so myself.
20094,"Wow, was it?"
20095,That's awesome. Have you been going to school for a while or is this for first semester.
20096,Awesome. Its great. Helps keep down the student loans.
20097,"Yes, Mechanical engineering."
20098,Math and science is my strong suite.
20099,What did you have in there?
20100,"I love veggies, do you know who did it?"
20101,"That's mean of them, they better give it back to you."
20102,I'd still scorn them for their actions.
20103,What's your favorite holiday?
20104,I love that pie!!! It's delicious! My favorite holiday is Christmas. 
20105,"That's good! I think a lot of older people are pessimistic about the future, but I grew up on technology and am excited to see what new stuff comes out."
20106,I think we need more people like you in society.
20107,That's smart. You don't want to forget anything. Are you planning a trip soon?
20108,"What a relief, right? Where are you going?"
20109,I did too. Graduated High School in 85
20110,"Well, that's different then."
20111,Pit stops can be fun.  How did you do on the scratch off?
20112,No way! Congrats!!! I've never come close to that much on a scratch off.  I bet your heart was racing.
20113,"Hahaha, that sounds like fun"
20114,That's great! I like to go dancing too
20115,What type of work do you do?
20116,You must be getting a big pay raise you ole banker.
20117,I hate when that happens.  Did they end up apologizing at all or did they play it off like nothing happened?
20118,I would be too.  Its not fun when a couple people ruin a night that should be a great time!
20119,"That's no good, how did you break it?"
20120,"no good, are you going to get another one?"
20121,"I'd buy it off you after it's fixed, I love tag heuer."
20122,I wouldn't maybe I could get some recommendations for a nice one?
20123,Which chemistry class are you taking?
20124,Yikes. organic chemistry was the last chemistry class I took.     Yuck reaction mechanisms... sn1 sn2 etc.
20125,yeah I wasn't a huge fan of the class.
20126,Depends on what way you're talking about Maybe physics 1 or maybe calc II.  Thats where things really started to come together for how things work +  the math to understand how things work.
20127,What are your favorite parts about your childhood?
20128,That sounds like a lot of fun.  Did you do this with friends and family or alone?
20129,I hope it goes well!  Are you worried?
20130,"Then everything should go fine!  Good luck, I hope you get a raise!"
20131,Do you have a lot of experience baking cakes?
20132,Sounds like fun. Are you excited?
20133,Oh wow I have never been either.  Try not to be nervous!  Who are you going with?
20134,Well I am sure you will have fun.  Just follow the instructors lead!
20135,"That's too bad, did they fit your style?"
20136,Well you saved some money at least?
20137,How come you had to cheat on the quiz?
20138,What did you end up making on the t est?
20139,Where are you guys going?
20140,"That's awesome what a sweet boyfriend, how old are you turning?"
20141,Happy birthday! You must be excited
20142,"My favorite team used to the Bruins, but then I moved"
20143,Did you sit close to the ice?
20144,"Amazing, I love Chara"
20145,"Well, that was absolutely terrible! He certainly picked the worse time to do it. You're right, he was a jerk!"
20146,"Oh, well I'm sorry, that is definitely an unpleasant Valentine's day. But, on the positive side, at least you found out what a jerk he was before you became more committed. "
20147,Thats awesome!  I bet you were really excited!  
20148,You should go out and celebrate
20149,Maybe its time to instill a little discipline.
20150,How old are your  children?
20151,Do you think you'll be next ?
20152,They'd shut down then.
20153,Have you been through many hurricanes?  We stock up in case a tornado takes out the power.
20154,"I've been through quite a few tornadoes.  I live in Missouri, but before that I lived in Kansas.  Have you ever had to use your supplies?"
20155,Yikes!  So far we haven't had to dig into the water or food.  I do debate on getting a generator though.
20156,Aw that's so sweet. Did you find one to make?
20157,Sound interesting! It's a cookie or is it cake-like?
20158,Oh that must be hard.  Are you guys really close
20159,"Man I know how that feels.  When I go to visit my sister and nieces, I have such a hard time when its time to fly home"
20160,You have done such a great job! You should be proud of yourself and not be afraid to do so. 
20161,Don't be ashamed or set yourself short espcially since you worked so hard. If you feel scared or hesitant to do so than I would talk to her boss to possibly set up a meeting.
20162,What sport are you talking about?
20163,"I really do not like hockey, it is boring as hell"
20164,How come you're so angry?
20165,"That is no good at all, how come you did that?"
20166,"Well, I'm sure you are super nervous! Of course, I have no doubt all will be well and a new experience for you!"
20167,"Yes, and worse case, perhaps you can carry something on board to help relax your nerves, just in case. There's always alcohol too!"
20168,Are you excited?
20169,Do you know if you're having a boy or girl yet?
20170,I hope it's a boy I love kids.
20171,Got to get him playing some sports for sure.
20172,That sucks. Did she say why?
20173,Wow that's harsh.
20174,Find a new girlfriend.  That ship has sailed.   If you're really still want her consider trying to play the jealousy card.  (ie; make her jealous)
20175,You don't even have to do that. Keep it classy. Just show up with a pretty girl and have a good time and be a perfect gentleman.  Dont even bat an eye at her.
20176,That's great! How old are your kids?
20177,That's really when they start to come into their own. Must be really neat!
20178,Can you send it back for an exchange ?
20179,"We all make mistakes, just send it back and have it the way you want it."
20180,That's good you have someone that you can talk to about your problems and feelings. I'm sure it helps!
20181,"It can be hard to find the right therapist, so it's great you have found one that really is there for you and helps."
20182,I am sorry you have had a difficult time.  What is EP?
20183,I am so happy you have someone so special in your life!
20184,That's great! Is your position changing?
20185,Oh more money is always good
20186,I'm sure they'll be delicious.
20187,I'm glad they came in for you.
20188,"Well, work can be stressful for many and do that. Often, we can bring it home with us."
20189,That would be very disappointing and frustrating I'm sure. No doubt you wonder why they would do such a thing!
20190,Im sorry to hear that.  How are you going?
20191,"Thats true.  Just remember that as much as it might sting now there are plenty of people out there and you want to find one that makes you happy all of the time, not just some of the time."
20192,Man that is really hard.  I can relate however b/c my sweet Riley(dog) just had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure
20193,It doesn't.  Try hard to stay positive and remember he isn't suffering anymore
20194,Yummy! That's great. It's always nice when you bake something and it turns out just right.
20195,"Well, that's okay. I'm sure it tasted fantastic."
20196,You could always watch it online!
20197,"Don't worry, I will tell Hollywood to make new episodes for you!"
20198,A little jealous much?  Maybe you should pick up a side job?
20199,Maybe you can borrow them?
20200,Good for you. You deserve to take some time for yourself. Anything special on that you want to watch?
20201,Sounds like it's going to be a good night. Enjoy.
20202,"Oh wow, You think you baby might be a little sick?"
20203,"I'm glad to hear it. It's always nice to get a little ""me"" time to get things done."
20204,They are very busy but if she made an appointment with you then she should be there on Monday.
20205,"Oh no, you are leaving the neighbors to terrorize some unsuspecting people. That is funny."
20206,Omg..You should get out fast as you can then. Everyone can't be trusted.
20207,"Oh no, I hate situations like that, when you still have to see people like every day, ugh."
20208,Don't show your anger at all  or let her know it got to you.
20209,"That will bother her more I believe, lol."
20210,How old is he? Is he mature?
20211,I am happy for you! I hope you keep being friends forever!
20212,I bet she was really happy about that. 
20213,"Yikes, that would drive me crazy."
20214,"It would drive me crazy also, she should be more considerate. "
20215,Maybe she will start paying on time.
20216,That's awesome! Did it cost you alot?
20217,Well I'm glad that it worked out for you!
20218,I would feel the same! heights are scary
20219,"lol! Well it's ok, it's not like you need to do anything with heights- unless you have to fly a lot. I do..but I don't like it"
20220,I feel you on that. That is awful. Is there anyone above him?
20221,You want to make trouble?
20222,"Oh ok! I see. Well you're not making trouble anyhow, he is"
20223,Why this happened? Is he bad at what he is doing?
20224,That is terrible if he blamed you.
20225,It will feel good when it done though!
20226,And your hard work will pay off!
20227,Sorry to hear that
20228,Cool. What did it look like?
20229,Are you going to display it?
20230,Well that's nice. Maybe you can pass it don to your kids too
20231,That sounds really nice.  Did you have fun?
20232,"Ugh, that's terrible.  I hope you found the money!"
20233,"Sounds like you will! You sound confident in yourself, and I'm sure your manager is, or he wouldn't have trusted you to do it."
20234,Definitely. Hopefully lead to a promotion for you soon!
20235,Why do you think you will fail?
20236,When is the test? Practice makes perfect! Fit it in!
20237,How much did you pay for the new one?
20238,"That is a great bargain, Will you use it tonight?"
20239,What things are you looking forward to?
20240,It sounds like your positivity will bring about something good
20241,How does she help you out?
20242,She sounds like a great girlfriend
20243,i haven't played video games in so long.
20244,i agee. i used to loooove playing mortal kombat.
20245,"I get that, I guess you can just bring cleaning supplies!"
20246,Why didn't you finish?
20247,Oh. It's not too late is it?
20248,What has she been lying about?
20249,Are you going to punish her?
20250,What does he ask about?
20251,Wow. That has got to be annoying. I can never finf my landlord
20252,Why didn't you wore them?
20253,That is sad. I hope you find them.
20254,How'd they ruin it?
20255,"Sounds like a mess, were they punished in some way? "
20256,"Oh, I hope you seek help for that"
20257,I am not a football fan. What did they do last season?
20258,That is super cool. I hope they win this one too.
20259,How'd she pass away?
20260,I used to play that game with my little cousins
20261,Cool. I never have time for video games any more
20262,"Wow that is impressive, how old is she?"
20263,"That is impressive, congrats on raising a smart kid!"
20264,Call of duty?
20265,I used to play
20266,I might check it out. Get back in the game.
20267,you didn't make them clean it up?
20268,Very cool! Have you ever done yoga before or would this be a first time?
20269,Cool!  I've heard it can be tough but I think it would be fun to try out!
20270,OMG! I don't blame you. I would be extremely upset also.
20271,Mine does also! It seems like it just keeps getting worse and worse. 
20272,YES! I hate it. I can't wait till this dark time in our history is over. Hopefully a few people end up in jail! 
20273,I don't take death well either!
20274,Some act like it never happened. A lot of apathy going around. You'll see her again someday!
20275,"That is certainly a blessing, good for you!"
20276,"I get that, but I hope that continues for you!"
20277,Are you happy now?
20278,Well that's good. IT will come it you work for it.
20279,How many do you have now?
20280,"Oh, well there you go, good choice!"
20281,I probably would have tried to shoot him thinking he was an intruder
20282,I understand. I had that problem when I was kid. Now it is ok.
20283,"Anyway, you can watch other movies."
20284,You feel liked now?
20285,Why did you not get driven there?
20286,"Wow, that is not safe at all for a kid though"
20287,That is great! I bet you are feeling very good.
20288,It takes a while to feel that great. I am almost there.
20289,sorry to hear that
20290,"Gotta play to win, that is what my grandma always said"
20291,"Best of luck with it, if you hit it big slide a few million my way haha"
20292,That's nice. You guys hang out a lot?
20293,Keep it up. You guys can be in each others' weddings lol
20294,"Oh, that looked decent, hope you like it!"
20295,What did you do to him after?
20296,What'd he say to that?
20297,Same here. I can't do it
20298,"I don;t even try, I can barely watch suspense movies"
20299,Their toddlers were in the street? I feel like that is almost CPS level issues
20300,What did you do? Sometimes I just sleep and that is enough for me
20301,how did it work out for you?
20302,good luck i hope all goes well
20303,"I am sorry. Maybe not focus as friday-sunday as the weekend, but as any other day. And do things you would normally do on other days."
20304,That is a tough one. What do you normally do other then work on those days?
20305,"Is there anything else you do besides work? A hobby you enjoy, video games, music, working out?"
20306,"Healing is never easy. It always has the negatives. Any sort of healing always starts with pain, a open wound, and itchy scabs, and the left over scar. I wish I could talk to you daily and help you get through it. I know its hard to go and do things alone. I recently discovered a text number that allows you to talk to someone when you are feeling down. it is 741741. I have used it just recently myself. It does work and is better then nothing. "
20307,"(Thank you for your words! I have a mom to talk too, so it helps but loads of trauma, abuse and death are hard to even talk about. Thank you! I hope you feel better too!) I have had to talk to customers who were nasty to clerks before! It's shocking."
20308,"I know right? Oh lord- the food industry is the worst, especially for waitresses."
20309,Ohhhh yum!  What are your favorite toppings?
20310,That's what I get too!  I also get vegan cheese...its delish!  Hope you have a great time chowing down tonight!
20311,"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you reschedule?"
20312,"I hope you guys will still get to spend quality time together and of course, get some rest in."
20313,how did you manage
20314,yea
20315,"Oh, why did you go that way?"
20316,Wow that sounds scary and horrible. What was it?
20317,Oh I see. I'm glad the police came and took care of it. Sounds like a scary experience.
20318,"If you go into it with a good attitude, I'm sure at the very least it won't be bad. What kind of classes will you be taking?"
20319,"Ooof! Best of luck to you, I'm sure you'll be fine. Math was never my strong suit."
20320,Why do you like the eagles?
20321,"I understand. I hope that they will win again,"
20322,What did you argue about?
20323,"That is smart, sorry that is happening to you!"
20324,What movies do you like to watch instead? 
20325,Any favorite actors? 
20326,"Hahahaha, that is the way sumer is supposed to be for kids.  Did they at least do the things you asked them to do?"
20327,"Ohh no, its worse than I thought.  It's one thing to relax, but that's different.  What are you doing to whip them back into shape?"
20328,That's terrible. Where?
20329,Oh no! that's really terrible.
20330,They arent that bad
20331,Watch in the day time with the lights on and the tv volume low. That's how I got into them
20332,Are you happy or sad about that?
20333,"Oh, well congrats then haha"
20334,what part
20335,I love seafood buffets
20336,lol. thats an oldie but goodie
20337,That is so cool and thoughtful!
20338,yuk.. did you pull it out and continue to eat?
20339,smart move
20340,Why? What happened>
20341,Aww that sucks. Did you find him?
20342,How big was it?
20343,"Well great job, get something nice with it, you deserve it!"
20344,"Oh yeah, I can't take scary movies of any kind.  I used to watch some of them when I was in my 20's.  What kind of movies do you like?"
20345,"Yeah, they are way better than scary ones. Seems like there are horror movies coming out every other day now a days."
20346,Not at all. It is kind of boring being left to clean everything alone.
20347,And you might get called a weirdo. Haha
20348,"Oh man, that's awesome! What concert were the tickets for?"
20349,"Well, I hope you have fun! I'm almost completely deaf, so I don't know that much about music."
20350,what do you think is wrong?
20351,ah i am sorry for that! hoping for the best!
20352,I hate that
20353,What is the purpose of that!
20354,That is nice. Did you know the restaurant before going there?
20355,That is super cool.
20356,"That is great, congratulations on the new place.  Is it somewhere you have wanted to move for a while now? "
20357,That is so nice.  When do you move?
20358,I'm sorry to hear that. Why was that?
20359,Well that really stinks.
20360,thats awesome that it works for you
20361,"That's really good! Did you lose weight, or have you just not felt comfortable with yourself before?"
20362,"That's awesome! The best part of that is looking good is only just a side affect of being healthier in general, which is great to be."
20363,Oh that stinks. Does she live far away?
20364,I completely understand that. I'm so busy I hardly socialize at all.
20365,That is sad. Do you have other children?
20366,"I understand. Anyway, he will keep visiting."
20367,Oh wow! Did you get your money back?
20368,Oh good luck with that! Next time use airbnb or vrbo
20369,"Wow, that is impressive, I could not do that at that age"
20370,"Wow, she has a bright future ahead of her if that is the case"
20371,Why its okay to be differnt
20372,If he is rich then I am jealous of him too
20373,That sounds upseting. Why were you scared?
20374,Oh man well wear silver. That can supposedly burn them and scare them away. 
20375,yea that sounds like a plan
20376,"I feel you!  My two kids know all the rules and yet, they just go out the window when they want to take something or use something that isn't theirs.  I always joke that you can't have nice things with kids."
20377,Seriously!
20378,Congratulations! Are you having a party?
20379,That's sounds nice and romantic
20380,That game was fun to watch last year. Do you live in Philadelphia?
20381,"I love it there. I don't normally like football, but it's always good when the Patriots lose."
20382,No one has ever given me a car. That must be nice
20383,That very nice of them
20384,What did they do to it?
20385,"Kids are like that sometimes, sorry about that"
20386,"Oh no, this is a classic office disaster story. How bad was it?"
20387,"Ah heck, I hate that for you. Hopefully it isn't as bad for you as it seems, but just know that that mistake has happened to several people that I know of, so you're not alone."
20388,That sounds awesome.  I barely remember 3rd grade.  I think we just played games and had fun.
20389,Wow thats so deep.  I cant imagine having to deal with that at that age.  They mustve been what like 8?  thats a lot to put on a kid
20390,What did he say?
20391,Why would he even do that?
20392,That's great! I hope their marriage goes well.
20393,Well that may be difficult if you aren't married first.
20394,Cool! What kind of business?
20395,Wow that's pretty ballsy nice job!
20396,That is awesome.  Is she a doctor?
20397,How much longer does she have in school?
20398,Really? What you got going on?
20399,That will be so much mush. He is going to have a great time.
20400,Aww that was nice of them!!
20401,lol.  Maybe they all came into work early just to surprise you!
20402,"That is great, do you get to see them much?"
20403,"That is really good that you get to see them all the time.  Do you have kids, too?"
20404,That doesnt sounds like a surprise
20405,Oh you just know that there's something going on. That's pretty cool
20406,Yeah that is pretty upsetting. I don't get what is so hard about throwing away your trash. 
20407,Maybe the kids will see all of the trash and see that it is bad and grow up to not  litter?
20408,Oh yeah those shows can fascinating!
20409,"It's true, but I also can't help but watch. It's exciting to learn in any case."
20410,Who's car was it?
20411,What kind of car did she get you?
20412,That is amazing that you got tickets.  What was your favorite part?
20413,That is awesome.  How far in advance did you have to buy the tickets?
20414,That's exciting!  I hope he's doing well in school!
20415,Nice i love football.
20416,Oh cool!  Is he going to let you drive it?  lol
20417,Maybe you can swap Toyotas for a day :D
20418,Yeah me too. Some people have some amazing talents. 
20419,Yeah magic is pretty great!
20420,Those movies are amazing.  I loved the last one with Thanos.  He was a cool character.
20421,I actually started to understand where he was coming from...in a sick kind of way.
20422,That's sad. What country is that?
20423,Wow that is far. When did you come here?
20424,What is it like over there?
20425,Yeah I can imagine it would be simpler there.
20426,Awww I completely understand. I remember that feeling. And mine is now a senior. Time flies! Cherish every moment with him!
20427,I only have one. And next year he'll be going off to college. I wish I didn't have to work so much so I could have spent more time with him when he wanted to
20428,Yea that would have been great if I could have done it. I'm happy that you do!
20429,It's still better that an empty house!
20430,That sounds so sad.  I hope he was ok
20431,You have to be careful though.  Sometimes people can be really dangerous when they have nothing to lose
20432,Why did you want to do that?
20433,That makes a lot of sense. Sometime that's just how it goes though. 
20434,"Oh wow, are you okay?!"
20435,"I hope so, and I hope you do good in the tournament :) Just rest that finger and let it heal."
20436,Oh no :(  I hope there's someone you can stay with
20437,From me?  But why lol?
20438,Oh.  That sucks I'm sorry :(
20439,Whar happened?
20440,That is very nice. What are going to do with money?
20441,"He must be a super hero, I would have offered to help him haha. "
20442,"I wish I could have seen that sight, ask him for his workout schedule."
20443,Im so sorry. Thats horrible. I cant imagine how you must feel
20444,"I know you cant ever replace him, but Would you consider getting a new dog?"
20445,Yeah I stole money of my mom's dresser once. 
20446,Wow that's really rough. It was only $5 but she was still really upset about it. 
20447,That is weird. Did you say anything?
20448,Well that is pretty gross.
20449,"What movie? I can't watch scary movies anymore since having kids, they are too realistic now haha"
20450,Thank you for the heads up! Maybe sleep with a night light on tonight :) Sweet dreams!
20451,Oh no!  Extra workload is terrible!  Did you make it through?
20452,I bet.  Did you relax when you got home?
20453,That's a killer end to a stressful day!  
20454,"Oh! I thought it was something bad, I hate roller coasters too!"
20455,That's kind of sad.  What makes you reluctant?
20456,"Well I'm sure the odds are against him, but I hope he succeeds this time."
20457,"Man, I wish I had the money to afford a boat, I don't know about you."
20458,Imagine days spent cruising around on the water!
20459,You got this girl! I was induced when I had my daughter a year ago! I was scared too but honestly don't remember much.
20460,"Just enjoy and rest on your last weekend before baby, It'll all be worth in when you are holding your little girl :) Don't listen to those scary stories, those are the 1 in a million chances it goes wrong!"
20461,That's awesome! What kind of restaurant is it?
20462,Oh those are great and a lot of times they make everything fresh! What is your favorite meal there?
20463,Did you find any?
20464,Wow
20465,That's super frustrating! Did you walk out?
20466,That's the bit I kind of don't like about restaurants. I get why they don't let you get your own beverages but at the same time it seems unnecessary to have to wait for someone to refill your glass.
20467,"Wow, are you ok?"
20468,"Hahaha, that must've been pretty funny though. Im assuming he/she helped you up?"
20469,"That's good, where was it?"
20470,What would you do with friends? 
20471,"Sounds like you lucked out, make sure she knows how special she is :)"
20472,"Yes, don't let a night go by without saying I Love You."
20473,That makes a lot of sense. I wouldn't be happy either! I hope that they have good insurance
20474,Wow! That's aweful. Is your mom ok?
20475,Man that really does stink! Hopefully the police will find some way to catch the guy!
20476,What kind of tricks can you do?
20477,Thats pretty cool! I am fascinated by that!
20478,Does he have a bad back or was it just an enormous thing?  Did you get to go over?
20479,Oh my goodness!  That's awesome!  Does that feel weird to know he's going to be a Dad?
20480,Those have got to be some good memories for you!
20481,Yeah life really comes at you fast huh?
20482,Whats happening tomorrow?
20483,"Oh wow that sounds like fun, your a great uncle!"
20484,Kids can be so annoying sometimes.  I hate those shoes with wheels that they have.  so annoying
20485,I just saw a girl wearing them at walgreens tonight.  I wanted to trip her lol
20486,What rides did you go on?
20487,I hate rollercoasters too!
20488,"Sounds relaxing, being a mom I could use a day like that! "
20489,"I hope it was a good day for you, atleast you did something productive and got some laundry done haha"
20490,That's pretty gross. It happens though. Did they comp you?
20491,Great! They should get a great review as we all have hair everywhere. It's bound to happen at  some point.
20492,How long have you been sick?
20493,"Wow, that's a lot. Is it clearing up?"
20494,Wow!  Impressive!  He must be beaming and you must be so proud!
20495,I bet his face was priceless when he found out!  Those are the best times in life!  Take him out for vegan ice cream!
20496,I'm impressed you didn't explode!  My wife would've gone insane.  She hates that kind of stuff.  How long did it take to clean up?
20497,"What I've found is everything is salvageable if you really want/need to.  I recommend looking on YouTube to see how to remove the oil from the fabric.  Keep your head up, you'll be alright!"
20498,I know there will be something on there!  YouTube has taught me more about life than my parents.  In 20 minutes you will know how to clean your couch and take the engine out of your car.
20499,oh those places are fun.  Its like dinner and a show..  Was it expensive?
20500,thats smart.  We went to one for my wifes birthday once and it cost a fortune!
20501,Are you moving?
20502,"I went on vacation about 4 months ago, it was really fun. I went to Orange Beach, AL"
20503,They are really bad especially if you have pets.
20504,"Yea. You have to be careful with flies, because they can lay eggs in your pet's food."
20505,I have never tried it
20506,"Wow, you must be proud! How old is he?"
20507,They grow up so fast! Glad he isn't scared anymore.
20508,You got a day off? Man I wish I could get a day off
20509,Was it fun?
20510,how did it turn out
20511,thats cool that you made it through
20512,Oh boy!  Congratulations are in order then?!!  How many kids do you have then? 
20513,"I totally get it.  If I found out that I was pregnant right now, I'd pass out and cry for a few minutes and then be happy.  ha ha.  I pray for your wife and her body! he he."
20514,I would be disappointed in him if I were you.  He sounds like a real low life.  Maybe you should kick that bum to the curb.
20515,"I don't, if it were up to me we would all be artificially inseminated and men would be kept like livestock."
20516,Cool!
20517,sheesh thats a great deal! 
20518,how many packs did you stock up with? lol
20519,"Why, What happened?! I hope your dog is okay."
20520,"Oh man, I'm sorry. My two dogs are my babys, I can't imagine how you feel."
20521,Is she?  That's pretty awesome!!  How'd you land her?
20522,Sweet!!!  Did you have a good time?
20523,Yeah I bet.  
20524,10th grade was a good year.  I met my favorite girlfriend that year.  Is he excited?
20525,thats so cool.  what position is he playing?
20526,That's awesome. Will you be relaxing at home or elsewhere?
20527,"I love camping. Hopefully, you won't meet too many mosquitos!"
20528,That's awesome! Are you going to go see it?
20529,Wow that's a long way to go. It's really cool you have one opening up near you. 
20530,Congrats! A day off is always nice.  Did you do anything fun with your extra time?
20531,"Haha, relaxing days can be super helpful.  I hope you have a good rest of your weekend!"
20532,That sounds nice! Do you enjoy your new home?
20533,That makes a big difference. Getting your feng shui on the go!
20534,$20 bucks?  I'd try to do it too.  How'd it go??
20535,Awesome!  He'll know not to challenge you next time!  $20 bucks richer!
20536,is this her first one?
20537,Where'd everyone go?
20538,hahaha did you kick family or roomies out?
20539,That sucks. What's going on next week?
20540,I don't think anyone enjoys going to the dentist.
20541,aww im sorry.  did they leave without you
20542,That was really nice of them.  you have some really good friends
20543,"That is so scary, what happened?"
20544,"Wow, that is scary! Be careful."
20545,Ohhh Congratulations!  I am sure you will be ok.  Is it your first?
20546,Think of how many people have babies.  If they can do it so can you!
20547,did anyone see ?
20548,oh well you lived through it!
20549,Really? Why was that?
20550,Well there are some good safety apps for your phone that a friend can monitor you as you walk home. Maybe you want to try one of those. 
20551,That's what mom's do! I think it's in our blood.
20552,"That is true,not all moms are that way and that is sad."
20553,That's fantastic to hear!
20554,"Wow, must've been scary"
20555,That's good at least
20556,That's crazy! I wonder if he's stocking up or is cooking for a lot of people.
20557,2 bags and I'm already struggling.
20558,make a plan to pluck her away
20559,"dump the first, and go for her"
20560,That's really awesome! Cat's are like the best pets ever. 
20561,Oh... I didn't know those were real. 
20562,"Did she pass away, or did something else happen?"
20563,"That's sad, one of my friend's dog died a few years ago. We were all very sad because he was such a nice pit"
20564,I don't really trust dealerships. What's wrong with your car?
20565,Ah you're getting maintenance done. That's good.
20566,That is so exciting and different.
20567,"I bet so, that doesn't happen often."
20568,I'm sorry to hear that!
20569,Good luck. Maybe a better opportunity will come around.
20570,"i can relate my brothers ex wife , uses all the child support money on her self and her crack head boyfriend , my brother buys my nieces close and toys because she wont"
20571,"its horrible to hear , but i agree with you 100 percent some people should not have kids at all"
20572,That is some dedication.  Did he finally heal up?
20573,I'm glad to hear that he is better now - you did a great thing by helping him.
20574,oh no thats terrible. where do you live?
20575,oh yeah that could be dangerous!
20576,That's really awesome that you have a great partner like her!
20577,Yes I am and my wife is awesome too!
20578,Sharks are definitely scary.
20579,Is where you went known to have sharks?
20580,"Wow, that's very nice of them! Someone taught them well."
20581,"Yes, each kid has their own personality sometimes. I've seen some families that had some kids that were angels, and one of them was a nightmare!"
20582,I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is comfortable at least.
20583,Do you have plans on how to spend these last days with her?
20584,Oh man! I bet you felt bad. 
20585,I am sure she understands it was an accident.
20586,That is so good to hear! What makes her so great!
20587,You have a great wife for sure then.
20588,do you have to pass the gre? 
20589,your husband could probably help you with the math portion!
20590,gotcha... bock bock chicka chicka 
20591,What have you used them on so far? 
20592,They sound like good knives
20593,Did he like it?
20594,They grow up so fast! You must be proud of them though.
20595,Do they bother your stomach?
20596,"Oh goodness, so you have an allergic reaction to them then?  Do you have to carry an epi pen just in case some slip by you unaware?"
20597,Significant others can be hit or miss sometimes.
20598,Your husband sounds like a keeper. How long have you two been together?
20599,Have you made an appointment with your doctor?
20600,I would just to be safe!
20601,"That's very true, but I'm sure their both very smart and know how to avoid dangerous situations. "
20602,That will be great! A little peace of mind is all you need. 
20603,thats awesome! what college you go to?
20604,holy smokes thats legit! 
20605,"Wow, that's a terrible situation. Did you report it to the police?"
20606,Well that's no very helpful. What about cancelling your card at the bank and reporting fraudulent charges? 
20607,My best friend just told me that they are planning to get a sex change. I had no idea!
20608,He is planning to be a she as soon as she can get the operation scheduled with the doctor. I think I will take at least a few months.
20609,thats awesome! do you guys raise multiple horses?
20610,i would love to be able to have horses
20611,Yes it is very disgraceful.
20612,I know. It is so hurtful to so many involved.
20613,A sub for what?
20614,Oh that sounds good. The closest sub store we have is SubWay.
20615,He must be so precious!
20616,Cherish him while you can. They really grow up fast.
20617,Wow. That's crazy. What even happened?
20618,Someone should definitely report him.
20619,"how do you feel about it ? honestly if someone is respectful to me i dont care who they like , thats the way my dad raised me "
20620,"im straight but the way my dad raised me , he said to respect all sexes , and what ever religion i choose was up to me , i have never gone to church "
20621,Oh no!  What happened??
20622,OMG who was it?  What did they do??
20623,AHH!!  Did you call the police?
20624,Did he hurt you??
20625,A trip sounds great! So where are you going?
20626,Florida is a great state to have vacation fun! Can you bring me a seashell back? 
20627,Lol...Thank you the kids and I love to listen to the sound of the ocean through them.
20628,lol i know the feeling. how great would it be to hit a jackpot though
20629,shoot you aint the only one!
20630,I like the Ravens.  People always get hurt in football..
20631,No I my boyfriend had on the Dolphins.. BLAH lol
20632,You must be so excited and proud!
20633,Has he talked yet?
20634,Awesome! I wish I was a better cook.
20635,I believe that!
20636,That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that. Is he getting a treament? 
20637,"Wow, that's awful. I hope you can tell her all about him and share some pictures at least. "
20638,"Wow, that's not something I'd expect to see just looking out my window at the street!  Were you impressed?"
20639,Ha!  Well just make sure you've got good insurance on all of them first!!
20640,Congratulations! Was it your last final?
20641,Good luck. It'll be worth it.
20642,"Oh no, have you tried talking about it?"
20643,Give her a few days and try again
20644,That is really great to hear! Couples break up so fast these days.
20645,uh oh how does Facebook help? lol
20646,Did he get it fixeD?
20647,Yeah that's good.  You're a good friend.  Good on you lad!
20648,Oh wow! Congrats! That's awesome!
20649,I would love to go someday.
20650,Ut oh.. are you nervous?
20651,I'm sorry.  Don't worry.  It never is as bad as you think it will be.
20652,I cannot imagine how scary that would be!  Were you home or away?
20653,"Do you mean your security system, or do you mean that which keeps your family secure?"
20654,Definitely.  Did you make any adjustments to prevent or protect yourselves after this horrific event?
20655,That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a great time?
20656,"That was very thoughtful, you are very lucky!"
20657,That's awesome. Is it your favorite band?
20658,You must love music. Are tickets expensive?
20659,man thats legit! i am so lazy lol
20660,i run 1 10k a year lol
20661,that is incredible! congrats is she your first?
20662,its so awesome to have a child! my son is a little over a year
20663,She sounds wonderful. How long have you two been together?
20664,That's really amazing. I wish you two the best.
20665,"Haha, that's funny. The same things used to happen to me except with the game Resident Evil. I love that game, and was scared to play it at the same time."
20666,Yes! I remember that. I was just looking at getting an emulator so I could play it again on my computer.
20667,"i love art if thats what you mean , i started taking painting classes recently "
20668,"Thats awesome i used to do the tattoos and recently purchased 2 tatoo machines a shader and a liner , been drawing since i was 5 years old"
20669,I'm sorry to hear that. 
20670,I wish you healing and comfort.
20671,That's wonderful! What's been going on?
20672,Oh my gosh. Congratulations on the kiddo!
20673,What are you scared of?
20674,I bet you are scared! It will be fun though!
20675,Hey that's great of them!!  Did you get anything cool?
20676,"That's fantastic!  What an awesome day, huh?"
20677,"hahaha I guess no one warned you about how scary that movie is, hu?"
20678,Good idea. Having someone around might help you recover from it.
20679,Oh no! That's no fun. So you're cancelling it completely or will you wait until you feel better?
20680,"That's too bad, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon!"
20681,how exciting! I love concerts
20682,Honestly I can get into most kinds of music. What artist/band is the concert?
20683,thats awesome! glad to hear that!
20684,it does i agree! its always great when someone gets paid for their hard work
20685,"Oh wow I'm sorry, but your health is more important!"
20686,Sounds like you have a great friend! 
20687,"I used to have to be on call and I hated it, especially after I worked all week."
20688,"That's true, that is part of it, I guess."
20689,Oh that's sweet. What kind of things does he do?
20690,Oh that's very nice! He must work very hard then!
20691,"Could be better, but it's nice to know someone is having a great week!"
20692,"Oh now I""m just getting jealous!"
20693,Oh?  How was it?
20694,That's awesome!  Nothing better than free food!!
20695,"what artist is gonna be there, now i am intrigued "
20696,"ooooh nice , i would be so pumped too see them , enjoy"
20697,ah no thats horrible i hate to hear that
20698,thats legit! i love mma and jiu jitsu is crucial 
20699,"Are you excited about that, do you think you'll be checking it out when it opens."
20700,We have a local pizza place here and it is SO much better than all the chain places.  I hope your's is great also.
20701,Oh I'm so sorry. Is the little one being treated?
20702,I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she had the bests life she could being part of your family.
20703,you going one last time ?
20704,yea 
20705,Oh no. Do you know who did it?
20706,A hit and run. Not many people are responsible anymore.
20707,"Me too, people can be so cruel."
20708,It definitely can be.
20709,that is scary! it happened to me as well so i bought a couple of guns
20710,"yep us too, its sad we have to have those"
20711,It's always nice to have people around you that care about you. They make hard times much easier.
20712,How's the wrist feeling now? Any permanent damage?
20713,"Well take it from me, I have one and twins on the way.... Never wanted kids either but once theyre here it's an amazing feeling!"
20714,You will never be ready but enjoy as  much as you can while you're young! lol
20715,"So exciting, which concert?"
20716,Nice! I don't know either band well but sounds exciting!
20717,Good luck! Chess is such an interesting game.
20718,"Is he an awesome player, too?"
20719,"That must be nice, having a good family."
20720,Do you have any siblings?
20721,That is kind of sad. I hate it when places from your childhood close or are torn down.
20722,Yeah that is too bad.
20723,Oh yea? How'd it go?
20724,"Oh no, how did mom take it? Did she tease you?"
20725,"I hate when that happens, especially when you have something else pictured."
20726,Are you able to send it back?
20727,I can't imagine. How old is he?
20728,"Yeah, that's a hard age to separate from a child. They don't really understand. I have to leave my 16 year old sometimes and he jumps for joy."
20729,That is a nice surprise! Do you usually work every weekend?
20730,I am glad you got this one off!
20731,yea they grow up way too fast
20732,That sounds awesome! What band?
20733,They sound rock metal. Hope you have a great time!
20734,ah that sucks! what city?
20735,dang in the middle of no where
20736,uh oh.. late trip to the local walmart to get more!
20737,sounds like a plan
20738,Was there too much work?
20739,Did you get any help?
20740,how was it? get smashed?
20741,crap that sucks! did you have fun?
20742,Oh that's cool!  Who are you going to see?
20743,Hey I saw Breaking Benjamin a couple years ago at an unplugged concert in Nashville!  You're gonna have some fun!!
20744,"Eww, thats gross! Poor kid needs to learn some manners!"
20745,"I bet, I would have had to look away!"
20746,I think everyone gets nervous. You'll be fine!
20747,"It must be an exciting time, too."
20748,That is annoying. Do they say anything when you answer?
20749,I don't blame you!
20750,whats his name?
20751,"my wife loves that name, we have a son that will be 2 in december. if we have another one his name will be knox"
20752,Who are you going to see?
20753,That will be a fun concert!
20754,It's nice to hear someone thinking about others. Many people who luck out don't care what happens to others or are grateful for their lot in life.
20755,Sounds like you have a great family.
20756,Tell me about it. It's over 100 almost every day here and it's so humid it makes the air feel sticky!
20757,Central Louisiana. Hot and gross out here! Imagine a steaming swamp.
20758,i love Mexican food! salsa is the best
20759,yeah thats true! with a margarita
20760,"Oh man, your dad sounds awesome."
20761,Does he know that?
20762,Yeah? That's a good thing! What's going on in your life right now?
20763,That's awesome! I very happy for you. I hope you have many good years to come as well.
20764,"Oh no, I am sorry to hear that."
20765,I hope you can find some comfort during this time!
20766,Not many people are thankful for their family. I am glad you are.
20767,"That is good to hear, it sounds like you are a very loyal employee."
20768,"If you find a place that cares for their people, stay with them!"
20769,You must be excited! Will it go on the whole day?
20770,That's still awesome. Have a great time!
20771,what are you playing?
20772,wow that is impressive!!
20773,Sometimes that is good and sometimes it is bad. Depends on how bad you need the money. I hope it was a good thing for you.
20774,"Yeah, I had forgot it was Friday. I always enjoyed getting off early then."
20775,good luck! need something bigger?
20776,yea i feel your pain! we will be buying a bigger home also
20777,"That sounds fun, what concert?"

20794,"Hey, the party was probably worth it."
20795,That's dope. Who's playing?

20797,"that always stinks, i hate being short handed "
20798,"man that will be great, working long shifts aint fun"
20799,Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently?
20800,That is bad. Do you live in a place with high humidity?
20801,you ever cut it yourself ? or is it too big of a yard?
20802,yea sometimes its relaxing to be out there cutting the grass by yourself 
20803,"That's awful, I hope no one in your family was hurt."
20804,"Luckily. In bad situations like that, it is always best to remind ourselves that things could have been a lot worse for ourselves."
20805,That sounds like a lot of fun! Who are you going to see?
20806,Awesome! They play some good music!
20807,whoa thats shocking! how old is she?
20808,holy smokes thats a huge gap!
20809,"we always do that, its so convenient "
20810,no way its awesome!
20811,You're gonna be tired the next day.
20812,Too bad it's on a Sunday.
20813,"That's great, how long was it on for?"
20814,That is a pretty long time to have your leg wrapped up. How'd you injure it?
20815,"Yea. After all that, I think it's definitely time for you to relax and have fun!"
20816,You should be proud of yourself really.
20817,Hey that's a good deal!  Where was this?
20818,Yeah that sounds sooooo good right now!  I may need to go to chinese tonight!!
20819,Oh no. Can you go back?
20820,I'm sure you'll do fine if you practice enough!
20821,"Understandably so, I get nervous during presentations too. Take some deep breaths and you'll pull through!"
20822,Is that a play or music band?
20823,"that is the worst, i hate when people cant park"
20824,"i know the feeling, there are a ton of people like that too"
20825,that sounds cool.. how long has he been competing ?
20826,It's lovely! did you miss him?
20827,Take care of him!
20828,"Yeah, me too! Is your friend working abroad too?"
20829,Okay interesting. Well I would guess that she is probably studying right no!
20830,Everyone has their preference.
20831,Aw no luck with the ladies?
20832,whats tomorrow night?
20833,"awesome i love mma, what fighter you like?"
20834,Aww that's good for him though!  Who was the band?
20835,That's an awesome band.  So jealous of him!!!  Wish we could've ALL went!
20836,Is it the traffic or driving that gives you anxiety?
20837,Oh gosh. That's not safe at all. 
20838,"thats awesome , one day i want to make it to retirement im happy to hear people work this long, in my area young people refuse to work all they do is party and live off there familys money"
20839,"thanks , and once again thank you for your service in any field contributing to society "
20840,Why were you scared to walk home?
20841,"That is pretty terrifying, but I'm happy to see that you made it through in one piece."
20842,"Wow, that sounds like fun! She's so beautiful."
20843,Yes she does. She's very talented. I'd love to see her live.
20844,That is so scary! People are so desperate these days.
20845,"I would have been, too. I am glad you are okay!"
20846,"Is that a football team?  I'm sorry, I'm not a sports fan.  Are they your favorite team?"
20847,I hope they perform well this year then!  It's always nice to have a winning team.
20848,its sad once you get older those things dissapear
20849,dirty 30 parties are the best!
20850,What got in the way of your plans?
20851,"That's such a shame, I'm sorry to hear that."
20852,Oh no! Did anyone help you?
20853,Yeah I can imagine
20854,That is horrible. Do you live in a city or rural areas?
20855,It is unbelievable to meet these wild animals in a city. You should definitely call them
20856,bosses can be such aholes!
20857,yep if it deserves to be yelled at thats one thing
20858,"I'm a Reds fan myself........I know the Braves have a good chance of winning their division and I agree, probably not made for a deep playoff ren."
20859,Yeah....I have no complaints with him.....his salary is too big for the franchise but that ain't his fault.
20860,You must have felt very lonely.
20861,At least you were productive!
20862,what did he tell you ? did he like them as well
20863,"when my brother loves the things i love , it makes me feel good like we are bonding "
20864,thats a shame! did he get any of it back?
20865,"thats good, my house was also broken in to"
20866,"Hey, It's never too late. Unless you can't exercise at all there is always a way to start. "
20867,"Don't worry about the calories for now. Just start moving more, and maybe join an exercise class. You'll start to enjoy it, and before you know it the weight will just start dropping off!"
20868,It's not good to be stuck alone. I'm sure you can make friends with someone there!
20869,"Take it from me, you've got to work on getting over that shyness before it's too ingrained in you! I'm still pretty introverted but I enjoy meeting new people now and it helps with my emotional state a ton."
20870,Oh no!  How are you handling the disappointment?
20871,That's a great attitude to have about it.  But I understand that it still stings a bit.  
20872,That is a big moment. Are you a little sad?
20873,"I would be a mess, my son is about to turn two and I am sad about that. Time goes by so fast."
20874,what were you going to get?
20875,i have one and it is awesome
20876,Yeah? How much of a chance do you think they have?
20877,That would be awesome! I hope they do too!
20878,"Who knows, they always choke."
20879,Maybe this year will be their year.
20880,that stinks! hopefully you will get one soon
20881,maybe itll all work out for you!
20882,lol.  Put some headphones on yourself and tune him out!
20883,Maybe you could play your own video games?
20884,Oh.  Maybe watch some cool youtube vids?
20885,"That's awesome! Mine has been just fine, not bad"
20886,I hope it continues!
20887,Do you even have a dog?
20888,That's so disgusting. You should catch them one day and drag them to the police station.
20889,oh nice! she will be in my town this weekend
20890,"i have hear so as well, i love concerts"
20891,"Yeah, they seem to be doing good this year."
20892,"Hopefully so, maybe they can make a good run this year."
20893,that is so awesome! are you going to pass it down to a family member
20894,that would be so nice to have!
20895,Do you live in Atlanta?  I haven't been to the new stadium yet and I really would like to - have you?
20896,Well hello neighbor!  I'm going to have to get down there one day - I remember way back when they won the World Series I think in 1991 maybe?  It was so exciting!
20897,You think so?   
20898,Awesome!  I'll have to check them out this year.  I'm a cowboys fan LOL
20899,what did you get?
20900,extra money is always great!

20902,Good. He is fast growing child! 
20903,What kind are you looking to get?
20904,"Awesome, are you adopting?"
20905,I am glad you are getting to leave. I hope you find somewhere safe. 
20906,That sounds like a plan.
20907,"that is awesome i would feel the same way , i want to be a father one day i am really happy for you"
20908,"you made my day , hope everything goes well "
20909,lol dude is living the life
20910,lol he has no cares which is always good
20911,That's great! What kind of show?
20912,Oh sweet! I'd love to go to one of their shows myself. I hope you have a great time.
20913,"Good, credit and debt are bad things."
20914,"What you are saying is true. Me too, I hate paying fpr interests."
20915,Take the knife and destroy it the next time it lands. That way they will learn a valuable lesson
20916,Kids can be annoying and such outcomes can teach them on how to properly behave
20917,Hey that's amazing!!  What did you major in?
20918,That's pretty cool!   I'm so glad for you!  I bet that was a lot of paper writing :D
20919,What show?
20920,"That sounds fun, those are always exciting."
20921,oh no what does she do?
20922,"thats sad, i hate to hear that"
20923,Are they doing good so far?
20924,That's awesome!  I hope they win it all !  They really are a great team.
20925,Oh no! Did they steal a lot?
20926,I bet! Did they damage anything?
20927,That is nice. How long have you been married?
20928,are you confident you will pass?
20929,great! i hope that you do!
20930,"I don't blame you, that is so scary! I am glad you are okay."
20931,"I hope they do, too. That is a dangerous person."
20932,That's really awesome. Your friends sound really great!
20933,Make sure you do something good for them in return!
20934,I bet it was nice to have extra help.
20935,Your sister sounds pretty awesome
20936,Oh no!  I know how violated that can make you feel - did they ever get caught?
20937,I can understand that!  Otherwise you are just wondering all the time who it is and if they will come back.  I hope you were able to get some security systems in place to help feel more at ease.
20938,Yeah the new places are always really busy when they first open too!
20939,Yeah same here
20940,where you going ?
20941,"nice , i have a friend who lives in florida hope you all enjoy it there"
20942,"I know, right. I miss seeing the phone booths everywhere. "
20943,Wow! I haven't thought about them in years. I can't remember the last time I saw one. 
20944,My daughter is thinking about that career track.  Is it hard though when an animal doesn't make it?
20945,"That would be the only thing that would keep me from it.  I admire those that care for our animals, so thanks to you for being you."
20946,That sounds like fun. How do you feel about it?
20947,what beach are you going to?
20948,i was born in savannah!
20949,I don't know much about baseball but I went to a Braves game a few weeks ago and it was fun
20950,Yes it is! We walked all around it
20951,"that is scary to me, i hate bikes"
20952,i agree they have regard for anyone else
20953,Why are you saying like this?
20954,indeed they are so good
20955,Holy cow that's amazing!!  Do you think you'll like this new job?
20956,That's really great!  I'm happy for you!  Knockem dead!
20957,Did you guys have a nice celebration?
20958,I love catfish! I'm glad you were able to enjoy a nice celebration with your mom.
20959,"Oh, that is the best. It's so nice to have a great friend. "
20960,I can see that. But she loves you for you and not for what you can afford. 
20961,I am the same lol I walk fast. Too fast sometimes
20962,LOL you get there faster
20963,How interesting
20964,Don't worry though. He will be home soon!
20965,That's wonderful that you are looking out for them like that.
20966,Awesome! I'm sure they will all do their best!
20967,Those don't sound like friends. I'd be extremely pissed off!
20968,"Yeah, don't let them lie to you. I don't know them, obviously, but that sounds like an excuse to me too."
20969,What were they looking for?
20970,I can't imagine how anxious that must have made you. I am glad it turned out to be benign. 
20971,"I'm sorry to hear that. That's a pretty common response to break ups. A lot of people go through it, so you're not alone! I hope you pull through soon."
20972,That's great to hear! I'm sure you'll find someone better soon.
20973,"hell no it does not , these people out here stealing that is exactly why im afraid of buying from e bay , a lot of bad reviews "
20974,"i would be really upset too , i have received defective merchandise too and its upsetting , waiting for the product for 1 week and checking the mail every day , only to get it broken"
20975,Oh congratulations! That's wonderful news.
20976,I am very happy for you. I wish you all the best!
20977,Yum I love buffets!
20978,"Yes, so many options"
20979,That is such a bummer have you spoken to him about this issue?
20980,That may be a issue I mean you want to trust\t your significant other but as women we know the changes and signs trust me.
20981,Oh that is great! Were you High School sweethearts?
20982,That is a great accomplishment since most marriages don't last very long. Congrats! 
20983,Oh. I love red hairs. I have always admired their unique genetic characteristic that sets apart from others
20984,"You know what, i have always secretly wanted to date red hair as a partner and I hope I will one day"
20985,Oh no!  Have you spoken to her at all since she left?
20986,That is so sad to hear!  Perhaps after she cools down a bit ya'll will be able to work it out.
20987,Yes it is. It's like you turn around and 10 years has gone by. 
20988,Wouldn't that be great. Think of all the changes we could make. 
20989,That's incredible! You must feel on top of the world!
20990,"I'm sure all the hard work and effort you put in to it really shows. I am trying to get in shape myself, and your story is inspiring!"
20991,I
20992,I'm so sorry to hear that do you try andspend a lot of time with her so she doesn't feel that way?
20993,That is great to hear now she has to build even more memories with you and your family so the loosing of your dad can get better for her.
20994,What's happening next month?!
20995,"Oh, wow! That's awesome. What beach are you going to?"
20996,Uh oh!!!  Better go investigate!
20997,Yeah that would suck.  You should throw some peanuts or corn up there.
20998,haha do it!  Not like you'll be sleeping tonight anyway!
20999,haha YES!  Sounds like a fun Friday night :D
21000,Oh no! Maybe you can plan to enjoy a picnic the following weekend.
21001,Sorry to hear that. Hope the weather is better next time!
21002,Oh that's cool! What kind of concert is it?
21003,Oh that's a big one! That should be an amazing show!
21004,Oh no! I hope it wasn't something that caused you real distress. 
21005,OMG! Bless your heart. I hope they feel guilty now knowing what they did to you. 
21006,Nothing like mail to brighten up your day! What was it?
21007,What a great gift! I have always wanted a Polaroid instant camera!
21008,Did he arrive back early?
21009,I bet you were extremely happy. A year without seeing a parent can be a very lonely feeling.
21010,That is so sad. I am sorry. Losing a pet is so hard. They are family.
21011,I know the feeling. The thought of replacing them seems impossible. Only time will tell if you are ever ready for another.
21012,That is so awesome and a great accomplishment do you plan to write more in the future? 
21013,Science was never my strongest but I admire those who love it because they are super smart I hope your next article makes it into a even bigger news article. 
21014,Yikes! You got one of the bad ones. They sure makes things hard. 
21015,Maybe he needs to break away from her a bit. Maybe then she will mind her own business. 
21016,That's awesome! Will it be your first time?
21017,"Nice, it's always fun even if you've been before."
21018,ugh I hate when that happens... when I worked in retail my boss always called me
21019,I actually liked retail but the customers and the schedule sucks lol
21020,Did you?  How did that work out?
21021,Oh no :(   I'm so sorry.   There's always adoption!
21022,OO are you going to the beach soon?
21023,"That should be so much fun, seeing his face when he first puts his feet in the water will be amazing!"
21024,"Wow, that is awesome! How long does that take?"
21025,That is really great! Your fitness and health are very important to take care of.
21026,what you planning on giving her ?
21027,"shes gonna be very happy , i would do the same for my mom"
21028,"No, I don't. What are the teams playing?"
21029,Nice. I didn't know about it.
21030,"Well, you should call 911. He might be dangerous anytime for the people in the surroundings"
21031,you ought to be careful
21032,Glad to hear you found it I know your heart was racing to find it especially if it was your favorite. 
21033,Have to be much more careful next time maybe get a box to put it in. 
21034,Oh no. I hope they will be able to find out soon what is causing them. 
21035,Bless your heart. I hope they find out and it's something they can treat it easily. 
21036,That's nice. It's good to be supportive
21037,That creates a great work environment
21038,"Awe, how cute! That is such a blessed moment."
21039,That's really cool to see their development and their growth.
21040,"What could you have found in that dark, dusty place?"
21041,Wow! Great find! I bet you was super happy.
21042,That sounds like a blast. Wish I could be there! 
21043,Sorry to hear that how did things turn out did you two make it work or going through the process now? 
21044,He has to be happy if he still there marriage is important and he has to be open in communication with you instead of pulling the divorce card. 
21045,what was it ? 
21046,"lol , we have possums down here , they get in the attic all the time too "
21047,That's what I like to hear. What do you do for a living?
21048,"Ah, the good ole side hustle. I like that. You should check out ""Side Hustle"" by Chris Guillebeau. I'm looking to start something myself. "
21049,"That was nice, did you ever get the moneyback?"
21050,How long ago did you lend them this money?
21051,"ah, thats being a good brother. Is your brother alright now?"
21052,good to hear that!!

21055,That sounds like fun! Where did you guys end up going?
21056,That's awesome! I can't wait to take my daughters to disney
21057,"every time a loved one dies its never good news , even if its a pet "
21058,"i love dogs , they just want someones attention , they are loyal till the end"
21059,"Whoa, that is really impressive! How much do you bench now?"
21060,It's cool to always remember those milestones. Helps to keep us motivated.
21061,oh! that's really fabulous
21062,"why, what is the reason ?"
21063,"Oh no, that is heartbreaking.  How is she and her mother holding up?"
21064,I can't even imagine.  I hope she has some great men in her life that can help to be that father figure for her.
21065,That sounds very nostalgic. How old is she now? 
21066,"It is indeed. I wish i could back to my childhood times. No hassle, no stress of paying bills. Adulthood is really difficult"
21067,"Yeah, i feel some are just picky on what job they want to have"
21068,"i have to stay late at work all the time , im sorry to hear that "
21069,yes it does lol
21070,I'm sorry - what exam are you talking about?  Did you take an exam?
21071,Do you think you did well on it?
21072,"lol, sounds like a cool type of work"
21073,what?
21074,oh why is that?
21075,"oh it sounds fun. You should try it once. You will enjoy it. You will be scared for the first time, but you will be okay"
21076,Hey that's awesome!  Where are you going for vacation??
21077,Oh I'm so jealous!  I bet that place is beautiful!!
21078,Maybe you can park a bicycle or skateboard there.
21079,Dang! Tell your friend to go find a new spot!
21080,Oh wow! That is great. Did she have a good day?
21081,I don't blame you. It's so sad to know that you have to leave them there. 
21082,"thats good , was it a 1.00 scratch off ?"
21083,"i would be happy too , but i would probably buy 20 tickets after and lose in every single one with my luck"
21084,YEs because they never want to hang out unless they bring their partner lol
21085,I've been in that situation many times lol
21086,That's awesome! I hope you do great.
21087,Good luck!!
21088,I bet you had some good times when she was a baby!  How old is she now?
21089,haha I bet she's a doll!  Cherish these moments!
21090,"I am sorry, maybe you can hang out with some friends"
21091,I hope you feel better!
21092,Aww!  Why?
21093,Oh no!!! Is she okay?
21094,It's funny! 
21095,"Wow! That is gross, did you kill it?"
21096,I hope you lit it on fire!
21097,Such things are very rare if you use services from reputable delivering companies. What carrier did you use for your delivery?
21098,It is very unusual. UPS is very competitive company and they should have resolved the issue quickly
21099,Oh no! Did you get a police report and exchange information?
21100,It's always good to exchange the information to make sure that they follow up about that. Hope your car gets fixed soon.
21101,That is definitely something to celebrate!
21102,Do you have big plans?
21103,"Oh no, that's a horrible feeling"
21104,Uh oh! Maybe time to move on
21105,What is going to happen in September?
21106,Wow! I bet he will love that. 
21107,That is great that you are going to take him. He will always remember it. 
21108,That is great news. What job was it for?
21109,When will you know if you got the job?
21110,Good luckk!!
21111,Yes dont give upQ! I bet you'll find something good
21112,oh i know what you mean
21113,thats very annoying
21114,"Whoa, were you in a hurry? Did something happen?"
21115,"Luckily nothing happened, but better to be safe while driving."
21116,"Well, that will be great! Where are y'all going?"
21117,"We just got back from there 2 weeks ago, we stayed at Miramar Beach. I'm sure it will be a lot of fun and relaxation!"
21118,Right. What is the purpose of going to movies if people talk there. Uninformed people everywhere
21119,You should confront them next time if it happens. They should be put in their place for improper social behavior
21120,Are you going to get it fixed?
21121,Will she give you any money for the repair?
21122,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. It's very hard to lose a loved one, I know from personal experience."
21123,"Yes, even though death is part of life, it's very hard. I hope things are better for you."
21124,"Awe shucks, what stopped you?"
21125,Well I do hope you get to have your hike soon! I'm sure if you keep putting in the work it will pay off eventually.
21126,"oh well, whats the show. i know for sure you would have enjoyed it again"
21127,nostalgic isnt it?
21128,That is terrible news. How did he die?
21129,I lost my friend to a heart attack. He was only 35.
21130,Oh really? I can imagine
21131,oh thats too bad but i bet you will do fine
21132,"Oh, well that doesn't sound good. But, maybe you have good reasons?"
21133,"Oh, well, in all honesty, it probably won't last if he's a bad guy anyway."
21134,"Oh no, how did that make you feel?"
21135,It happens. But next time you;ll be more aware
21136,Well that's very sweet of him! 
21137,I always love surprises like that. And a new laptop is a pretty big deal. Enjoy it!
21138,oh i didnt get a chance to see the game
21139,wow thats insane
21140,What did you do after they cut you off?
21141,Did you at least honk your horn?
21142,That sounds so annoying to deal with.
21143,"Without a doubt, most drivers are total morons."
21144,ah that bad!!. You need again to wait for ages!!
21145,When you see them again it will be worth a wait!!
21146,wow good for you man
21147,dang that is so awesome
21148,Did you make friends eventually?
21149,How did you get through it?
21150,I'm not sure I've ever used them. I think my earliest music media was cassettes.
21151,"That's cool. The history of them are as well, Sometimes, it's nice to use something from the past."
21152,That's awesome. How'd he do?
21153,Nice. I bet you were so proud.
21154,You definitely should cherish these moments.
21155,How did your sister react?
21156,How did that make you feel?
21157,"That's alright. She's family, so she will still love you. Just learn from this mistake. "
21158,"Oh wow, why?"
21159,"Damn, hopefully you're doing better now."
21160,What went wrong?
21161,Did you use Tinder again?
21162,"With Trump in the presidency, it won't end soon.You can bet on that"
21163,"You know nothing about politics, go watch soap operas"
21164,So you consider yourself total loser in life?
21165,It is pathetic and unacceptable. You should grow up and stop being so irresponsible
21166,Did it hurt?
21167,Did you go to the doctor?
21168,"yea thats fair, ive done the same thing"
21169,haha that might be too far
21170,that was my favorite game ever
21171,"same, it was awesome"
21172,That's pretty good reflexes on his part.
21173,So many of my friends have cracked phones so I guess mine are clumsier. 
21174,Same! That is why I never go outside and just be on my computer all day!
21175,You got this! Fake it until you make it!
21176,Maybe you shouldn't go then.
21177,Hopefully nothing bad will happen.
21178,"ah so sad for you, where did he/she moved?"
21179,"oh yeah, nice pace though but you will miss him a lot i guess!!"
21180,I imagine that was a big surprise! Did you ever mention to him?
21181,"Well, I can relate. My sister and I found some playboy magazines nosing around too!"
21182,I am sure there will be another chance.
21183,Maybe you should buy him lunch to make a peace offering.
21184,What happened? Is there anything specific that makes you feel that way?
21185,Then why don't you go shopping? Is it because you have financial difficulties?
21186,I somewhat disagree. It's been so hot I'll be happy to see the end of summer.
21187,That is a pretty good tradeoff.
21188,Is the phone working?
21189,Did he get dirty when he dove?
21190,oh that must be scary
21191,wow well good luck
21192,I would think they are now. Are they already closed down for the summer?
21193,"Oh, I see. Well, they are a lot of fun!"
21194,What makes you think that?
21195,That's pretty much the same reason that I don't want kids.
21196,I never use Tinder due to that reason.
21197,Have you ever tried any other apps?
21198,Yikes!  Did you study real hard for it?
21199,Aww.  I think you will do okay!
21200,"thats so cool, good for him"
21201,How come. I can't imagine weddings without the presence of parents. You should convince her to come
21202,But it is you who choose which girl to marry and which one not. You should try to explain it to her that old days are over
21203,Have you studied?
21204,"You will do fine, I know it."
21205,Sounds like a fun event. What all is there to it?
21206,"Yes, that would be quite fun! My children will not go to haunted house, no matter how much we try to bribe them lol"
21207,That's so great! Most people aren't.
21208,"I know some people that eat healthy, but still struggle with their weight. So, that's great you don't!"
21209,"Wow, so far I've just had a girlfriend for a week and got laid a few times."
21210,"True, though I just wish girls weren't so shallow sometimes."
21211,"That is good, you shouldn't even go on Tinder."
21212,That wasn't ever nice of her.
21213,Really?  I've always wanted to see them!  When did you go
21214,Awesome!  So glad they're still rocking after all these years!
21215,Where do you shop?
21216,Where is the trip to?
21217,"oh thats really cool, good luck"
21218,seems like a tough sport
21219,Did you apologize to them?
21220,"It ok, mistakes happen."
21221,You should go out and meet new people.
21222,Do you have friends now?
21223,yea i agree
21224,they are important to the ecosystem but i wish they would stay away from me
21225,When is the test?
21226,"That is good, you must of studied a long time."
21227,wow that must have been a huge moment for you
21228,well good for you
21229,Uh ohh!  Did you honk at them?
21230,Yeah.  I'd say so.  I can't stand bad drivers!
21231,oh man mustve brought back memories
21232,wow that sucks so bad
21233,You can at least phone them.
21234,You can go visit.
21235,Nice association. Do you have any memory attached to it?
21236,Do you visit her often?
21237,That's so wonderful! I had a very close relationship with my sister too. I always treasured it and loved her so much!
21238,"That's so great. My sister was mine too. She passed away several years ago, so never take him for granted and treasure every moment with him!"
21239,oh wow that sounds really tough
21240,well good luck with that
21241,"That is horrible news, so sorry."
21242,How did he die?
21243,oh you did? what was it about?
21244,dang thats a bit low
21245,Did you pull over to help?
21246,That was nice of you.
21247,What did they do to make you proud?
21248,That is good news. What kind of job?
21249,"Oh no, when did that happen?"
21250,How old are you? It's more rough when you're young.
21251,is there a chance you wont?
21252,hopefully you get it
21253,Why? Must be something fun and exciting going on?
21254,"Oh, well no doubt that will be fun! I like that it isn't fake, like wrestling."
21255,That is great you have friends.
21256,How often do you see them.
21257,thats so cool.
21258,"thats great, happy for you"
21259,"Same here, he must make so much money."
21260,I totally agree.
21261,Why was that?
21262,Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
21263,oof was it the cost?
21264,yikes thats quite a sum of money
21265,Did you call a tow truck? LOL.
21266,Did you ice your toe?
21267,"That's great! But, what is it?"
21268,"Oh, okay! Well, I love some Blackjack. I like Poker, but better at Blackjack. But, not on your level by any means! Good for you!"
21269,Oh that sucks!  Why did he/she make you work??
21270,Yeah I've worked for bosses like that in the past.  At least you get overtime?
21271,That's cool. Is he smart?
21272,What position does he play?
21273,Are they? Damn I can't believe I didn't hear.
21274,"Agreed, that would be badass."
21275,What was the name of the film?
21276,I love that movie.
21277,"Oh, well it happens sometimes and can't be helped. But, I understand why it would make you feel bad too!"
21278,"I'm sure it probably upset them, but maybe they realize it was for a reason. And I'm sure they've done the same thing."
21279,wow thats impressive
21280,Did anyone get hurt?
21281,Did you yell at the other person?
21282,wow thats so horrible
21283,hopefully well
21284,"Wow, that is pretty cool"
21285,And when did this happened?
21286,That's awesome!  College or high school?
21287,That's great to hear!  What is his major?
21288,"Yes, I have many great weeks."
21289,What happened to make it great?
21290,Did you not study for it?
21291,Hopefully you learned a lesson from this experience. If you want to do well you need to be prepared.
21292,That was nice of her!
21293,Make sure to tell her that!
21294,I could imagine. Were you two very close?
21295,"It's good to have that close bond with your siblings, though."
21296,What is the issue?
21297,Won't you still be able to see her?
21298,ah you used her. You should have filled. But however she will understand
21299,oh mom's will be mom. she will forgive you
21300,Do you like it?
21301,Which color is it?
21302,How many people entered?
21303,That isn't a lot of people but still a good job.
21304,"I don't think I know that band. But, I'm sure you will have lots of fun!"
21305,"Well there ya go, I didn't know. The Weeknd sounds like a band, more than just one person."
21306,Anything in particular?
21307,You need to catch up.
21308,Your high school yearbook?
21309,When do you think it will happen?
21310,You think so?  Do you have a plan for the end of the world?
21311,Oh? What made you so mad?
21312,Oh I hate that too. Just let me buy what I need to buy and leave.
21313,Did you manage to get it?
21314,As long as you keep the GPA to what you need though
21315,I am glad for you
21316,OMG...how gross. What did you do?
21317,LOL....I think that's when I would start crying.
21318,What's happening next week?
21319,Really! They are so much fun
21320,DEfinitely. It's an adrenalin rush
21321,Sticks and stones..
21322,Hey that's great!  That makes for an awesome day.  It's not quite daylight here yet.
21323,Yeah.  It's usuallty around 0600 here when it gets light.  It's only 3 here now though
21324,Yeah I'm sure it will.  Enjoy your beautiful day!
21325,Thank you so much :D
21326,That is kinda sad
21327,Did you talked to her after?
21328,"Ew, that's pretty gross since the floor is probably dirty as hell."
21329,Especially in public when people can see you do it.
21330,"LOL, well, they must have been very good then. We all overindulge at times, so don't feel too bad."
21331,"Well, it can be hard to resist sometimes. But, maybe just eat a bit healthier for a few days, and it'll make up for it."
21332,OH yeah! It's so painful. Did you do that today?
21333,Things will get better from here on out
21334,They call that Post traumatic Stress Disorder
21335,I think you should
21336,I'm sure you're gonna nail it!   What is the job?
21337,Have you worked in one before?
21338,Cool.  So you have some good experience.  I'd say this new job is yours!  Good luck!
21339,You're welcome my friend.   It's their loss if they don't hire you!
21340,Every single one? That's messed up.
21341,I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
21342,"Wow, that is a good friend"
21343,"Nice, did you passed the test?"
21344,That situation can make you apprehensive. What would be making him upset?
21345,I think that your Dad will be more concerned about you being injured than scolding you. Go home.
21346,Oh thats bad. you should have really given them your piece of mind. Driving skills of people going down
21347,yeah that's good really
21348,Cool - how did it go?
21349,Good. Have you arranged to meet again?
21350,Brilliant. It's like having a new friend.
21351,Was it that bad?
21352,And why was that?
21353,Was it good news?
21354,That's has to be a relief. Hopefully he won't fall off the wagon. With alcoholism it's one day at a time.
21355,"That's the worst, especially when you see employees doing nothing."
21356,Well thankfully it's over now.
21357,Do you think you could overcome it?
21358,I cheer for you to make it
21359,Well it would have been nostalgic!!. You would have enjoyed for sure
21360,old is gold saying is so true. All our memories comes up.
21361,Did you passed the test?
21362,"Oh, I'm so sorry, can yo retake the test?"
21363,That's nice of him! How long did it take?
21364,Not bad at all!
21365,That's great. How old is she?
21366,Lol. Do you see a lot of her?
21367,LOL....Been there and done that. Don't feel guilty. What's done is done.
21368,No need beating yourself up something you can't change. Got another pack?
21369,Why does he need surgery then?
21370,I hope it does too!
21371,oh feel sorry for you. I just hope you will get it next time
21372,you will get it don't you worry about it
21373,When is the interview?
21374,I hope you get the job
21375,What is the job about?
21376,"Oh, very good, I work with a charity too"
21377,Thats terrible. Some people are scumbags.
21378,Did you contact the police?
21379,Sounds like a perfect day.
21380,"Glad to hear it, I hope I have a day like that soon."
21381,Do you know how to do it correctly now though?
21382,Well - you live and learn.
21383,"Oh, I would've freaked out"
21384,"Sounds like a safer option, any idea on how it got in?"
21385,Perhaps it would be wise to close them at night
21386,Perhaps then put something so they cannot get in
21387,Well done! What kind of car did you get?
21388,Wow. Are you happy with it?
21389,I wish I was patient enough to save like that
21390,I'm impressed. You should be proud of yourself.
21391,That's great. How old is he now?
21392,I'm pleased for him. Hopefully he'll be the next Usain Bolt.
21393,"Chain of command do work. We can't help it, I feel the same"
21394,Indeed it ought to be
21395,What kind of dead bodies?
21396,I understand your feelings.
21397,If they don't want to have anything to do with you because you are poor then they are pretty shallow and dispicable. I've still got the pigs if you want to get rid of them.
21398,Why did it make you upset?
21399,Wow he must be pretty loaded.
21400,"I've never even owned a car, never mind an Audi!"
21401,"It does, any recent event that made you feel like that?"
21402,"Oh, I am happy for you"
21403,"Awesome, congrats was this during a college course?"
21404,Was is a general eduaction class or one towards your major?
21405,Well good luck for you. you don't like your old one?
21406,"i am sure, you will get it. I pray for you"
21407,No. Why not?
21408,That's important. Maybe you're right to stick with it there.
21409,"Oh wow, that sounds like something I wouldn't do"
21410,Why was he doing it
21411,Other countries sure are weird
21412,Really? What game did you get?
21413,Is it good?
21414,Yeah - feels better when you've paid for it yourself.
21415,So she should be. WEll done.
21416,Since when?
21417,Is it your favorite necklace?
21418,What car did you get?
21419,Good. Well done. When do you find out?
21420,Oh what kind of pizza?
21421,That sounds so good!
21422,I hope you are prepared
21423,"Everything will go fine, all you have to do is be yourself"
21424,Really? Thats disgusting
21425,Me neither. I spoke to someone who had seen a show about a guy eating a live squid. Yuck!
21426,Some of them
21427,You will be just fine.
21428,that sucks!! you should have been really annoyed with the delivery boy!
21429,Yeah!! you should refused to take the pizza and returned it
21430,You can only do your best in an unexpected situation.
21431,"It's like Larry Gelwix says ""What's Important Now?"" - what is the best course of action right this second to improve performance. It's inspiring."
21432,Was it from someone you knew?
21433,What made him not speak well in your eyes?
21434,That seems like he needs to be let go then.
21435,"Oh, that's awful to hear, how did yo react?"
21436,"Oh, that sounds like an awful lie, what did you do after?"
21437,Were they trying to steal from your car?
21438,"I would be too, so that's understandable."
21439,"Oh, did you go?"
21440,Then all is well.
21441,Is it for a hourly wage job or salary?
21442,"Was it in a field that you wanted to be in, or just because you needed a job?"
21443,Once or twice. What happened to make you ask?
21444,That's terrible - recently?
21445,Is it an absolute mess inside?
21446,Such a shame. 
21447,That is really impressive.
21448,I could use some burgers myself right now.
21449,"That is terrible, my friend."
21450,I feel so bad for you.
21451,"Oh, that is awful, did it sting you?"
21452,"Oh, I'm glad, where was it?"
21453,That's quiet funny though
21454,Yeah - what did she do?
21455,Really? Was it good? I've never eaten there.
21456,Good. What did you have?
21457,"Oh, what did you get?"
21458,That sounds really cool.
21459,Did you lose weight?
21460,Oh damn! How long ago was that?
21461,Hopefully that isn't too big an issue.
21462,Oh no. Will you get it back OK?
21463,It's frustrating when that sort of thing happens
21464,Things will get better.
21465,Do you cheer for a specific team or just watch the matches?
21466,"Oh, that's pretty cool, are they good?"
21467,Really? Did they find out?
21468,Did you not feel that you should admit it? How did you accidentally eat it anyway?
21469,You are a terrible person. If someone ate my cake I'd be heartbroken!
21470,Buy him another cake. 
21471,I guess no. Have you?
21472,Awful. It doesn't happen to anyone. 
21473,For music?
21474,How many counties are you planning on vistiing?
21475,That is a bad cat.
21476,Did you clean it up?
21477,homeless people can be good sometimes but sometimes its just annoying
21478,thats fair
21479,Arrgg - so annoying. 
21480,Did you shout at him?
21481,a bit late for that
21482,Really? What was the address? No - only joking. 
21483,Maybe.
21484,Oh yeah? What was on it?
21485,Ooo that's nice of them!
21486,That is the worst thing ever.
21487,I hope things get better.
21488,"Oh man, that's a bummer, how did that happened?"
21489,Was she honest about it or did you find out the hard way?
21490,Me too. Who do you support?
21491,I hope they do well for you
21492,Perhaps some pigs helped you out with that?
21493,You are so brilliant.
21494,"oh wow thats awesome, i did the same last month it was nice"
21495,"Oh wow thats crazy, super cool tho"
21496,awesome! i will pray go for your work to be assigned to you
21497,ok dude it was too late i have to go home else my mom will scold me
21498,Why do you think about it then?
21499,That seems weird to me
21500,That's annoying. Why is she doing that?
21501,"Oof that isn't good, sorry to hear man."
21502,Really? It's a nice car to drive.
21503,Me too! Must have cost a lot.
21504,That sounds so amazing!
21505,Really? Cool. What did you do?
21506,Ahh - so they were like a free gift?
21507,It's pity. But why are you alone?
21508,that was so mean
21509,wow that sucks
21510,"i can imagine, my condolences "
21511,I'm glad you understand your actions.
21512,"Oh, that's amazing news"
21513,Was it a big promotion?
21514,well have fun with that
21515,"I understand, you will miss home but also excited for college."
21516,"I agree, but you will get to see them again when you come back!"
21517,"Oh that makes sense, aren't academics huge in asian culture?"
21518,Good to hear that he is performing so well.
21519,sounds shameful yet amazing
21520,"Thats fair enough, took many biscuits bad for the health"
21521,Really? Like a mugger?
21522,"Good of you, you are a nice person."
21523,So looks like you won't be getting your money back any time soon!
21524,Have you had it for long?
21525,Wow! That's a classic. Why do you need to sell it?
21526,yea i would be sad
21527,"Wow, that's hardcore, are you alright?"
21528,"I would've thought the same, is your house ok?"
21529,Oh no! Was it OK?
21530,It's nasty. Did you have to clean it up or did someone else?
21531,wow sounds great
21532,yea i can imagine
21533,I know right! Go Tottenham!
21534,This is will be a great season!
21535,you must have been annoyed!!
21536,ah thats so bad of your neighbors!!
21537,"Oh my, how did you manage to get out of that situation? Did you hitch a ride?"
21538,Phew! Good have ended a lot worse if that gas station wasn't there.
21539,That's cool of them! How was it?
21540,Oh that's awkward haha.
21541,"Oh, not good, how did that happened?"
21542,"I could imagine it was, did someone got hurt?"
21543,Were they being rude to you?
21544,Ugh! She was probably doing it on purpose to annoy you!
21545,yea it feels so bad
21546,"wow that really sucks, im sure you will bounce back"
21547,Is she sick or was it was one time thing?
21548,Was it a new rug
21549,Scumbag! How can we find out who?
21550,There must be some way. Let's look at the suspects.
21551,Why are you so lonely?
21552,"Oh, you and your silly pigs."
21553,That is so great of you.
21554,I am very happy for you.
21555,sounds scary
21556,good luck with that then
21557,Why you say that?
21558,"That is such a shame to hear, you could try having an imaginary friend"
21559,He sounds like a bad influence
21560,"Good, don't get rid of the only friend you have"
21561,Maybe you've still got time to do some prep.
21562,Is tehre anyone you could ask to help you prepare?
21563,well the odds are quite bad but that still sucks
21564,"Nice, have you heard back yet?"
21565,Hopefully you will get it if you prepared well!
21566,That must be such an amazing feeling!
21567,"Well I'm really happy for you, man."
21568,Good thing is you had an alternative. How did your date go?
21569,I hope you can find a way to convince her if you really like or love her
21570,"Oh, how did that go?"
21571,That is an interesting meeting.
21572,You too? One of mine died from food poisoning recently. What are you going to do?
21573,"You know what they say, don't you? ""You can always buy a new pig - just don't, under any circumstances, involve the cops"""
21574,Did you have notecards?
21575,Was it about a proposal?
21576,"I think I have, it made me feel bad. have you?"
21577,Do you feel bad about it now? I think you do but sometimes we have to do hard things in life.
21578,"Oh, did you get it?"
21579,I wish you all the best.
21580,How did that go then?
21581,I'd hope so too!
21582,i bet it did
21583,Yuck. I suppose some people need to do that to survive though
21584,Really? Did you say anything to them?
21585,What did they say?
21586,"Oh, so scary, what was it?"
21587,"Oh, sounds like you should replace it"
21588,"Oh my, that is so disgusting. Why would you watch something like that?"
21589,"Oh I see, I don't think I would be able to eat something like that!"
21590,Yeah - how old were you?
21591,What game did you have?
21592,Dang that's annoying.  Is there anyway you can still get a similar job?
21593,Yeah that's understandable.
21594,oh really?
21595,yea nostalgia is a real kicker
21596,That's really strange of them haha.
21597,Yeah - what will you be studying?
21598,Ahh - when you are home do you have to share?
21599,wow thats quite rude of them
21600,Aw did you feel lonely? I was like that too but I found friends in my second year.
21601,"Don't worry, hit the gym and join student clubs."
21602,That should be a crime!
21603,"I would be too, it must have tasted disgusting! What a waste of nachos. "
21604,What did the voice say?
21605,I thought the voice was telling you to feed the pigs again.
21606,oh really? that makes me feel rubbish too
21607,def worth it
21608,Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you know him well?
21609,Yeah - it can be upsetting
21610,maybe buy one then? gotteeem
21611,5 likes in the chat?
21612,That's pretty bizarre.
21613,Whopped in the beak by that glass.
21614,"You must have felt hopeful, where did you apply?"
21615,"I see, I think you will get the job"
21616,Really - recently? The temperature there can get REALLY high can't it?
21617,What kind of treasure?
21618,oh that sounds quite nice
21619,oh yea?
21620,What cartoon was it?
21621,Oh those were the good old days.
21622,seems worth it tho
21623,That's annoying
21624,I would be too so that's fair.
21625,Sounds pretty unfun to me
21626,Glad to hear that the studying paid off
21627,yea i know how that feels
21628,yea it feels extra bad
21629,"wow thats awesome, must feel nice"
21630,hopefully i also reach that point
21631,Do you feel bad about it? You should be more careful next time.
21632,"As you should bee. but its okay, we are all human and make human mistakes some times."
21633,dang thats impressive
21634,nice job
21635,Man that's the worst.
21636,Feels so good man
21637,He must be a good player!
21638,You must be a great parent!
21639,"Oh no, you must have been very scared. "
21640,Did you get away? Why was the dog chasing you in the first place?
21641,Why don't they eat lunch with you?
21642,That does not sounds good! Are you proud of him for standing up?
21643,I am glad for him. Bullies should not be allowed to behave badly towards others.
21644,"That's good, how old is your son?"
21645,Oh he is quite a grown man. I bet you wanted to catch up on old time growing up with him
21646,Do you have certain expectations for your son?
21647,That's something for which to be proud!  Why don't you feel good about it?
21648,Oh that sucks.  What is it that she does?
21649,They're professional naggers.  It's just what they do.
21650,"That awesome, must have been a proud moment for you both."
21651,That sucks. Is there no way of getting them out?
21652,foids are trash ree
21653,get me some dat respect
21654,That's good to hear that his hard work paid off
21655,"True, a month is not too long."
21656,oof those memories can hurt
21657,Nice! I hope you feel happy for him and not jealous! 
21658,"Yup, hard work tends to do that."
21659,That is so terrible.
21660,I hope he learns his lesson.
21661,So sorry to hear that. You must feel sad.
21662,Time will heal. Remember you dog for all the good memories. 
21663,"Congratulations, thats great news. How did you propose?"
21664,"Yeah man, it would have sucked if she said no."
21665,Why does she get you angry?
21666,I hope things get better you two.
21667,"Oh no, that must have been awkward "
21668,Does he know that that was the job you wanted?
21669,i am the same
21670,Sounds like you had a bad experience. What happened in Washington?
21671,Oh goodness! How did you react?
21672,"Wow, it has served you well"
21673,Yes you do that buddy
21674,You must have prepared well in advance to not be nervous!
21675,Good for you! Hard work always pays off buddy.
21676,That's nice of her!  I bet you were shocked when you saw everybody!
21677,"That's awesome, it's nice to feel loved."
21678,"That's really nice to hear, I hope it goes well."
21679,Oh no that sounds really scary!
21680,Luckily you weren't hurt though!
21681,It must have been a very hard decision for you.
21682,"I hope so too, it will take hard work but its possible."
21683,i feel so worried about this its impossible to stay for 15days
21684,"oh, thank god you were escape you have to thank god for doing great things"
21685,oh yea same
21686,seems super cool
21687,I hope you are feeling better.
21688,yea i know that tilts me so hard
21689,yea i bet he is
21690,"That's good, think you're gonna get an A?"
21691,Yeah hopefully you do pretty well at least.
21692,I was as well. What was it that impressed you most?
21693,Definitely. Hopefully the next World Cup will surprise just as much.
21694,Why's that? Do you think people will assume you are stealing?
21695,That's terrible. I could see how that would stay with you.
21696,Wow that sounds like one tough cookie!
21697,Yeah that's nice but at some point you have to learn your own limits.
21698,"oh thats nice, it's a happy thing to expect a child"
21699,Congratulations buddy
21700,"That's not too nice, did you punish him?"
21701,Hopefully this was just a one time thing.
21702,I hate eating dinner by myself.  What happened that you ended up eating dinner alone?
21703,I dont like being alone much either.  What would cause you to have bad thought?  Were you scared?
21704,It's hard to hold back the truth sometimes.
21705,Sounds like a lot of hard work.
21706,That's not acceptable even if he is drunk.
21707,I hope you get to set him straight somehow.
21708,You must be very happy now.
21709,I hope you keep it forever.
21710,yea no problem
21711,"Eww, did you get angry with her?"
21712,I hope you didnt abandon her.
21713,I hate cats that throw up.
21714,I am sure your shoes can be cleaned.
21715,yea hopefully you find it
21716,I know. It seems like I've been up early every weekend for a while now. Really wish I could sleep in!
21717,"What can you do when your body refuses to cooperate, eh?"
21718,Why were you so down on yourself about failing?
21719,Thats not a great attitude as you at least must give a go. You only fail if you don't try.
21720,"To your partners, you mean?"
21721,You should find a way to be satisfied with just one person.
21722,That's a great gesture! Is this for your first child?
21723,Definitely. Congratulations and good luck!
21724,"Yeah, we all were at some point."
21725,thats disgusting
21726,i would be to
21727,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried to talk to a professional about that?
21728,That's terrible. I hope the situation sorts itself out.
21729,"That's intense, what for?"
21730,"That's awful, I hope she turns out alright."
21731,You should be confident. 
21732,I am proud of you!
21733,That's good! Keep it up. It's hard to follow routine sometimes
21734,It'll pay off in the end
21735,"Same here, though it is the summer for me."
21736,"I guess so, though I'm tired so I want to sleep."
21737,LOOOLLL I'm the same way I hate their lack of willpower!
21738,Yeah at what point would you not look yourself in the mirror and be disgusted?
21739,"I think people find a way to lie to themself, and convince themselves that it isn't that bad.  body dismorphia."
21740,"So sorry, that must be devastating for you. "
21741,How long does he have left?
21742,Why do you get embarrassed?
21743,I bet you are great at it!
21744,"Yuck thats disgusting, did you throw up?"
21745,Was he insane or was it a part of he's culture? 
21746,"yes! pizza is on of lifes simple joys,  what is your favorite kind of pizza?"
21747,"ohhh yes, NY style is thin crust right?"
21748,I am so proud of you!
21749,I wish you the most success!
21750,"Yes! thats so fun, are you excited?"
21751,HAHAHAH she probably has no idea whats going on.
21752,No way! hahaha How did you find out?
21753,How embarrassing! lol
21754,omg it must have been quite an experience for you
21755,I hope he is alright now
21756,What do you mean? is everything okay?
21757,WOW! he never came back? thats hilarious and terrible.
21758,"Oh that's sad, are you going somewhere?"
21759,Oh yeah I remember that.  Pretty tough.
21760,Yes! me and my buddy go camping every year when it cools off.
21761,Yeah its been WAY to hot here lately to do anything.
21762,That sounds so scary!
21763,"I'm sorry, heights are the worst."
21764,OH NO! I would have been runnning up and down the halls yelling.
21765,Did you find out who did it and publicly spray ketchup all over them.
21766,"Sorry to hear that, thats disappointing when people pull out last minute."
21767,Did you let them know how you felt?
21768,Yes may very well be gay. Nothing wrong with that.  Ive had alot of gay friends.
21769,If you just stay confident and believe in yourself I know you can do it!
21770,Enjoy your time there!
21771,What did you eat? was it delicious.
21772,"Pizza is my lifeblood, along with beer."
21773,Were you excited or annoyed that the driver left them there?
21774,I know the feeling when you get the items you ordered. I think the anticipation os more exciting then actually having them.
21775,yes they are so soft and fun to cuddle to.
21776,"HA if only, If only people told you what they wanted like dogs do."
21777,That is the case for me too!
21778,"Yeah, I know that feeling."
21779,Wow thats a long time to wait for pizza.
21780,did you complain? Or at least ask for a discount.
21781,Was there anything in the pockets?
21782,haha the best would have been the girls phone number
21783,"HAHA yes all the time, and its even worse when they speak."
21784,"Ugh, yes like cant you tell from my body language I dont want to talk."
21785,I bet they don't follow it
21786,welll one day they will see you were right
21787,How old is she now? why do you miss her baby stage?
21788,"I see, she is probably all rambunctious now."
21789,That is some confidence.
21790,I am envious of you.
21791,Have you been studying? how do you feel about it?
21792,great! I just took all of my finals last week.
21793,That sounds somewhat weird.
21794,"Ok, I get it now."
21795,what movie? did you survive the night?
21796,OH my god! the ring scaed me half to death when it came out omg. IM scared thinking about it.
21797,I hope they are attractive.
21798,"Oh my, why on earth did you do that?"
21799,"As you should be, you hurt your girlfriend's feelings."
21800,Are you serious? I wish I could do that. Was he apart of a show
21801,Thats awesome- I wish I could do that like that impressive.
21802,"yes I have and its not fun at all, why would you have to break your wifes?"
21803,"Oh I see, why would that break her heart?"
21804,She sounds like a sweet woman.
21805,I am so envious of you.
21806,me too haha! now they re all painted as molestors.
21807,Thats right.  the world is so scary now a days.
21808,"That's a bit shocking, huh?"
21809,Wow I wonder what will happen now
21810,"oh my god man, was it hot?"
21811,imagine having a mean boss and having to wear that all day ha
21812,"Hooray, celebrate and have fun until you have to start working and it all begins again."
21813,Be happy dude cause your on to a new chapter in your life. But whatever you do make sure you wake up every day wanting to do it.
21814,why is that?? what do they have that you dont have?
21815,"Yesh that can be hard to deal with, but I believe you will have it all one day too."
21816,Were you nervous and what for?
21817,"Oh no, how old was he? "
21818,why do you feel that way? what is going on?
21819,never be that way! you are amazing and perfect and awesome!
21820,Good job! You must be so proud of yourself.
21821,Maybe its time to launch your art career full time.
21822,"thats honestly amazing, keep it up and never go back."
21823,"yes, i have been fighting my weight my whole life."
21824,That is very mean of them. How did you react?
21825,I hope it wasn't too scary for you and you can laugh it off now.
21826,Oh my god! how have you been bathing?
21827,"oh my, don't lift up your arms!"
21828,That sounds bad. Do you feel lonely now?
21829,"I agree, I guess they weren't a good friend after all "
21830,"oh now man, thats terrible.  She didnt deserve such an amazing person like you."
21831,thats no good at all! you may feel better after you sleep yeah?
21832,"That must be a great feeling, huh?"
21833,i'm glad to hear that!
21834,"Uh oh, well with all of the things you do for him, I think he will survive."
21835,LOL I would be slightly upset im not gonna lie.
21836,Does she fulfil every need for you? 
21837,"That's so reassuring to hear, that true love is still out there"
21838,what happened? how long have you been waiting?
21839,yay! that is amazing! when do you atart?
21840,Yum! Pizza for breakfast? My favorite.
21841,Yes enjoy the weekend lol
21842,Go back to sleep!
21843,"I agree, just a read a boring book and you will be snoozing in no time"
21844,I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried looking up organizations in your new area to meet people with similar interests?
21845,"How about church, a fundraising activity, or volunteer opportunity to meet new people?"
21846,"Aw, were you too busy to go?"
21847,Oh no! I hate when that happens. Are you feeling any better?
21848,"Aw, that's so nice of you! I bet she appreciated it"
21849,Keep doing things like that! Parents appreciate little thoughts like that more than we know
21850,Oh man I would be so mad...did he apologize at all
21851,Yeah sounds like he needs a taste of his own medicine lol
21852,That's great! I bet you love that
21853,"Haha, well dogs do that. I highly recommend not letting the puppy lick your face while it's young"
21854,I hope it wasn
21855,"(*oops).  I hope you apologized to him.  If it was milk, I wouldn't cry over it too much.  ;)"
21856,"Aw, I hope your dog is much better trained now"
21857,I never took my dog to doggie school and I regretted it. She could have done with some more discipline. 
21858,That's terrific. Do they speak English there?
21859,That's a good idea. I hope you have fun!
21860,"That stinks, did they give you fair notice so you had chance to find a new place?"
21861,"I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you can find something quickly."
21862,Why are people so inconsiderate. Are you ok?
21863,"Yea, it's not enough that you drive safe sometimes."
21864,That's great! I hope she gets it!
21865,Is this for her dream job?
21866,"uh oh, someone is in trouble."
21867,hahaha a party is a light way to put it.
21868,"Oh? Is it a family, group, or some other meaningful photo?"
21869,"OH! haha, well you learn something new every day. Noodles sounds good though"
21870,That sounds awesome. Enjoy your day off!
21871,"Oh you got the place all to yourself, too?"
21872,Oh my goodness. That's terrible.  Did you take him to the Vet right away?
21873,Do you know whose dog it is?
21874,"Wow, that is coming up soon.  I be you are excited.  Is this your first child?"
21875,That was thoughtful of them.  It is always nice to have a fun surprise!
21876,That would be so annoying!
21877,I don't blame you for that. I would do the same.
21878,"You get nervous, hu?"
21879,Have you been on a date recently?
21880,That's cool.  Are you a dancer
21881,Cool. Do you like it so far?
21882,That's terrible. How did they do that?
21883,Did it ever get resolved?
21884,Why you shouldn't have text her?
21885,"Nice, what did you order"
21886,"Well better be careful, you might end up opening someone else's mail lol"
21887,That's awesome. do you usually exercise in the mornings?
21888,"I usually feel better when I exercise, but I've been putting it off."
21889,"That's impressive, was it difficult to make?"
21890,I guess it probably requires a lot of practice to get the technique down.
21891,Check-ups can be nerve wrecking sometimes.
21892,I understand that. There are way too many illnesses that are out of our control.
21893,really? i tortoise? i have one in my backyard too!
21894,he is my pet.. i have had him 10 years.. he is about 70lbs now.. got two more little ones inside 
21895,Oh no. Was there no one to walk home with you?
21896,That's good. Do you have to walk home like that often?
21897,"Good, nothing happened."
21898,Oh wow. That must be embarassing!
21899,Guess you don't like her anymore then.
21900,Oh that's cool.  Sounds like he's living the dream lol
21901,Do you have any kids of your own...or is he your main / only furbaby
21902,Nice! How often do you get haircuts?
21903,Your hair must grow really quick!
21904,That is good. I am glad to hear that you are comfortable with life.
21905,I am sure your wife feels that she is the lucky one.
21906,That really stinks. Maybe  you both can take some time off of work and be together?
21907,Well you should sit down with him and have a talk with him about it. 
21908,That's terrible news. I hope they are in good hands. Are you okay?
21909,"I am glad. But I hope you are doing okay! Get out and meet some cool people (Easier said than done, I know)."
21910,heh well at least you can be here while working
21911,maybe next time
21912,ooooh I would be too!  I had someone dent my car too last week.  I feel your pain!
21913,Nope!  Try paintless dent repair. Its not too pricey and quick fix.
21914,Sorry to hear that. Are you taking him to the vet?
21915,I understand. That is life.
21916,"That's really nice of them, did they help you move your heavy appliances and stuff too?"
21917,"Oh, either way that's still very generous of them and I'd certainly be grateful to have someone like that."
21918,im staying in.. its raining cats and dogs
21919,What type of pet
21920,Oh that's pretty cool...is it full grown or still a baby
21921,I would have been too. Were you at a store parking lot or at work?
21922,That is so awful. I guess they didn't bother to leave a note?
21923,oh dang that stinks
21924,Why? What was going on?
21925,That's disappointing. 
21926,Well I'm sure you've both got your own unique skills...what would you say are 3 things you do well?
21927,That's really awesome! What kind of lyrics do you write?
21928,what do you think is going to happen?
21929,ah well good luck
21930,Why do you need a day off?
21931,Nice. Some leisure time is always good.
21932,"Haha, well that's to be expected I guess. Do you play the lottery often?"
21933,"I think it's fun to buy one every now and then, but wouldn't be my go-to for entertaining gambling."
21934,Yum that sounds delicious. You're making me hungry.
21935,You should just get a half vegetarian. No need to punish your self like that.
21936,yea tell me about it... im still paying off cc's from when my wife and i were dating :p
21937,heh
21938,Why's that
21939,Oh I feel ya.  No kids yet so I'm soaking up all the freedom I can hahaha
21940,That's great. Practice makes perfect.   
21941,Keep at it. Maybe one day you can start selling those drawings for money.
21942,heh .. it was ok but kinda boring in a theater
21943,well at least you saw it then.. some people wont even try
21944,I can understand.  Then are times when I want to get out of work too.
21945,Sometimes it is helpful to take a break and go home early.  It allows you to kind of reset.
21946,thats awesome.. how long did that take
21947,I hope it's paid too.
21948,Are you going somewhere for a vacation?
21949,I love fossils!
21950,What do you like about them>
21951,What's going on Monday?
21952,"Yeah, I guess that will be like a vacation for you."
21953,why would it be wrong?
21954,ah yea it happens
21955,Oh no! Is it serious?
21956,Well I hope that it isn't serious and your dog makes it through
21957,Congradulations.  I assume it comes with a pay raise.
21958,with a window?
21959,Awesome.  I'm almost a little jealous
21960,what do you mean? did you get stuck somewhere?
21961,"lammee, did you atleast finish up the file?"
21962,did you throw him out?
21963,did it work?
21964,"That's terrible! I'm really sorry to hear that, but even if you could have said something it doesn't just make it better."
21965,Is that what happened to her? My mother was like that as well. It's terrible to watch somebody you loved turn into someone else because of an addiction.
21966,"That would be annoying. If there is anybody over him, you might try reporting it first."
21967,"Lol , Maybe you could ask for another department"
21968,"Man I have recently been getting into shoes, I dont have nearly as many as some of my buddies,  need to step my game up."
21969,"I just like the style, I want to show off with ever outfit."
21970,Oh hate when that happens.  How did you know you acted a fool
21971,You'll figure it out.  I believe in you
21972,I hate that. I'm glad you're ok!
21973,We all do stupid stuff as kids.  The important thing is you realize how bad that behavior is now.
21974,"I understand regret over previous actions, but you just got to move forward."
21975,Good for him! The only time I've ever gotten a hole in one in golf is on a video game. 
21976,It's definitly a really hard thing to do. Your friend must be really lucky!
21977,i can see that
21978,The powerball drawing is tonight ;)
21979,Car door?
21980,When did that happen?
21981,I just found one in my toilet the other night!
21982,How bad was it?
21983,That's really cool that you have those awesome memories. Do you ever go baack and see your family?
21984,Well I hope you have a good time!
21985,Have you always had this fear of the dark
21986,Is there any specific reason why?
21987,have you ever been there before? I hear it's great!
21988,Save up and sign up for deal alerts on expedia and other sites. It's really amazing how cheap you can get trips nowadays!
21989,"Oh wow, where do you get these pets? from a shelter or off the street?"
21990,"oh wow, thats good of you to be able to bring in dogs off the street."
21991,"wow thats great, is that the one you got off the street?"
21992,well i wish you good luck on that one!
21993,Oh my god..I would be too! No locks?
21994,Oh...I have locks on all my gates and the companies have to ask for permission. That is terrible! Did you get your dog back?
21995,Have you tried find a away to keep the seperated?
21996,I'm sure that it will get better. Dogs are really smart so if you keep working with her I'm sure she will get it. 
21997,Oh my gosh! It sound like she has a had a rough life. You are great for taking care of her!
21998,I am bad with anxiety too but if you haven't done anything wrong then all you can do is try to have some self confidence and prepare for the worst and HOPE for the best. You never know- you could be getting a raise!
21999,Prepare then and you will feel better- either way it goes you will be prepared- so if it's bad- you will already have known and if it's not- then you will get surprised. Either way it won't rock your world.
22000,Oh man! Well all you can do is prepare early as you just never know! Life isfull of change.
22001,That's pretty awesome.  What breed
22002,"That's pretty generous of you to adopt an abused dog, especially a pregnant one.  That's a lot of responsibility but I love pitbulls too so I would've done the same"
22003,Well of course..Like all the drunks and druggies begging for money who won't work on my corner? Most people are poor..and work hard!
22004,Poor people are the hardest workers in america usually..It's corps that have a HUGE pay gap and the CEOs make ridiculous money while the people keeping the companies don't even make a living wage
22005,Oh no. I'm sorry :(
22006,Pets are great but they sure are tragic.
22007,That's good that you were prepared! Puppys can be a handful.
22008,Man that does sound like a handful!
22009,I hear you! Tell me about your family?
22010,Why did you move away from home? That is cool to have a brother in highschool. Highschoolers usually aren't home much anyhow 
22011,Oh my goodness! That would be so hard!!
22012,You the pitbull guy? haha
22013,Gal :)) what did you end up naming the pup?
22014,"It's rare to have great parents it seems, I am glad you have good ones!"
22015,"I feel the same about my mom! Wonderful! Remember to cherish them daily, as we never know what can happen and aren't promised tomorrow"
22016,"Aww, I hate to hear that. How long have you two been together?"
22017,"Well, hopefully when it's all said and done it'll be be worth it. Best of luck with it."
22018,I have never actually had one of those! We don't get very exotic fruits here in the midwest. What do they taste like?
22019,"Never had sunflower seeds. I love Pomegranate juice though. Sounds interesting. Do they taste anything like a watermelon, or more like a raspberry?"
22020,I LOVE watermelon...Geez- I could literally sit and eat a whole one by myself. My complexion always looks better after watermelon too
22021,LOL! I know..my sister hates them..but I don't like most veggies :( Rapsberrys are a close second!
22022,"Why, the odds are not in your favor"
22023,"Ha, its never bad to try though"
22024,so what was plan B?
22025,oh that sounds good.
22026,When is it due out?
22027,Who is your favorite Marvel hero?
22028,That sounds really great and delicious! 
22029,Ohhhhhh yeah that's no good. Still that happens to me all the time so I wouldn't worry too much about it. 
22030,Does anything awesome ever end up happening?
22031,That's whats up
22032,who did they leave and where?
22033,"Oh no, I hate that"
22034,Maybe he comes back or you find him
22035,That sounds creepy
22036,I guess ignore it for now
22037,Sounds like a relaxing day.
22038,Is it your day off?
22039,Well that comes in handy.
22040,ah.. take it to the bank to find out
22041,That's really awesome! What are you going to be doing with your time?
22042,Well that's good! A little rest and relaxation is always good!
22043,Whys that?
22044,Excellent
22045,Oh no! Where were you coming from?
22046,Yikes! Did you get home okay? Normally I weave different ways when I think that
22047,I am sure tomorrow will be fine
22048,"I am sorry, I hope tomorrow is different then"
22049,That's great that you were so confident. I wish I could be like that.
22050,That's great that you have that kind of personal growth
22051,it made him a ton of money so i think thats all that mattered to him at that point cause i agree it was crap.
22052,"that was back then when he was trying to do something great, the drive isnt there when you have already done it"
22053,that was nice of them.
22054,always good to have friends like that
22055,What pet does she have?
22056,Oh wow. Don't think I've ever seen one of those.
22057,i get that. i am in pain every morning and get up and go to work everyday. so it's hard to find sympathy from me
22058,exactly. it really drives me nuts when people feel like they entitled to this or that.
22059,Hmm maybe it's not your time yet...I'm sure you'll get there
22060,"I wish you abundant joy, success health and wealth in all areas of your life."
22061,Awesome. That's a whole lotta pizza slices.
22062,Awesome I hope you enjoy it.  Don't get too fat.
22063,I am so sorry to hear that. Who is taking care of your neighbor?
22064,That's really sad. Not being able to even know what's going on anymore.
22065,I understand! Did you get in trouble?
22066,Good officer for once! That is good to hear!
22067,Oh no! Why was she starved?
22068,Some people should not be in charge of another living being.
22069,Rainy?
22070,Yuck
22071,That's true. What's going on?
22072,Some people are only out for themselves unfortunately.
22073,Oh wow! What does it look like now?
22074,Going to miss who?
22075,thats a nice gift for a cat.
22076,80% wow that is cool.
22077,What is going on Monday?
22078,"LOOOOL! They go back in september here. Oh yey, relaxing time!"
22079,That's wonderful to hear!
22080,What's been going on in your life?
22081,Bummer.  You still keep in touch with her or what
22082,"Nice.  Give the newbie a chance, I'm sure she'll come around.  What kind of work do you do"
22083,That must be frustrating. What are you going to do now?
22084,I'm so sorry that happened. What brand is the HD?
22085,Yes. Why did you bought that many popcorn kernels?
22086,"Dang that stinks, better luck next time."
22087,thats good that you are trying!
22088,Do you know how it happened?
22089,That sucks. I hate people who do stuff like that and don't take responsibility.
22090,"That sounds like so much fun -- and like a break you're looking forward to, yes?"
22091,Have you been before? It seems like such a great way to both play and get a workout ;-)
22092,That's very nice of her!
22093,Your brother is a lucky guy!
22094,I am not sure how anyone could like those things
22095,I do not like them either though
22096,That poor dog
22097,That all sounds horrible
22098,Did they just not care?
22099,Sometimes they are tired at the end of their shift. It happens
22100,what are you saving up for?
22101,wow i wish i could be like you :)
22102,Why is he missing and is he home?/
22103,"Oh god, some dogs have to be watched a lot! Watch the shelters and put up flyers everywhere online"
22104,Which part
22105,"Hm that's pretty useful info right there...you must be quite the handyman/woman, I would've probably just bought another one lol"
22106,I know right? I love the side hustle!
22107,No idea what that means but it sounds good! lol
22108,where do you want to go.
22109,oh wow that sounds cool
22110,what's happening next week?
22111,aren't we talking about the kids going back to school?
22112,I hope the cat likes it
22113,"That is great, I am glad you got it"
22114,What happened? Was he honest with you?
22115,Ugh! Did he offer an explanation yet?
22116,I think a lot of parents are!
22117,Were they a handful over the summer?
22118,is there anything that can be done to save it
22119,what does she plan to do if she cant?
22120,It happens a lot
22121,Was it a long wait
22122,thats always nice to have time to sit and relax
22123,good for you.
22124,"I am sorry, any reason why?"
22125,"Some drunks are funny, and some are unfortunately annoying as hell."
22126,"Oh man, all your friends are the annoying drunks?"
22127,You  got lucky.  I don't ever seem to get warnings.
22128,Yeah no kidding. You caught a break.
22129,I am happy that you think your interview was successful.  I know they can be nervewracking sometimes.
22130,I am glad to hear it.  I hope you get the new job!
22131,i bet. that would be a bummer for anyone
22132,i bet. i never play so i can't complain
22133,"ah, i get that. thats good."
22134,Nice what do you do
22135,That's pretty awesome keep grinding
22136,Thats great! You are reaching your goals then?
22137,More information?
22138,That is very sweet. Family is important
22139,I know that feeling for sure
22140,Ah man! You shouldn't feel bad about tripping. Why do you feel bad about it?
22141,Take it in stride. Humility is a great feature to have!
22142,"I get like that, was there a particular reason or just don't like it in general?"
22143,That can be scary. We live in the middle of nowhere so I really panic when I hear something. I totally understand
22144,that sounds like fun. what amusement park?
22145,that is awesome. hope you enjoy yourself
22146,I don't have a green thumb myself. What plants are you growing?
22147,Wow. That's quite a variety! Those cantaloupes will be delicious!
22148,Interesting.  You gonna get new ones
22149,What kind were they
22150,Some people don't realize it's just as easy as being comfortable being yourself to be accepted.
22151,Are you gonna have to see this person again?
22152,"hrmm, did it grow legs and walk away?"
22153,you probably need to think about setting up a search crew
22154,I think we've all gone through that. How many tickets did you buy?
22155,That's good. Not much wasted then.
22156,That sounds great. Are you going to go get brunch after?
22157,That's usually what I do.
22158,"Oh wow, that is great for her"
22159,Its a good thing to be healthy
22160,"That is nice, do you usually go to church? "
22161,"Defenitly, sounds like something that you are your brother can share together and bond!"
22162,I have heard that a lot today! How did yours get out
22163,"Ah! Have you put up flyers, etc?"
22164,that sounds good.
22165,yea its great when things come together.
22166,"Thats awesome, are you in the wedding?"
22167,"Well, atleast you will be happy for him and there."
22168,Oh no! Do you forget birthdays a lot? I do sometimes. Always good to set reminds on your google calender etc
22169,Did you get them a late birthday present/
22170,Saving money is so important
22171,That is very smart to think about
22172,"Yea, you definitely need a break every now and then. Is it vacation time?"
22173,Sounds like you're really tired. Are you going to make it to the end of the year without a break?
22174,that is so cool. i loved the old school computers
22175,i know right. and the aol and dial up screeching in the background
22176,I am sure you will get it eventually
22177,I hope you do not have to do that
22178,You are a great friend!
22179,"Well, she's very lucky to have you during this tough time for her."
22180,I can imagine. Luckily mine don't go far when they do
22181,"I'm sure it was a challenge getting him back home, at least you got some exercise haha"
22182,Oh no!  Why did it take them so long to get back with you?
22183,"That's horrible!  Did you already have plans made for the trip?  I hope you can work it out with them, but if not maybe finding another job that is a bit more accomodating would be beneficial."
22184,Do you mean the biology class was taken at a school?
22185,Wow. That is pretty amazing. Did you enjoy it?
22186,That is nice. Would you be buying your cake there?
22187,I understand. Is it close to your home?
22188,That's very kind of you. How long has he lost his job?
22189,3 months isn't too bad. I hope he stays strong.
22190,who won?
22191,he'll get them next time.
22192,People usually dread Mondays. What's happening that day?
22193,Oh hahaha. A lot of my friends have been tweeting about that.
22194,"Cats are very fun, sometimes"
22195,I am sure its a nice cat too
22196,"uh oh, did something happen?"
22197,What usually happens this tiem of year?
22198,I can't wait for it to cool  down. It's so hot here.
22199,Texas.  It was in the 90's today.
22200,"Oh man, that kind of thing would make me furious. Do you have any idea who it might have been?"
22201,"Yeah, I hate it. Parents need to start raising their kids better."
22202,"I'm sure they aren't though, hahahaha."
22203,I hope the one who doesn't want to return at least gets to spend more time with their friends.
22204,you should probably go to the doctor
22205,well it might help you get rid of them a little quicker or find the underlying issue
22206,What's your plan?
22207,aw is he usually clingy?
22208,What kind of cake was it
22209,"I am glad, you deserve a treat every once and awhile"
22210,That sounds pretty amazing. Is the place you go to nearby?
22211,Oh that's actually not that bad. How long are you guys going for?
22212,I hope you do not get sick!
22213,I guess you were hungru
22214,"That's pretty awesome, I've never played before! It is hard to learn?"
22215,"I bet! Good luck, I hope you win some good money!"
22216,"That's unfortunate, made a new one since?"
22217,"That's terrible, I hope you find someone soon."
22218,so do you wait till you are back at home?
22219,yea thats understandable 
22220,oh no. did you find it?
22221,have you tried the shelters or local vets?
22222,Being alone is good sometimes!
22223,Yep. You should definitely do the things you wouldn't normally do with people around!
22224,Wow that's a strange thing. Any idea why that happened?
22225,Haha must think you guys are the luckiest on the block.
22226,"I am glad, what grade did you get"
22227,"Oh wow, that is great"
22228,That sucks. Have you tried contacting your family?
22229,"Well, you're talking to me so that's something."
22230,I don't blame you. Work is a drag
22231,hate it
22232,im sorry  to hear that
22233,yea this is true
22234,That never sounds fun
22235,I am sorry you had to work then
22236,"Aww I'm sorry, i hope you atleast got some good relaxing time alone!"
22237,That's great! Enjoy the weekend and have a good week!
22238,did you pull over or keep pushing through
22239,well at least you made it safely through!
22240,What grades are they in
22241,"Oh wow, that is a lot of school"
22242,do you think its going to happen?
22243,thats good.
22244,I hate that. Work is never fun on the weekends
22245,That sounds very painful
22246,Oh I love trying new things for me! Everyone deserves spoiling sometimes
22247,I have that problem too. Most feel heavy and make me sweat. I really hope it's just right for you
22248,Great! What kind of job and how good of a promotion?
22249,Oh great! Hopefully a nice chunk of change :)
22250,Are you going to get the right part?
22251,I am sure you can find help online
22252,Congrats! What kind of job is it?
22253,Great! What kind of stuff will you be doing?
22254,Its instinctive. They  pretty much know what to do by instinct.
22255,That's great to hear.  I'm glad it worked out.
22256,i don't really follow players when they get so big that they seem like they are getting too big for their britches
22257,i used to live in miami and that was a big deal when he was part of the white hot heat
22258,ah yes its always nice to take a moment to remember the past
22259,thats wonderful to hear! take care.
22260,Why was it without you?
22261,Well that can't be helped. What kind of trip was it?
22262,"No, not if he is being loud and rude, that is never okay"
22263,I guess he has no care for anyone but himself
22264,did he get a beat down?
22265,ah well in that case thats a good move.
22266,What kind of pet was it?
22267,"Very cool lizards, I like their beards."
22268,"Oh wow, I'm sure she will understand! My send some nice flowers and a sorry card."
22269,"A mothers love is unconditional, she will forgive you :)"
22270,"Just be careful, I am sure you know what you are doing"
22271,I am glad you go! What kind of church is it?
22272,What are they doing tomorrow?
22273,Why did you have to cancel?
22274,I can understand that - unfortunately some times we have to do those annoying things in order to keep things level.
22275,Were the people involved ok?
22276,"Always that bad egg everywhere. It's people like that, that causes accidents."
22277,yes i cant wait for it to be over!
22278,yea we have the AC on way too much in the summers
22279,What's going on next week?
22280,"Oh yea, how could I forget that. How many kids do you have?"
22281,Wow congratulations! Will it be a big ceremony?
22282,"That's smart, I think big weddings are a waste of money honestly."
22283,It's good to have friends you can count on like that.
22284,You're right. They're pretty rare.
22285,Yeah its really hot here. I can't wait for it to cool off.
22286,it was in the 90's today
22287,aw that's so sweet. I hope it goes well.
22288,Is it your first date with the person?
22289,sounds like my wife
22290,i set the clocks ahead in the house and in the car .. it doesnt work all the time but it helps 
22291,Nice. How many tickets did ya get?
22292,Good luck! How'd you choose the numbers?
22293,how do you feel like it went?
22294,that would be amazing. when will you know?
22295,They still have not taken notice?
22296,"That's very unfortunate, hopefully that changes."
22297,What happened to your dog?
22298,I'm sorry to hear that.  are you going to get another doggo?
22299,Wow. Did the roach make it?
22300,Dang. You sure told him!
22301,Congratulations! How did you go about losing so much weight?
22302,"Oh I can relate, I love food a lot and it's a curse and a blessing."
22303,"Man, that sounds really delicious. Where'd you get the recipe?"
22304,"Your boss sounds pretty amazing. I want to work with you guys, hahaha."
22305,"Oh wow, that must be confusing, scary and fustrating!"
22306,Exactly! no one is going to take the warnings seriously!
22307,Really? Can you explain that more?
22308,That's amazing. I really am impressed for your dog.
22309,"Aww, that's sad. I have been there more than I like to admit."
22310,I'm sure if he's a good brother he will understand. My family is always happy to receive food as a gift because it's made with love.
22311,wow that is awesome that you were able to do that
22312,everyone needs to get out in the real world to stay sane!
22313,That is sad. What was the gift she wanted?
22314,"wow, she is asking too much. Every kid want a horse."
22315,Good life partners are hard to find. You hold on to him.
22316,How long have you two been together?
22317,oh really how?
22318,haha that is great
22319,"ohh, strange. Keep an eye on him."
22320,Yes. Be safe. Call police in emergency.
22321,"Oh no, what happened next?"
22322,I'm glad nothing happened.
22323,"wow, she should be very good?"
22324,That is very good.
22325,That's terrible! You are being nice to try and help her.
22326,Hopefully she can find something else quickly so she doesn't worry so much
22327,wow thats a great score!
22328,hard work pays off as they say.
22329,"I actually don't know too much about basketball, so I really don't have a strong opinion on that. Is that a bad thing?"
22330,I guess he's confident that he can do well with any team.
22331,That's great! Do you have a traditional job or do you work for yourself?
22332,I know it's hard when you're not sure if you can make enough money. Was there a change that made you feel better about it?
22333,O really? how'd she react to hearing that?
22334,I'm sure something really frustrating happened first.
22335,oh my were they able to take it?
22336,what a fool. where the cops able to catch him?
22337,that stinks. hopefully he won't try it again on you or anyone else for that matter.
22338,me either. i'm sorry you had to go thru that.
22339,Yeah that's annoying.  Welcome to the problems of having an attactive mate.
22340,Take it as a compliment.
22341,Yes it is.  Its unavoidable though. People suck.
22342,"I'm so sorry, it's hard to lose our animals, they become a part of our family."
22343,"The pain never really goes completely away, but it does get easier to deal with."
22344,"ohh, that's bad. I feel sorry for her"
22345,Don't worry. She will recover. I will pray for her
22346,Why? Did he steal it? haha
22347,"Oh wow, that is low! Hate men like that, that won't support their children."
22348,Well that is very nice of you.  Is it a pretty big project?
22349,That is great.  I sure they are very thankful for the lep
22350,Oh thats scary! 
22351,Im sorry to hear that! Maybe next time it will be better or try another way to travel that is better.
22352,"Why was she so late, thats terrible"
22353,I'm so sorry. I hope she makes it up for her.
22354,"ohh that's nice. Legos was one of my favorite games, when I was a kid"
22355,"Yes, today's kids! They just stick to their ipad."
22356,I have not - do you enjoy watching him?
22357,He is pretty amazing!
22358,Oh wow that does sound scary! Are you okay? Any damage to your home?
22359,That's good! I know insurance can be a pain to deal with!
22360,Wow. It is so nice of him. I am supprissed that the pick up lasted 12 years.
22361,That is a very solid truck that you have.
22362,Oh no! Did you have any sort of security cameras to see who did it?
22363,That's horrible. I hope you can find a way to recoup what was lost quickly and move on.
22364,Is that a movie?
22365,"Oh wow, that certainly sounds like a sad movie for sure!"
22366,Cool. Has it been taking a long time_
22367,I hope to move into a house next year
22368,"Ouch, was it way worse then normal due to weather?"
22369,"That's scary, i hate driving in storms."
22370,I bet! Hopefully you can take some time off and go see them soon!
22371,"I understand, I'm sure your family misses you as well. Maybe you can meet half way for the holidays."
22372,My kids just started back Thurs and my new semester starts then too. I definitely understand
22373,I'm sure it'll go fine. Usually the jitters are worse than it actually is
22374,Were they pokay
22375,"Oh well, I am sure they have moved on"
22376,ohh good for you. But why is that?
22377,"ohh that's cool. I have never been there at such place. But, I am happy for you."
22378,Why does she do that
22379,"That sounds bad, I feel bad for you"
22380,Time sure flies doesn't it - what is it about this time of year that takes you back?
22381,"ah yes, those were the days - the carefree days of summer!  Now we just work - LOL!"
22382,"I like those as well, what are some of yours"
22383,Oh that sounds so nice
22384,what is 4 for?
22385,it was like monsoon weather here too. it's depressing and my garden is suffering
22386,That must have been an embarsing situation but we've all been there.
22387,haha I'm sure it'll be a good story to tell and hopefully you can laugh about it now.
22388,That's a bummer!  Were you upset about it?
22389,"yeah, I can understand that.  Maybe next time you'll get to go and he'll have to work!"
22390,It must be nice to be rich
22391,"I am sorry, just be yourself"
22392,O yea? what kind would that be?
22393,"Nice, I love thigns like that, so important I feel."
22394,That's sad to hear - it's hard to find a true good friend.  How far away are they moving?
22395,Hopefully you will be able to visit and vice versa  - but it's never really the same is it?
22396,I am sorry. I am sure he appreciates you being there for him
22397,Its good he has such good care
22398,"Oh yeah, that was a great feeling to have, especially as a child."
22399,It's the same with me and my finacee. We'll just go somewhere nice for dinner or something. That childhood magic was the best.
22400,that's awesome. i really want to go camping but we haven't been able to yet
22401,are you going somewhere local or going out of town ?
22402,that is always fun. enjoy your time.
22403,That would be disappointing. What will you do?
22404,That's too bad. Good luck with that.
22405,I bet you are proud of her
22406,Sounds like a smart girl
22407,how sweet. what did they do on their special day?
22408,i get that. i wish we had children so my husband could do that.
22409,In what areas?
22410,I hope that you all meet and exceed your goals.  It's great to have goals to work towards.
22411,"That sucks, did they just study more or what happened?"
22412,I would be too. Well maybe you'll get a better grade than him next year
22413,But don't feel dejected. Your time will come. I pray for your bright future.
22414,"I am sorry, are you okay"
22415,What kind of car
22416,I bet it is so cute! What breed is it?
22417,Oh I love those! Well at least you can go over and play with it anytime you want without having to clean up after it lol
22418,Is there a way you could go and see him?
22419,I'm sorry you won't get to see him this weekend - perhaps you can have a nice long phone call or skype or something to catch up until you can see him again.
22420,That sounds hard
22421,That does sounds sounds to me
22422,You dont like your neighbors?
22423,That is a nice feeling
22424,Cool. I haven't ben to chrch in a while
22425,I should make time to go though
22426,Well congrats! Is it kindergarten?
22427,"Mine are in 1st, 6th, and 9th grade this year so I know what you mean."
22428,Uh oh. I think everyone does that sometimes.
22429,Don't be too hard on yourself.
22430,Does your boss has thought it is you?
22431,"Hopefully, he will forget about it."
22432,i hope that you will get the job that is going to be what is best for you. stay positive.
22433,"that is important. like my grandma always tells me ""like attracts like"" so be what you want to attract to you."
22434,What do you plan on doing with your time off?
22435,Maybe a quick shot to the beach.
22436,What kind of school
22437,That sucks. Maybe you can go next weekend
22438,"Well that's mighty convenient, was it delicious?"
22439,What! It's not even a salad without a ton of lettuce! I hope you called and complained!
22440,That's great. So you are confident in the progress of it?
22441,That's a great feeling to have. A job well done.
22442,Rain can be annoying when it comes to that
22443,Hopefully it will be sunny then
22444,"That must have been so scary, did you kill him?"
22445,That's awful he might be in your house.
22446,That's awful. How did it catch on fire?
22447,Do you have home owners insurance?
22448,I'm sure it will all work out.
22449,Did you enjoy it there?
22450,That is hard when you are young.  My family moved around a lot until I was 13.
22451,Good for you! How was your first experience?
22452,I am really happy for you. Hope i'll be a dad one day.
22453,Me too! This heat in Texas is killing me.
22454,"Yes, I have family in Nashville and they said it's been hot!"
22455,Did you enjoy yourself?
22456,"Ah, so not just a little town festival - ya'll did it big!!  It sounds amazing!"
22457,Your cat must have got treats for that.
22458,"That's brutal, my cat plays with her kills too."
22459,What's your issue?
22460,"That's rough, being an adult has it's perk though!"
22461,What do you miss most?
22462,"That is the best to be fair, maybe some day when we grow old we can be ignorant again."
22463,OH no. Does he have a problem?
22464,Well hopefully he will get better
22465,Calculus 1?
22466,Just wait til you get to calc II... that's the miserable one.
22467,"It really does, what job do you work at?"
22468,Do you have any plans to try and get back at your boss?
22469,You should get on that soon.
22470,"Oh nice, have you met them yet?"
22471,"Sounds scary, I hope they aren't involved in drugs or crime."
22472,"You must so excited, does he play any sports?"

22480,"I'm glad to hear that, must've been a pain to wait."
22481,Which video game did you order?
22482,"You must be so excited, is it your favorite game?"
22483,"I would be too!  My mom got her degree recently as well, so I know the feeling."
22484,"She was studying Hospital Administration.  Funny thing though, I'm studying accounting myself right now."
22485,"I'm so sorry to hear that, what kind of cancer?"
22486,"That's awful, are you on chemo?"
22487,That is nice. Who was the singer?
22488,Are you big fan?
22489,At least you took the steps to do it congratulations.
22490,As long as it's done and you stay committed I'm not to far from you I start back the 31st of this month as well and I waited 5 years to go back we got this.
22491,Thank you same to you.
22492,Oh no!  Did he get a tummy ache?
22493,That is just disrespectful!  He should have stayed on his own stairs if he was going to make a mess like that!
22494,Cool. I love ballet
22495,Wow! How old is she
22496,What does she like to draw?
22497,"Still cute though, you must be proud."

22506,Smart thinking! Cats are always good scapegoats lol
22507,How old are they now?
22508,Why do you want them to be babies again?  That sounds like a lot of waking up in the middle of the night.
22509,That will pass. Just give it a little time :)
22510,Oh the memories
22511,What was in there?
22512,What I woluldnt do for my old game boy.

22516,"Oh yeah, that's huge talent right there! I really wish I was like that!"
22517,Are you happy?
22518,I know that feeling. I still have a few more years.
22519,"I think they are fun to be. Especially, during Halloween, it gives you goosebumps and excitement of the moment"
22520,Life is short. Fill it with some does of such moments to live and remember when you become old
22521,"That's so bad, did you call a plumber?"
22522,"Thanks always good, poor kid must be sad."
22523,How old are they really?
22524,Wow yes they do they must be stress free and have good genes to look so young hopefully the kids don't disturb you though lol.

22528,That sucks. What was the reason?
22529,"You must be so happy, what animal?"
22530,"That's awesome, I have no luck with those."
22531,Really? What kind? Is it a puppy or is it full grown?
22532,Awe huskies are the cutest dogs ever!
22533,I'm not prepared.
22534,"I need some food, any suggestions?"
22535,Did you not get a good grade on it?
22536,Well it could be worse. You'll do better next time I'm sure of it.
22537,Tell your buddy I said congrats! What team was it?
22538,Awesome! Maybe a recruiter from a good college will see them play and give them a scholarship!
22539,"that must've been embarrassing, how did you recover?"
22540,You're so kind she will love that.
22541,Did you remember extra underwear and your toothbrush?
22542,"Awesome, where are you going?"

22545,You must be excited.
22546,Which park are you going too?
22547,I think you're gonna do great!
22548,Math is really hard but I got faith in you. You're gonna make an A+ I know it.
22549,"Did she recently do something to make you think that, or has she always been that way?"
22550,"I have two daughters myself, so I know where you are coming from."
22551,That sucks. Did she get a better job?
22552,Oh that sucks
22553,Whos that?
22554,Can you reapply?
22555,Find somewhere else they dont deserve you
22556,What did she send you as a gift?
22557,"I hope not too, you'd be better off keeping it."
22558,Does it fit you nicely?
22559,That is amazing hard work pays off and I think it is great that our kids know how to swim.
22560,How old is he that is great my daughter is 5 I think that will be one of my goals for the remainder of the summer teaching her the basics of swimming without her life jacket. 
22561,What kind of skates it that?
22562,"O, nice, do you play a lot?"
22563,Oh no! What happened after?
22564,What a night lol
22565,What did you have?
22566,Oh man that's my favorite! Did you bring home a doggy bag to eat later?
22567,Are you married too?
22568,"Well you're the smart one, make sure you wait for the right person before you get married!"
22569,Me too. I have one more day
22570,I think you will make it
22571,I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together?
22572,"Well, hang in there. I know it sucks but eventually the right person will come along"
22573,You must be lonely because of that.
22574,Where did he fly off too?
22575,"That is random, where does he work?"
22576,That's good to have a bunch of people working with you that are fast and good at their job. I bet it makes everyone's job a lot easier.
22577,I remember days like that - they always seem to last forever!
22578,"is it gonna feel better , when they finally start going back to school ?"
22579,"my little sister is the same way, these new kids my dad would make me go landscaping with him for my back to school clothes"
22580,Do you have to make a presentation
22581,well congrats!! hopefully it  was a good raise for everybody
22582,that's so sad and why was that?
22583,"Oh, no!  I hate to hear that.  What type of dog was she?"
22584,It is so hard when we have to say goodbye to anyone - even to our loyal friends.  Why did you have to get rid of her?
22585,"Well, I just have to say how sorry I am that you had to let he go.  Maybe you can keep visiting her at least. "
22586,Do you have a night light?
22587,"That's such a good idea, did the scary movies ruin you?"
22588,"Don't worry, you'll do great! You're very articulate and confident."
22589,I think you got this. Don't stress it.
22590,"There's plenty to talk about with sports, you'll have enough content to fill up ten minutes!"
22591,"That's brutal, was it a big poop?"
22592,"That is gross, did you get a bath or a shower?"
22593,Oh is it nice there? I've never been
22594,That sounds lovely
22595,"Oh yeah that sounds like a real good time, I love steak!"
22596,"I have actually, what rank are you?"
22597,"It's the worst, I like to play some priest."
22598,That was so sweet - were you surprised?
22599,Aww - I'm glad he surprised you like that!
22600,Oh no! Did you quit too?
22601,Well that's very loyal of you. I'm sure your boss will appreciate it. Maybe you'll get a promotion!
22602,Is she going to start a college? Why is she moving?
22603,I am a bit confused. Was it a transfer from work or what?
22604,That's cool. Was it the newest one?
22605,Good idea
22606,"It'll happen to you soon, your soulmate is out there somewhere."
22607,Hey that might be a good idea! Nobody knows what you like better than you!
22608,how was it?
22609,that makes no sense lol
22610,I always found them good. Why would you prefer the ones in the early 2000s? 
22611,I understand. I remind me when I was kid.
22612,"That's awful, I would recommend some posters."
22613,Awesome! What kind of dog did you get?
22614,Awe how cute! Huskies are some of the funniest dogs! They always have the funniest expressions!
22615,Are you prepared?
22616,What kind of math is on the test?
22617,"That is weird, I like calculus a lot."
22618,Oh no! Did they say anything about it?
22619,Well at least you didn't run off after it happened like some would have done.
22620,"That's great, that means you're prepared"
22621,Good luck! not like you'll need it :)
22622,oh why was that? did he/she do anything exceptionally?
22623,that was really nice!! you must have been chuffed for him!!
22624,What kind of pet?
22625,"How cute, what's his name?"
22626,"Cool, was it any good? What kind?"
22627,"That's scary, if someone younge ate that and didnt know!"
22628,"that would really make me feel sad , what was the test on"
22629,"just study harder, youll pass eventually i assure you that "
22630,"That's the worst, who's he keeping around?"
22631,"No good, any idea what you're gonna do?"
22632,That's wonderful! Congratulations! What kind of program did you do?
22633,How long have you been working with a trainer?
22634,"Oh I'm sorry to hear that, is that far from where you live now?"
22635,"Yeah, that really sucks. At least it's easier to keep up with people online these days."
22636,"Doesn't surprise me, they do that to me every single time I go. I'm picky though so my order is always complicated."
22637,"I hate onions too, even if I pick them off I can still taste them on the burger. So gross."
22638,I bet it's beautiful! Did she wear it often?
22639,You're so lucky to have that to remember her by
22640,"Hmm, how do you feel about that? "
22641,Lol! Well I'm sure that's not the case! It's cliche for sure but the right person really comes along when you're not expecting it a lot of the time!
22642,Well you must have really liked that pizza!!
22643,"haha  good for you, especially taking from husband  and eating his portion it must have been damn good"
22644,Did they move permanently?
22645,Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. At least now you have a reason to travel
22646,Oh awesome! What kind of puppy are you getting?
22647,Huskies are the best breed! They're so derpy and cute!
22648,My favorites are huskies and big slobbery St Bernards. They give the best hugs and cuddles.
22649,Did he bust his nose?
22650,"That's no good, sorry to hear that, you didn't mean too though!"
22651,"That sounds like a great adventure, where you moving."
22652,"That's fun. Ever been there, it's super fun."
22653,"Aww, I love hamsters! What kind of a hamster was it?"
22654,That's horrible. Is she doing okay now?
22655,Well you go girl! I'm super proud of you!
22656,"But you did and look at you now, miss hottie! "
22657,How fun! Are you dressing up?
22658,Yeah some are a little too intense
22659,"Ah yes, I know what you mean. Nowadays we barely have time to just play games."
22660,"I hate being a grown up, I wish I could go back to the good old days."
22661,"Oh wow, that sounds pretty terrifying!"
22662,"Jesus, that's a lot. Keep your doors locked and a chainsaw handy. Hopefully he's caught soon."
22663,Are you doing anything special for it?
22664,"You could always throw yourself a party. That way you can invite who you want, and avoid seeing people you don't want. Haha"
22665,Oh no! I hope you were wearing clean full coverage underwear that day!
22666,You couldn't tie a sweater around your waist?
22667,wow!! that was really good congrats!! your hard work paid off
22668,am pleased for you
22669,Yay! I knew you could do it!
22670,"Yep, good lecturers always help when you're learning."
22671,"Oh no! Two weeks is a bit long. Works sucks sometimes, huh?"
22672,Make sure to keep in touch!
22673,Weather can really be fickle.  Did you have a back-up plan?
22674,That's not a bad way to spend your day.  That can be just as fun if you get the right kind of movies.  
22675,That's impressive!
22676,"That's still an impressive accomplishment! If they didn't buy it, that just means you get to take it down by yourself again!"
22677,Oh really? Was it pretty exciting then?
22678,That sounds like fun. I think you definitely got your money's worth.
22679,Oh no! Is it close to your house?
22680,Well make sure you stay inside and lock your doors and windows and don't answer your door!
22681,Congrats! That's great!
22682,That is quite an accomplishment and you should be proud!
22683,Are you happy or sad about it? I mean on one hand you have all that time to yourself but at the same time I'm sure you miss them.
22684,"I know what you mean, I feel that way every time my kids go to their grandparents house too."
22685,That sounds like a classic car. Did you used to ride in it with your dad a lot?
22686,Haha that's awesome! Sounds like you had a fun time with it!
22687,"Ugh they do that at my apartment too. You should put a can outside with a big sign that says ""THROW YOUR NASTY BUTTS HERE"""
22688,"I know, it's like it's not that hard to just put them in an ash tray or put it out and throw it in a trash can."
22689,Oh no! Was it damaged?
22690,That's such a relief! Did it clean up easily?
22691,Did you mean cat?
22692,Well sometimes cats like to roam around. I hope he comes back soon. I love cats
22693,Wow! Congrats! I know you were happy about that!
22694,Did he get you the one you wanted?
22695,"That is spo terrible, my dpg died when I was really young, and just have never really had a dog since,"
22696,"Thats how I felt I cried for days, it still doesnt seem real."
22697,You must use it a lot. You will understand it soon
22698,yeah you will do it for sure. i know it
22699,"i would be mad, since i just it to make money online "
22700,"me too, i use it for work , to relax and play games or watch movies on it "
22701,"wow, thats would be very annoying, like someone just rummaging around your room."
22702,"Yeah but kids dont care, Everything is theirs to them,"
22703,Oh no! I hope she's okay! Was she pretty bad?
22704,Maybe she will. Vets are amazing and can do a lot nowadays to save animals. 
22705,That sounds so fun! I would love to have a pool in my yard.
22706,Wow! That is kind of messed up!
22707,Its always great when u have good co-workers you work with.  Im glad you got it done on time!  What kind of project is it may I ask?
22708,"I agree, good co-workers are a must.   I have a good co-workers at my job that I can rely on as well."
22709,It really does! Before you know if she's gonna be borrowing your car keys!
22710,Just cherish her being little all you can. I wish mine were still little like her. 
22711,Yum! Pizza is the best
22712,Oh noooo! That should be illegal!
22713,You must really trust your son. That's wonderful that your son is responsible enough that you can trust him with your debit card.
22714,That's so rare in teenagers! Sounds like you did a great job raising him.
22715,I know what you mean. It's really hard to quit. How long have you been smoking?
22716,Yes you can! Just get some hard candy to keep your mouth busy. That helped me the one time I was able to quit.
22717,"omg i am so jealous of you, honestly im going to get food righht now"
22718,"ughhh, I am goiing to make a PPJ sandwich right now."
22719,"HAHA thats brilliant, I would have done the exact same thing."
22720,"Thats very true, I dont know how I would feel."
22721,"Oh, seems you're lucky."
22722,Fine. Have fun with the money!
22723,"Yes i know that feeling well,  were you happy to look back?"
22724,"thats awesome, I am happy for you, sometimes the past seems like better days"
22725,That's nice! It's always nice to have a good relationship with your sibling
22726,i'm happy for you!
22727,That sounds fun! Who did you go with?
22728,How do you feel about getting the girl's number?
22729,Can't those be clipped? I've never had a dog
22730,Oh. Maybe you should buy plastic stuff then lol
22731,"that would have been great huh, its so nce looking back sometimes."

22733,No i do not. But i wish someday after getting married i will have my own. Do you like kids?
22734,Wow. You have already lived much of your life. I am just 25 and about to start my own. Hopefully it would be filled with children like yours
22735,That's quite interesting.  I need to learn more about cryptocurrency.  I thought that I had missed the opportunity.
22736,I've always wondered if cryptocurrency is as confusing as investing in stocks.  Cryptocurrency reminds me of the Dot.Com frenzy.
22737,Cool. What grade?
22738,I have one in pre-k and an 8th grader now. Makes me feel so old
22739,Were you on good terms?
22740,Wow with a kid involved that's a big no no! I'm sorry you're going through this
22741,Yay. thats one of the most exciting things that can happen in life!
22742,"Yes and i know they will, and you will lice a very happy life."
22743,Good for you. Did you win it in a lottery or what?
22744,Nice. But i do not think gambling is a wise way of putting your hard earned money
22745,I hate being sick
22746,That would be horrible. Have yo seen a doctor?
22747,I bet you didn't enjoy it back then
22748,She sounds like she enjoyed it though lol
22749,"That is nice, do you enjoy them, do you enjoy being a parent?"
22750,"Yes! you will be happy with a boy, you can teach him to be a man."
22751,I love the beach
22752,I haven't been in a while now.
22753,"thats awesome, why cant you go with her, are you busy?"
22754,"that sucks, I wish i didnt gave to work so much either, I just want to travel."
22755,Oh no did it get cancelled?

22767,Did you lock the doors properly? Hope you will not find your office robbed by the morning
22768,I knew it. Did you receive any apprehension for your irresponsibility from management side?
22769,Who is tom?
22770,"Awww, where did you get him?"
22771,"Yeah, friends are the best stress relievers. "
22772,it would have been worth a wait!!
22773,"thats no good, are you going to try to contact them again?"
22774,"oh i see, have you ever talked to him about trying again?"
22775,Did you ever make it?
22776,She didn't have to yell
22777,"wow, thats crazy, did they all pay for them all themselfes."
22778,"thats no fun, why not buy a new one?"
22779,Maybe yo have a bad signal
22780,My tv sed to do that. Then they moved my satellite
22781,"where are you going , im excited for you"

22795,Sorry to hear that. Is there any specific reason for your decision?
22796,"Does he treat differently now than it was before? If it is still the same, then why breaking his heart?"
22797,I'm sorry! I'm sure something better will come along.
22798,Always be positive :)
22799,"Thats lame, why is work alwasy keeping us from doing what we love."
22800,"yes exactly, in foreign countries they have sometimes mandatory vacation time!"
22801,how old is she ? and yeah work is important to teach her the value of money 
22802,"lol , my dad would make us mow lawns around the neighborhood with his mower, and got us small landscaping gigs to pay for our video games or clothing "
22803,Thats a lot of siblings
22804,I have a lot of cousins too

22824,Hope you you can do this time. 
22825,I don't follow
22826,oh. I never went to college. 
22827,"That must make you feel bad. Being left out by someone you do not expect to, is the worst"
22828,Now you have learned a valuable lesson and know how she really feels toward you
22829,That was harsh lol
22830,I hope you meet somebody then
22831,How is she sneaky?
22832,WHy did she do that?

22851,That sounds so frustrating! I can't stand messy people.
22852,Sounds like it! Are you in a management position or something where you can say something to them?
22853,Sounds like a handful!
22854,That's exciting! First day of school can be stressful.
22855,Oh no did you research what happened for it to be like that?
22856,"I believe you will do better next semester, cheer up buddy"
22857,That's great! I don't like being alone all the time really.

22865,"Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement"

22868,That's awesome. Sounds like you have a great set of friends.
22869,Wow. Well done! How did you do it?
22870,That's a good spot then
22871,"Must be nice, planning anything exciting?"
22872,"Thats fair, so long as you destress and have a good day it doesn't matter what you do right?"
22873,"But you know, if you have some time off might be a good chance to do cleaning 'round the house too."
22874,"'eh, you can never have to much time to get caught up don't you think?"
22875,Oh really? Any reason why not?
22876,Well I am sure you did the best you could with it. 
22877,you should thrash in the waste bin
22878,"oh ok, that good you took safety precaution and others from getting harm by doing that, welldone"

22882,Oh? what happened? did something wake you up?
22883,Oh dear. was it actually someone out there?
22884,Well that's good. I can imagine that would have been frightening]
22885,"don't be too anxious, i trust your team will win"
22886,"haha, i finally meet someone who is like me, game on buddy"
22887,That's a good way to be. No point in being envious all the time.
22888,Me too - it would stop so much hate and bitterness.
22889,"Same here! I haven't picked one up yet, but I loved all the choices they made on it. Some true gems on there."
22890,Right! I had only played the leaked beta from back in the day. That's the one I am most excited about!

22893,"Holy heck, just like right out of the parking lot or what?"
22894,Crap is your insurance going to be able to get you another car or what?
22895,Have you thought about getting a second opinion?
22896,Perhaps you should get different insurance.
22897,that's so sad
22898,All it takes is just a smile and a hello and at least you have one now. Me!
22899,What did she do to fail you?
22900,Did she have the baby?
22901,May be because of the talent they possess!!
22902,"Valid point, Opportunity and skill sets are different "
22903,Really? Business or pleasure?
22904,I'm sure you'll have a great time. I've been a few tiomes but only for work so never seen the sights.

22906,It's so nice to find someone that caring and kind! 
22907,wow interesting
22908,i am sure you wont miss it
22909,I absolutely hate liars.   Are you sure he is really a friend if he lied to you?
22910,"Oh, I see.   I guess its kinda hard to give a friend you have a long time over a lie they told.   Hopefully he/she had a good reason to tell the lie then."
22911,What is the interview for?
22912,That sounds like a great job.
22913,Wow! When do you go?

22946,"i know right, but what can we do, he is the president :)"
22947,You should be arrested for this.
22948,You can report yourself to the police.
22949,I'm not sure everyone agrees. But I'm not American so I can't judge it fairly
22950,If you are very sure about it. I know you will!!
22951,Good for you. I hope you will
22952,Were you expecting them to?
22953,Do you expect them to lose now?

22977,"You will do fine, just relax."
22978,Just remember that it is only one interview. 
22979,No - did you used to text while driving?

22981,was there something wrong with it?
22982,ah well thats true
22983,Are they going to pay for the repair?

23006,oh ok. Just be hopeful that he won't find out
23007,What are you looking to get?
23008,Have you asked you boss?
23009,"Aww, you must have been close to them."
23010,That's hard to lose someone so close to you. At least their memory will live on forever with you.
23011,Maybe he wants you to work the weekend.
23012,That would be a smart move.
23013,I do not like pizza.
23014,I just do not like the sauce and too much bread.
23015,It's not fair - but I suppose the opposite view is that if they make enough money then you don't need the support that otehr people do.
23016,What happened? Was it that bad?
23017,I am sure she didn't like that.
23018,Do you think there are any reasons for that?

23032,Have you considered a hair transplant?
23033,What did she make?
23034,Nice. I love creamy pasta sauces
23035,I know right? The wage gap is pretty big in many cases.
23036,That's a good way of looking at it. It really boggles the mind.
23037,I agree. I'm sure Lakers fans are thrilled!
23038,I don't think they can... yet. But I'm rooting for them anyway.
23039,probably brought back some memories ?
23040,well at least it brought back some good memories!

23048,thats all that matters!
23049,lol. Did the child cry when you took it?
23050,That sounds very interesting.

23056,Wow. What did you do then?
23057,I'm glad you got your money back.
23058,Are you going on vacation?
23059,how bad was it
23060,well there is always the next game!
23061,That's so funny! How did they react when you did that?
23062,I would've been so embarrassed if that was me. At least you've got a funny story to tell people.
23063,"I feel sorry for you, how did you reacted ?"
23064,"This is normal, maybe you should take so time alone to think about how you really fell about the situation. Anger  can make you do things that you will regret later. "
23065,Oh that sound like a lot of fun!! Hope your date ended up being worth all that work.
23066,Confidence is definitely a good things to have when going on a date.   I bet your looked great!
23067,That's good. Great teachers are always needed in this world.
23068,Oh no! Did you hurt yourself bad?
23069,Ugh! Sounds like a problem. Can you find out who it was.
23070,Well its best not to think about it too much. Being angry will not help at all. 
23071,That is so nice of them!
23072,You have some great people at work!
23073,"Oh that can be annoying! I guess in her defence it was a Saturday night? But still, it doesn't take much effort to try to keep the noise down even if you do get in late! I hope you were able to sleep okay. "
23074,"Yeah, like you suggest, it is the little considerations of the other person's needs that can make the difference between an okay and a really good flatmate."
23075,That is so sad.
23076,"Yeah, it will take some for the pain to go away."
23077,Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been terrifying?
23078,I'm glad you're ok
23079,I hope you did well.  Was it difficult?
23080,What was the test over?
23081,"Nice, who did may I ask?"
23082,"I see, you must me so proud of him."
23083,That is cool
23084,Old memories
23085,Awesome! Congratulations to you both! 
23086,I bet. What school is she going to?
23087,Yes I have 3 children
23088,That is so cute! That must make you proud
23089,How did it go? Did you get the job.
23090,Thats so awesome! Was it in the field you wanted?
23091,I bet so.  I can't imagine the difficulty of having to enter a field like that.
23092,"Division 1 is pretty prestigious.  That is very cool, indeed."
23093,"Wow, that must've been awful! How did it all turn out?"
23094,"That sounds really scary, I'm so glad it all turned out fine."
23095,It is so nice to have family be able to back you up in a time of need. Have you been able to catch up yet?
23096,That is wonderful! Great wait to start the upcoming holiday season.
23097,Not cool! Why did you do that?
23098,As you should! You should put back the money that you stole.
23099,"True, I hope you can fight those urges."
23100,That must be so frustrating
23101,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he stops soon.
23102,"Oh my, how did you deal with it? I hope you didnt kill it."
23103,Good on you. The spider is probably thankful for that. It didnt mean to scare you.
23104,I am so sorry that you couldnt go as I can see this was so important to you.  Why did you have to cancel?  Must have been something important come up!
23105,Im sorry you that happend to you.  DO you write books?
23106,Was your name on it?
23107,Have you had issues with this worker before?
23108,"Oh no, what did it say?"
23109,Oh congratulations!  I am so happy for you!
23110,Were you guys married?
23111,Are you serious? That's so childish. I wouldn't let it bother you even though I know thats easier said than done.
23112,Good on you for taking that stand! You must be very proud of yourself 
23113,Its all down to hard work. You deserve to be there. 
23114,"I don't really follow soccer, but it always cool for an underdog to do well."
23115,"I do, too.  Was it their first time to the final?"
23116,That is so cool!
23117,He must be a hard worker!
23118,Do you feel nostalgic about it? If they were good memories.
23119,"Yep, childhood was the best time. Its best to remember these things every now and then."
23120,"Oh, no I""m sorry to hear that. "
23121,I would have done the same thing. Some people have no respect.
23122,Yep those are the most exciting times of life. 
23123,It must have been the best feeling in the world. I am glad you felt it too.
23124,That's great. Is it very nice? I've never been in one of those before. 
23125,How many people does it hold? I have five kids so we have a minivan. 
23126,She must have a lovely voice!
23127,Did you have your alarm on
23128,"Oh wow, I would have thought maybe an animal had gotten in"
23129,Yes one time. I was feeling very hopeful that day. Have you?
23130,"Oh my, sorry to hear that. I am sure there is another job out there for you."
23131,How long were you deployed for. And thank you for your service.
23132,In the medical clinic I bet quiet nights were ok.
23133,"Oh my goodness, I'm sorry! I have a dog and two cats."
23134,"That says a lot about your spouse, when losing your pet is worse. "
23135,Cool!  Getting a new phone is like Christma!
23136,That is a pretty good girlfriend to buy you a new phone.
23137,Oh that's nice of them!  I hope you had a good time at the party!
23138,"Ooo wine, a classy bunch of folk you are!"
23139,I seem you must be quite proud of her for writing on such a subject.
23140,"I agree, high quality work deserves to be read by a broader audience. "
23141,I sure hope so. Why do you think that it will be a good day?
23142,"Yep, it sounds like you are starting your day off on the right foot.  Hope mine goes as well as yours seems to be going so far."
23143,You must have been so impressed. They must have been quite talented.
23144,I wish I could dance like that! Too bad I am only good with computers!
23145,Oh that sounds awful! What did you do?
23146,"At least once it's over, it's over. I would consider other airlines next time! I would also write a complaint letter. "
23147,Are you good at doing flatpack DIY?
23148,That must have been exciting. 
23149,I have. It's definitely awful. It's much like losing a family member.
23150,Oh no! What a horrible thing to happen. I'm sorry to hear that.
23151,"Wow, what a good moment you had. What did you take as your meal?"
23152,"Hahaha hahaha, u can see that you like good things. I missed that with you."
23153,Are you excited about something?
23154,You must be very hungry
23155,Why would you do that?
23156,"Oh wow, Have you ever thought about getting help?"
23157,Yes and it was the worst experience of my life. Have you?
23158,"Oh my, I hope you dont feel scared living alone"
23159,"Oh, what is the race? Sounds like a lot of work!"
23160,I'm sure all the work will be worth it in the end!
23161,Cool! What style of music? 
23162,"Ah I've heard of them, they used to be played on some of the local rock stations. Love a tour t-shirt, always means you might make a friend if you wear it out as other fans are bound to compliment you!"
23163,Ha. Was it geice?
23164,How much did you save?
23165,"Yes, it is terrifying!"
23166,Oh thank goodness it was nothing serious.
23167,That's frustrating. How on earth do you ever get something done?
23168,"It would make sense. If you two are doing the same work job, it's only fair that you evenly divide the housework as well."
23169,"Yes, it's like that all the time for me. "
23170,That is great. I stress myself out over things and I think by doing that it makes things worse.
23171,That is very true. Congratulations on passing your test.
23172,"Oh, goodness. Why did you do such a thing?"
23173,Maybe next time ask her. I hope you pay her back when you can.
23174,Excatly! I would love to know what they spend it all on
23175,"Yup, they cheat the system and then get a huge refund back"
23176,That is terrible. Are you going to take of her?
23177,Why not asking her to move to your home?
23178,"Wow, that sounds intense. What were some of the features it had?"
23179,That does sound scary! I hope you at least enjoyed it a little! 
23180,Yes cruises are awesome. I am sure you will enjoy it.
23181,"Nice, hopefully you many good writers and keep in touch with them!"
23182,you must be excited! 
23183,Nice. Im sure you will have lots of fun doing it.
23184,Do you still talk to the people you went with.
23185,Where did you guys hike? Did you stay over night
23186,Yeah I guess that happens every once in a while.  Something you went through recently?
23187,Oh that's too bad.  I'm assuming you didn't win?
23188,"Not particularly. I wasn't my best self at that time. I suppose who really is, though."
23189,At least you had a good experience. I definitely feel you on the responsibilities part!
23190,You must be really excited for it.
23191,"I agree, there are great ways to buy unique things "
23192,That was nice of them to chip in. It must have felt good that you had someone to help. 
23193,"That's wonderful. It makes all the difference to have people you can trust, especially when you are not feeling well. "
23194,That is nice. Do you like fishing?
23195,I am not a big fan but I go fishing once or twice a year.
23196,That's great. How big is the bonus going to be?
23197,That would help me out quite a bit too!
23198,oh no! Is everything ok? I hope he didnt scare you
23199,Im sure your very worried. Please get help and call the police. I know it can be nervewrecking.
23200,That sounds so good and the perfect way to spend a Sunday.
23201,Are you going to a restaurant or making it yourself?
23202,"Yes, I loved him. Have you?"
23203,It must have been very devastating. But remember him for all the good times.
23204,DId you get tickets? Or getting ready for your licease?
23205,That's awesome! Good luck I'm sure you will do great.
23206,Hopefully it brought back good ones. Were you close to them?
23207,"It's good you have those great memories, though!"
23208,"No, do you have one really sick pet?"
23209,Did you toke her to a vet?
23210,Are you serious? Why wouldn't you pay him back.
23211,"Oh wow, I would have called the police."
23212,Did he do something bad?
23213,It's a tough situation. Did you call him after?
23214,That must have been quite the surprise. 
23215,That is so crazy!
23216,That sounds like a smelly situation.
23217,I hope you get that cleaned up.
23218,Was he a competition eater?
23219,"That's pretty impressive.  I don't think I could manage that.,"
23220,Oh man! you must be sad. have you been bad lately?
23221,I can see how your frustrated. Maybe you can talk to your dad about it. 
23222,A workout program?
23223,I'm a division 1 strength coach.
23224,Its good to feel good about yourself
23225,Its a very confident attitude
23226,No unfortunately. Have you?
23227,"I agree, but I also enjoy my independence. "
23228,"Football, soccer or American football"
23229,Do you play on a professional team?
23230,Oh no! Hopefully you're able to get it all fixed up so you can use it again.
23231,That's quite a bummer!
23232,You must be excited. packing can be hectic. thank god you are organized. 
23233,I agree. You should double check everything to make sure its there. It will help with the worry and anxiousness about it. 
23234,And what was this thing?
23235,"I see, you must be very prepared and talented to compete in such a thing."
23236,"Oh wow! Congrats, I know the process my husband did one. What is your on?"
23237,Yes! What univerisyt it it form
23238,I'm sorry to hear that. Is it a total loss?
23239,Are you going to replace it with a similar year/model?
23240,"Oh my, why can't they just set a time and commit to it?"
23241,"I agree, you should talk to your friend to be more committed to the plans."
23242,Well that sucks but at least it seems like you have a decent support system?
23243,Yeah make sure he knows that!
23244,Did everything went as planned?
23245,I understand. Did you planned it another time?
23246,Wow thats amazing. You must be excited and full of joy!
23247,I can agree how you can feel amazed about. Maybe I will get one so I can be amused just like you. 
23248,That's awful. It's a shame that there's still racist people in 2018!
23249,I would have done the same thing.
23250,"Yes, I litke that too. Do you do that frequently?"
23251,That is awful! You should file a complaint!
23252,I would see if you can escalate it. Talk to the corporate level. 
23253,That sucks. I hope you won't be out of transportation
23254,I bet! They're really cool cars with personality
23255,Oh those definitely sound like some good memories! At least you have some pictures.
23256,I'm sure they would enjoy that quite a bit. They can make memories just like you did.
23257,"I do like them but I haven't been on that many, unfortunately."
23258,Oh no are you alright?
23259,"Well, just never go back to that bar and make all new friends!"
23260,Glad to hear you're feeling better again.  How did you hurt it?
23261,That sucks.  Maybe you need to be a bit more careful until its fully healed.
23262,"I feel for you,but dont take it the hard way,its well"
23263,Thats what you should do
23264,I am sorry you have had back luck. There are some honest people out there. 
23265,"I know, it is true. You just have to try to focus on the good, I suppose. "
23266,That is a really exciting time. You must be so proud.
23267,"I know it's hard when they first go off for college, but it sounds like you raised her well."
23268,Oh that's amazing! Is it a novel? 
23269,How long did it take to write? I always admire the stamina of people who can write a book. 
23270,Oh I'm sorry. I hope you weren't hurt!
23271,That's okay. It happens to everyone! 
23272,"I know it's a blow, but you're only human. Everybody makes mistakes sometimes."
23273,I'm sorry. People can be greedy and unempathetic.
23274,"I'm very happy for you, thank God you could get a job, that's good!"
23275,"I imagine it was very complicated for you when you did not have a job, that happened to me once and I felt very distressed."
23276,That is nice. How many brothers and sisters do you have?
23277,Nice.
23278,Sounds like a real example of learning from the past. sorry you had to go through that. are you better now?
23279,Sounds like youre in a good place. Congratulations!
23280,"That's so funny, I was just looking at the racing schedule yesterday! I love races- if you are talking about horse races. And good memories are the best. "
23281,Did they used to take you? They can be so exciting. 
23282,That's great! That is wonderful luck!
23283,That is wonderful. I hope you have a great time!
23284,So you definitely believe in the old adage: fail to prepare and you prepare to fail?
23285,That sounds like a very sensible philosophy. 
23286,That is so nice of them! What did they bring you?
23287,It sounds delicious! What a good friend. 
23288,That sounds like fun. Did you see any lions?
23289,What else do you see besides lioins?
23290,Oh my! You must have been terrified about it! Did you get it fixed?
23291,Im sure it was very scary for you. Your such a brave person with alot of courage to do so. 
23292,Wow! That is a very expensive car! Did they win the lottery or something?
23293,Yeah. Must be a smooth ride. Lucky guy!
23294,That's not good.  Can't you withhold if they refuse to fix the leak?  I would be really mad! 
23295,That is true about the waste.  I would sue for compensation.  I think the law is on your side regarding this issue.
23296,That is great.  That is a big worry off your shoulders I'm sure.  
23297,I am glad to hear it.  It is a lot more productive to focus on the future than the past.
23298,"That is great. They noticed you because you are doing a good job,"
23299,Good luck with that.
23300,who felt left out? I'm confued?
23301,"That's unfortunate, what did she end up doing?"
23302,What did u do with it afterwards?
23303,"Ok,thats a lot better"
23304,Oh that's not fun! I hope it cleared when you took it out! 
23305,It should have cleared it. I once left bread for two weeks when I went home for winter vacation.
23306,That's so cool!  You must be proud.  I'm terrible at hula hooping
23307,It takes a lot more skill than it appears to!
23308,"Wow, congratulations! Are you nervous?"
23309,Awesome! I hope it goes smoothly and that everything works out great for you!
23310,That's not right! You could probably complain anonymously to the city. 
23311,No. There's definitely something wrong if they won't call a pest control company.
23312,That is nice. How many childrens do you have now?
23313,Congratulations.
23314,That is great. Good job.
23315,"That sounds frustrating, especially if they are inconsiderate and drain you of your funds. They sound kind of entitled."
23316,"Oh wow, that must be embarrassing to deal with. Sounds like they are going through a financial situation, but they should at least talk to you about it since you two are friends."
23317,That's great! I hope you have lots of fun and don't get too bitten by mosquitoes
23318,Don't forget marshmallows!
23319,Wow.  That was uncalled for.  I am sorry to hear about that.  Sounds like she is not someone you would want to date anyway
23320,Do not let it get you down.  There are plenty of people out there who are jerks.
23321,That is terrible. How much did it cost you to fix it?
23322,I understand. Does the grocery store have outside some camera?
23323,Oh NO! It can be annoying especially early mornings at work with no coffee. Hope you stay away!
23324,Sounds frusterating. I hope your next one is more dependable. 
23325,That's not good! I'm assuming they got it back on for you?
23326,I bet it was! That's pretty quick for them to get the power back on actually. In my city it would take a full day.
23327,I be you cant wait! Seeing exotic animals is so exciting!
23328,This will be fun! I bet your full of joy right now!
23329,Im excited for you! Enjoy your day!
23330,That is so scary! Did they catch him?
23331,"I'm pleased to hear that, the security guard sounds brave. Still, it must have been very stressful!"
23332,That sounds awful! Did they fix the order?
23333,I don't think I would ever order from that place again!
23334,"Yikes, I would've been freaking out.  How did you handle it?"
23335,haha I would have run too!
23336,That's so nice... almost a decade!
23337,Very happy for you! To many more!
23338,Awesome first date! Hopefully it goes well for you.
23339,What's your favorite exhibit at the zoo?
23340,Oh my.  I bet you were a nervous wreck.  How did you find your cat?
23341,I am glad he is back home and safe again.  You must be relieved.  
23342,That's awful! Especially in the middle of summer!
23343,Were you able to afford it?
23344,that's amazing 
23345,"I wish I can win like you, I have never won anything before"
23346,You have to give your spot to someone else? What do you mean exactly?
23347,"That's unfortunate but, an emergency is an emergency."
23348,That is great!  Are you nervous about whether or not you will get into med school?
23349,That's good to know!  I would be super excited if I were you!
23350,"That's frustrating!  We have cat scratching posts EVERYWHERE to try to avoid that, but still had to put the sticky tape on the couch to prevent scratching"
23351,"Cats are always getting into things they shouldn't, but I still love them"
23352,What did you do there?
23353,That sounds like a lot of fun! I have never been there
23354,"Awesome, I love breakfast! What did you have?"
23355,"Ah, such a classic breakfast! You can't really go wrong with that."
23356,You must be proud.  Did her team win the game?
23357,Impressive.   Is she looking forward to her next game? 
23358,That is the worst!  Did you have somewhere you needed to be?
23359,That stinks!  Hopefully you are not to mad because of it.  Flat tires happen to the best of us!
23360,That's awesome! It's always good to catch up with an old buddy.
23361,Hopefully he hasn't changed too much and you guys still have similar interests!
23362,That sounds wonderful! I'm sure you
23363,"I am sure you will get there, I meant to say. Don't rush or settle and I am sure you will find something perfect. We bought our first house on Friday!"
23364,Great! What was it about?
23365,Oh how cool! Did you go alone or with your family?
23366,Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. 
23367,"Oh dear. Well next time you are at the store, get two cartons!"
23368,its always good to be prepared. I live in an area that gets hurricanes too.  I've even got a generator. 
23369,Last hurricane I was without power for a whole month. It was miserable. 
23370,Oh no! I have had that happen too! It was very embarrassing!
23371,Yes! Did you notice after a short time?
23372,"Oh, I'm sorry you had that experience. When I was traveling cross-country, I used to FaceTime or Skype friends and family. Would that work for you?"
23373,"That's very true. Another thing I did was find a Trader Joe's or some sort of store and stock up on decent food. Eating alone's no fun, but at least you're safe and nourished!"
23374,I would be so scared to sky dive! How nervous were you before the jump?
23375,I'm glad you didn't pass out! I don't know if I would be able to go through with it.
23376,Congratulations on that. What are her plans now?
23377,I hope she would find one as it seems now the economy is really competitive
23378,That's very sad.  Are you planning on going to syria to help them?
23379,It could end today if everyone came to an agreement.
23380,You must have prepared yourself for this! You will do great!
23381,Great preparation indeed! 
23382,That must have been scary! How are you feeling?
23383,I wouldn't want to be either that sounds terrifying!
23384,That is great.  Was it a scratcher ticket?
23385,I bet.  That was a great surprise I am sure.  Enjoy your vacation!
23386,How frusterating! Have you brought it up to management
23387,I can tell the frusteration in your tone. I would go above your supervisor since nothing has been done. Otherwise you will stay frustrated and angry. 
23388,Wow! I dont know what else you can do. Your at a dead end right now. How annoying!
23389,I know how you feel. I would be furuious. 
23390,I do too! I'm always worried I'm going to throw up!
23391,"I hate when parents don't keep tabs on their kids, especially when they are misbehaving!  What did you do?"
23392,At least you did the right thing and didn't yell at the kid yourself.
23393,I wish you the best of luck! 
23394,"There are many types of loans out there, so hopefully you get one! It will also help you build your credit. "
23395,I bet your anxious to know what happens
23396,Wow! I bet you were so happy for her. I can tell by the joy in your words
23397,Who says unreal things? 
23398,"Yes that happens but, I'm not really understanding the context of your comment..."
23399,Relaxation is very needful
23400,"Yes,its well deserved,very wrlcomed"
23401,Yeah its very nervwrecking. Im anxious as well to know how it turns out. 
23402,Yeah makes me nervous to know what and how it will turn out. Hopefully everything will turn out good for the best. 
23403,That must have taken some preparation! How did you feel afterwards?
23404,I wouldn't be able to move the next day! I hope you rewarded yourself after all of that hard work!
23405,"An ID for glue? What's next, showing ID for buying a greeting card? Sheesh."
23406,I can see that. I guess this is why we can't have nice things.
23407,"Know the feeling. I had one job where I spent all day either playing cards or working online, just to relieve the boredom!"
23408,"Is there any way you can do something else during down time, or do you have to be available immediately if it gets busy?"
23409,I'm sorry. What type of job do you do?
23410,Me too. My phone was a help to play online games if I was totally losing it! And sneaking out for a walk helped too!
23411,WHOA! That's awesome! I've never won anything in my life lol
23412,I bet! What did you do with all the money?
23413,Oh no!  Did you ever find him again?
23414,I am sorry to hear that.  Maybe he will find his way back home some day.
23415,Why did you lose contact? What happened?
23416,"That's very sad, I'm sorry to hear that"
23417,Why alone
23418,So where did you sped the time alone?
23419,That sounds like fun Who are you going with?
23420,I am sure you will enjoy it. 
23421,Oh that sounds like fun! What types of food do you cook?
23422,Food always makes the party! 
23423,Wow! How content you must feel about it!
23424,That must have made you feel happy! I can tell!
23425,"I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing family can be, and is, very tough."
23426,That's all you really can do. I hope you find that you heal in time.
23427,The irony that the internet bill could not be paid online is kind of funny.  But I can see how that would be a let down and inconvenient.
23428,That is good.  I like to pay most of my bills online too
23429,"Whew, you're braver than I am."
23430,I hope it all goes okay for you. Trust your instincts about doing it or not.
23431,"Really, what happened?"
23432,"Wow, I bet that was pretty interesting to look through and remember those days gone by.  I hope the reminiscing was all good memories."
23433,I'm sure that is definitely not true. What makes you think that?
23434,Those type of people are really difficult to deal with. I hope he is open to change.
23435,Being anxious is normal! Be yourself and you will be just fine!
23436,You will be fine! Dont overthink. Just make it a happy day. 
23437,Im sorry to hear that! Are they trying to shame or embarrass you about something. 
23438,You seem like a trusting guy. there are not too many of those these days
23439,Were you embarrassed or what happend?
23440,I know! It can be sentimental at times! You will grow along with them. Enjoy the ride
23441,he didn't punish you... he punished himself! That makes no sense 
23442,That's great. What do you have going on?
23443,Well that's good to hear!
23444,Oh no that's terrible! I'm sorry you had to go through that. Pets are our family.
23445,I'm sorry. I hope memories of your dog bring you comfort.
23446,Do you like it ?
23447,"Well, if you don't, you won't be the only one."
23448,Oh no that's bad. Did she take any medicine?
23449,"Hmm maybe try some propolis. That works for me, and I have horrible allergies."
23450,Really? That was cool
23451,That is kind of them
23452,"Thats so good,am happy for you"
23453,"Wao,you are so favoured,are u back already?"
23454,Did you feel bad about it?
23455,Sometimes we do things that we don't regret at the moment but do later on down the road.
23456,Oh no - what happened?
23457,We've lost several with our girls over the  years.  I understand.
23458,Hopefully you do good on those and the doctor clears you.
23459,You will be okay and get better.
23460,What was a snake doing there?
23461,I don't like snakes either 
23462,what? why would she say that? that's mean
23463,like what? you think she wanna do something bad to you or your brother?
23464,You don't like reading alone? 
23465,"Yes, I can understand that. I'm sorry you don't have anyone to read with. Hopefully that will change in the near future."
23466,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, you seem upset about it."
23467,"Oh wow, I misunderstood what cheating meant in this context. You can always bounce back and redeem your diet."
23468,There will surely be maggots on that when you get home.
23469,I'll never go to your house in that shape.
23470,I agree!  Especially the green ones.
23471,My husband always says alcohol makes them acceptable.  lol
23472,I would have cried for hours.
23473,"I hate spiders and frogs, and snakes."
23474,I love pizza!  What is you favorite type?
23475,"Why do you say that?  It can't be that bad for you, right?"
23476,I try to eat the most junk food possible.
23477,I think i will most likely die before i am thirty.
23478,Oh no that is terrible. I've had that happen once. Did you find him?
23479,I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets are just like family.
23480,Did the vet fix the dog?
23481,"My dog is also like family to me, so i understand."
23482,That's funny! I agree and it's worse when they aren't your kids.
23483,"To each their own. I have 3 and to be honest, I'm glad they are getting older. Babies suck."
23484,I would have had a great time eating your food.
23485,"I do not eat chicken, but i would have loved the brisket!"
23486,"I agree, that was a really scary one! I think it was much creepier than average horror movies."
23487,How long did it take you to not be scared around your own apartment anymore?
23488,"Wow, it really stuck with you a long time."
23489,Sounds like a good night. What movie was it?
23490,That's a perfect way to end the day.
23491,That happens more often that you might think. Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's any good.
23492,"Yep, probably would have been happier at some hometown diner."
23493,"Oh yeah, I hate that too. It's so inconvenient to be closed when people have time to go there."
23494,I agree. It's about time society caught up.
23495,"I'm glad you're ok! It's Sunday, I'm ok too!"
23496,Totally. I'm not working today. How about you?
23497,yea have fun
23498,ok you have a greate time enjoy
23499,Indeed. Are you religious then?
23500,"I was raised in a presbyterian church in Scotland, but haven't been to church in a while. Perhaps I should go. Which church do you attend?"
23501,i bet! I wanna go on vacation too! it's been a while. where are you guys going?
23502,I've been to florida once. I went to universal and adventure island parks. so much fun! I hope you guys enjoy your time there
23503,Wow - can you ask them to tone it down at all?  That would drive me crazy!
23504,"That is just crazy, they should not disrupt the complex like that."
23505,that's good to have friends you can count on! what kind of party are you having?
23506,nice! Happy belated birthday :) I hope you had a wonderful time with your friends
23507,That always makes it a great night when your team wins!
23508,You should have placed a bet since you were so confident. You could have won a bundle.
23509,It is always good to have a friend who can take your hand in times of need. I wish I had more of that type of friends
23510,Will you also have his back?
23511,I need to start saving more money honestly.
23512,I like to spend money on food alot.
23513,"Ugh, I absolutely hate it when that happens!  "
23514,It's so frustrating!  My dog is elderly so it's been happening more.
23515,That must be very painful for both him and you.
23516,That sounds better than I had thought.
23517,That is not good.  Why do you think it won't come?
23518,That is true.  I have lost packages in the past.
23519,I wish i could afford a vacation like that.
23520,One day i'll try one of those.
23521,Yes he will. 
23522,He's a beautiful reason to get up
23523,Is she still with you?
23524,She will always be with you.
23525,Maybe they just have better taste?
23526,"You can get good looks for cheap! Look at second hand clothes, I've bought lots of designer stuff used."
23527,I would have cried right there.
23528,I can barely walk much less imagine that.
23529,So what do you have for example ?
23530,"Oh, that must be pleasant to remember the good days with."
23531,why is that exactly?
23532,I try to forget about how bad it really all is.
23533,"Ok,how do u combine it?"
23534,"Wao,thats good,it s so refreshing"
23535,"I am very confused, i hope one day they will."
23536,Keep talking to them and they will make sure you go first.
23537,"That must be very hard for you all, but I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. What's the exam for?"
23538,"That's fantastic news! Congratulations to all of you - him for working so hard and passing, and you for being so patient and understanding."
23539,Good for you. Is it truly your first time flying on a plane?
23540,One advice. Don't freak out when the plane go through some turbulence. It is normal and will only last for couple of minutes
23541,Ouch!  That is not good!  Think of the bright side though.  Better opportunities may present themselves to you!
23542,Don't think that way!  There is always something to look forward to!
23543,Was your dog ok? I hope it didn't run away.
23544,That is awful and I bet your husband feels really bad. I would be really mad though.
23545,you mean you stole it or they gave it to you?
23546,that's not good! That's stealing. if you needed money you should've just asked them for it. You need to tell them what you did
23547,I would have screamed.
23548,You should have checked the entire house!
23549,"Wow, what a show off. Would you say they are nicer by a large margin?"
23550,"Okay I see your point, I think they make really eye catching shoes."
23551,I'm really sorry for your loss. At least they still live on through your memories.
23552,That's really awesome. they sound like amazing people. 
23553," i don't think i know who Rodney Dangerfield is but hey, good for you! it's awesome when people have a good sense of humor"
23554,I need to google him. I've never even heard that phrase lol
23555,That's cool. Do you have a photo album you keep them in?
23556,Oh ok that's a good idea.
23557,The gym always hurts my body when i go.
23558,I hate that feeling so much.
23559,"Well, it's time for a wash then."
23560,"Come on, you can do it."
23561,"Summer flys by, i hope winter lasts a long time."
23562,The winter is where i spread my wings and grow.
23563,"Seems like you were well prepared, did you pass?"
23564,That's a very complicated way to say November.
23565,DId you get out and kick them?
23566,I have bad road rage.
23567,i am looking forward to trying to get pregnant by the end of the year
23568,really? we have been trying for 6 years so it's been difficult
23569,I do not think that I want kids.
23570,well i am sure many people do not want to have kids.
23571,i'm sorry. i know how that feels.
23572,your previous conversation. no worries. I love Disney haven't been in 10 years but i love it
23573,How come what do you mean?
23574,Confusion runs deep in me.
23575,That's really great for you! Some people say that praying helps solve anything
23576,That's very true!
23577,I'll always talk to you.
23578,I'll always be for you.
23579,Do you still have the cat?
23580,That's great to hear! I'm glad you kept him around!
23581,i hate when that happens! I stub my toes all the time i'm surprised i didn't break none of them yet
23582,good thing is they heal pretty fast and you don't need a cast or anything like that
23583,"I wish you the best of luck, study hard and you'll do well!"
23584,"I remember Calc II, it can be difficult, but if you practice it's not so bad."
23585,Good for you. What class was it?
23586,I am not really good at chemical science and had much difficulties during high school. Enjoy your moment. You deserved it
23587,that sounds amazing. i haven't seen my family in almost 2 years
23588,i do but they wont come visit and i can't afford to go visit
23589,I'm sorry to hear that. Why don't you join some groups so you can meet some new people. 
23590,Sometimes you just have to reach out to people. Oftentimes other people are feeling the same way and you don't even realize it. 
23591,What happened to cause the change.
23592,"Oh, okay. Take good care of him and he'll always love you."
23593,"That is great, I""m sure you've worked very hard for it."
23594,I'm so glad they are recognizing you for all your efforts.  It feels so nice to be commended for a job well done.
23595,"Heck yeah! I loved that game on the n64, we used to play it all the time in college!"
23596,"I'll be sure to check this out! My brother has a switch I can ""borrow""!"
23597,"That sounds like a lot of fun, will you be cooking stuff too?"
23598,"Sounds like a wonderful day-long event, hope you enjoy it!"
23599,That sounds like a wonderful time. I wish I had the time for that!
23600,That's very true. 
23601,I would feel guilty too if I was in your shoes.  Did you feel bad because you stole or bad because you got caught?
23602,Then why did you do it?
23603,That is a great attitude to have and wonderful that you are so supportive of them.
23604,"Some people get jealous when other people are doing well, so you are truely a good friend"
23605,That's awesome! I can say that it's agreat feeling to graduate. 
23606,"Yeah, but now you can go out and make your mark in the real world. "
23607,"I bet, I get home sickness even if I'm gone a couple day.  I bet they are happy to see you as well!"
23608,Hope you guys celebrate and eat something good for dinner tonight!
23609,That's awesome does she live far away or just super busy all the time?
23610,Are you going to dinner together or something? 
23611,Oh? And hopefully they did not!
23612,"Yeah, I can see that! Not much you can do though to prevent it. Except for living as healthy as possible!"
23613,"Wow, how exciting. Are you going to go?"
23614,"You can get the pills, the patch or that bracelet to help."
23615,That is great! What game did you play? Was it fun?
23616,What do you do in that game?
23617,That is nice.  Was the quilt passed down to you from her?
23618,That is great to keep things that remind us of our loved ones
23619,I know that nostalgic feeling. Time really flies.
23620,"Absolutely, that makes me want to go look at some pictures."
23621,Oh that sounds disgusting. Have you talked to him about it?
23622,"Oh no! I would be trying to find another place if I were you, or tell him to find one!"
23623,That must be stressful! \
23624,Well if you study hard I'm sure you will do fine. 
23625,I can understand. Ultimately you don't have to be rich to have a kid though
23626,"True. Well, whatever you decide to do I wish you the best!"
23627,That is very irresponsible from your side. It is never wise to spend your hard earned money on such leisure
23628,That is the illusion of winning when in reality you are expected to lose
23629,I love physics!
23630,"No, that is normal."
23631,I didn't go to the gym forever! I know how you feel though
23632,i know. I had an anxiety when i first started coming to the gym. I didn't know how to use a couple of machines so i stayed on tradmill the whole time
23633,"Oh no, when did this happen? Do you think you'll find him?"
23634,"That's sad, I'm sorry to hear that!"
23635,My family was over all weekend and we had a blast.
23636,My family is my whole world.
23637,Hopefully you don't have to go through anything like that again.
23638,That's terrible of them! I would sit with you!
23639,Hey that really stinks. I hope that you can find someone to sit with you.
23640,What was in there?!
23641,That's hilarious! They sure do! My kids look forward to them!
23642,That's Awesome. Did you change anything lately?
23643,Oh that is awesome. What motivates you?
23644,OH no! Can you return it?
23645,"Yeah , sometimes stuff looks way better on the model."
23646,It's always nice to look back on old memories
23647,Childhood was a lot easier
23648,I agree mothers are great. I appreciate mine as well.
23649,They make so many sacrifices for us. I love to spoil mine on Mother's Day.
23650,Hmmm yeah I maybe would consider moving out. 
23651,Maybe you should have someone go down with you. Safety in numbers?
23652,I am so sorry to hear that. I know what that is like unfortunately.
23653,"Yes definitely. My thoughts are with you, I hope he still has many years left."
23654,"Oh, I love to read as well.  Especially during a rain next to a window."
23655,It can! The quiet can be so calming
23656,When did you feel prepared?
23657,What were you prepared for?
23658,ohh its very seek
23659,its very critical situvation
23660,wow this sounds like a crazy situation.
23661,"wow, well I'm glad this all seemed to work out for you!"
23662,"thats cool, dont need a diaper rash"
23663,"thats usually what happens, lol. "
23664,Awesome! What was the name of the book?
23665,Didn't they make a movie from that book?
23666,You mean new house? Did you find it for sale really cheap?
23667,"Hmm, perhaps it means something really bad happened there. I would give the Ghostbusters a call."
23668,That is very true! I dono't understand why people doe that!
23669,Yeah they deserve it!
23670,Awesome! Are you going alone?
23671,That's great! Is it for vacation?
23672,"I'm not familiar with the hot light term, what does that mean exactly?"
23673,"Oh that's a neat feature, I'm sure they taste better when they're fresh."
23674,It's great to be able to have that trust and bond. Did everything go well?
23675,"That's good to hear, all well that ends well."
23676,On no! Did you ever tell her?
23677,Do you think she will ever give you a second chance? 
23678,That is so sad. I hope it wasn't too hard for him.
23679,Losing a pet is tough for everyone. I completely understand the grief.
23680,Aww man yeah we get really attached to our pets huh?)
23681,I'm sure she is.  All the fish flakes she can eat.
23682,That is horrible.  What is the treatment for it?
23683,I wish your cat the best.  I know it must be hard
23684,"Oh cool, is it for work or fun?"
23685,You sound really well prepared!
23686,How badly did you slip up? You're allowed cheat days
23687,That's quite a big slip up... I'm not even sure how you'd do that.
23688,Yeah I like looking at my old pictures too!
23689,Yeah it is good to think about the good ol' days!
23690,"Wow, you must be euphoric!"
23691,How lucky!  Don't get crazy though.  invest form the future.
23692,That's crazy. Where did it come from?
23693,Strange the receptionist did that. I bet everyone wanted to pet the puppy!
23694,That's exciting. When is it?
23695,Christmas day huh? What made you decide that?
23696,"dont understand you,were you chased by a hurricane?"
23697,"ok ,so what was the time frame of evacuation?"
23698,That is annoying!  Is someone in your house not doing there job cleaning after themselves.
23699,That is no good.  What are you going to do about it?
23700,How nice of them. My oldest is paying her own way. I wish I was in a situation that I could help her more.
23701,I'm sure it was a huge relief not having to worry about loans. I'm still dealing with mine and I graduated in 2008.
23702,oh my goodness that is horrible!
23703,I am sure it does.  I am really sorry about all of that.
23704,This happened to us last spring. Our dog was 8 years old. It can be a very emotional time but it gets better over time. Have you thought about creating a memorial for him? Maybe a photo collage to hang.
23705,I know how you feel. Just know that it gets better and try to think about the great life he had because of you and your love!
23706,that is great are you on a business journey or Holiday 
23707,i will be staying at home 
23708,That sounds very lonely and sad.
23709,We watch the twilight zone too on new years. What is bomb food ?
23710,"I see. I usually reflect a lot on new years, thinking of the past, and looking to the future."
23711,"nice , just relaxing after a long week that sounds perfect honestly"
23712,"right it would be awesome to have 3 days off, but this is the real world "
23713,you need not to be afraid as long as you've prepared very well
23714,"yes, i believe you are"
23715,That is great news! I'm sure you are excited! Congratulations to you two!
23716,I bet you two will have a long and great marriage!
23717,You make it out of wood or is it one of those aluminum ones?
23718,Good for you.  There's nothing quite like the sense of pride assocaited with building something!
23719,"Ah, I'm sorry to hear that, is it for work or something else?"
23720,"That does suck, well maybe you guys can work something out to see each other every so often."
23721,"I hope so, is your car in bad shape?"
23722,"Just a month? Not that long to wait, but better be careful in the meantime so you won't be left somewhere far from help."
23723,"Wow, heard that is a tough test, good luck and I'm sure you are prepared."
23724,"Good luck, and a future congratulations on killing it!"
23725,That's awful. Where's she staying now ?
23726,I'm glad she's got you to look after her.
23727,That sounds so relaxing!
23728,I hope you enjoy it!
23729,"That's awesome, reading is my favorite past time as well.  What book?"
23730,"Oh I've read that, That is a really good book, I even enjoyed the movie as well."
23731,Maybe you should talk with him about how you feel?
23732,Well at least you can say you tried. Sometimes teenagers need to figure it out on their own.
23733,"That is so, so sad. Are they going to separate or is there a chance that he can change his ways and earn her trust again?"
23734,"It is very difficult, but I've see marriages recover from that position - but it takes years to build up that trust again properly. I wish them all the best"
23735,"Oh gross, you should bail quick if you see a kid getting sick, so that you won't be around to help clean it up."
23736,"I'm sorry, maybe a nose plug would come in handy"
23737,"as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently , but i was busy at work too he understood "
23738,"we cant win them all , but work always comes first "
23739,How'd it taste? And what kind of cake was it?
23740,"Well, look at the bright side - you got a cake for the anniversary of you becoming a parent to your daughter, and your daughter still gets cake.  I kinda think everyone wins there!"
23741,That sounds really great! What movie are you going to see?
23742,It really is! I hope that you have a good time!
23743,"That's pretty scummy, has he always been like that?"
23744,You should have a talk with him and let him know how you feel.
23745,No way! that's gross
23746,I hope they at least fixed it for you!
23747,That sounds so fun!
23748,That is great! I'm sure they will enjoy it like you did!
23749,Very good. You must be handy around the house - I'm useless! Lanais are wonderful - and necessary in many places!
23750,Smart move. Wish I could do stuff like that. You should be very proud of yourself :)
23751,I think you should take the rest of the day of and relax in your new lanai. You can sit and bask in the glory of a job well done!
23752,Thats awesome are you having it ?
23753,Uh oh. What happened?
23754,That was a sweet surprise. Is everything okay now?
23755,"Don't think that well! As long as you are prepared, you will do great!"
23756,"Ah, yeah, I struggled with that too, but if you try hard enough you will get through it."
23757,That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you live in the country?
23758,"Awesome, you will have a blast. Make sure to stay safe."
23759,That is adorable! I bet you were proud!
23760,Awww! That's great!
23761,Oh no I hope she's ok!?
23762,Lol pour water on it next time. Always does the trick!
23763,I'm not suprised. I always did that as a kid.
23764,Yeah the only way he will learn is if he figures it out by himself. 
23765,"Awww, that's sweet! He was lucky to find such a great partner!"
23766,Oh no! You can't do that to your friend! You'll find the right single person in time!
23767,The perfect person for you will come soon enough
23768,Stay positive!
23769,Yum! What type of food was it?
23770,I love burgers! You're making me hungry!
23771,I would be upset too. You need to sit down and talk to him about it
23772,you're a good parent. Keep up a good work
23773,"Please call the police,its called noise abuse"
23774,Thats what you have to put up with with the wrong neighbors
23775,"Aw, can't fit any classes into your schedule?"
23776,"Oh congratulations, you must be smart!"
23777,"Aw, That's awesome.  The training paid off and I bet she feels really proud!"
23778,"Haha, I bet, when she becomes a pro you can say you've been her fan since day one!"
23779,I hope you got a warranty on it. New cars should not have issues for a while.
23780,Well perhaps you got a lemon. I would ask for a new car if it happens again.
23781,Oh no! I hope that you are getting better!
23782,That's awesome that you have such a great partner! 
23783,Isn't it fun to think of times like that. When you were free of most responsibilites?
23784,What year did you graduate?
23785,That is great that they are willing and able to help.
23786,I bet that was such a relief for you guys!
23787,Oh wow I bet you were really proud?
23788,I'm sure he will! Best of luck to him!
23789,"That's the worst, when they take forever.. Have you called them up?"
23790,"Yeah, I understand, they should at least give you a discount!"
23791,I feel jealous I didn't get the artistic genes my brother got lol
23792,Probably! Makes me feel better now lol
23793,That's really awesome! You are a really lucky person!
23794,That's so awesome. I wish my godmother did that!
23795,That is awesome. I am sure she will do great.
23796,And think one day she may be able to save your life haha.
23797,"Oh i can relate, that happened to me with UberEats a couple days ago. Its so frustrating!"
23798,"Yeah its the worst when they don't own up to it, makes me want to use the competitors service just to spite them. Very annoying."
23799,Oh no! At least you noticed now
23800,Yes and also explain to them you noticed you were doing it. They'll understand
23801,How many slices did you ate?
23802,"That's a lot for anyone, lol"
23803,I've done this before! It can be very nostalgic to see old friends that you haven't seen in awhile. Did it bring back any particular memories?
23804,You could always make a collage with your favorite pictures! 
23805,"I sort of have. I worked like crazy to get a work visa for the US, so I could be with the person I wanted to spend my life with. It paid off, so I can kind of understand what you're saying."
23806,"Scotland. It's quite a process getting in here, despite what some people try to tell you! What happened with you?"
23807,Well stay focused and work hard! You got this!
23808,Maybe you could get out and meet some new people.
23809,Yeah arcades are pretty sweet. I like that some of them have bars in them now. 
23810,I'm not surprised. It also helps me play better!
23811,Congratulations and I'm sure you will do fine.  Do you think you will enjoy doing it?
23812,"It'll be a good experience at the very least, good luck!"
23813,that is sad. why would he gossip! that's so low
23814,That could be so hard on you
23815,Just keep your mind occupied with other important stuff
23816,Congrats! Is this your first child?
23817,I think you will do fine! You will be in love at first sight for your!
23818,"Congratulations, she must be a quick one, I was always the slow one at the back of the pack."
23819,"Wow, that's impressive, she might get a scholarship one day!"
23820,"I imagine, that must be so awful. Have you had that before?"
23821,I hope the doctor can help you get the pain away!
23822,"Aw, that's sweet, I'm glad you love her so much!"
23823,"That's good, no body should ever cheat in my opinion!  At least end the relationship first."
23824,Oh my god. That's aweful!
23825,Well he sounds really irresponsible. I would make him pay for the damages. 
23826,"Tell me about it, they have to be in my top 5 things I hate the most."
23827,Plus they are so small it's harder to kill them for me. Flies are larger so I have an easier time getting rid of them.
23828,"Uggh, what a buzzkill."
23829,I'd say that is definitely true for you now.
23830,ok and how does that work
23831,thats awesome but would you?
23832,"Ok ,why would you do that?"
23833,Call her back then since you miss her like crazy
23834,No way! That's sad for the man but gross for you
23835,Wow that is disgusting
23836,That's awesome! Where are you vacationing to?
23837,I love the beach! I'm sure you'll have a great time there.
23838,I hate spiders! Especially if you know theres one in the room where you are sleeping!
23839,"Haha sorry, I've been in that position and chose to sleep on the couch because of it!"
23840,That's really great that you have such a great partner like her!
23841,I would be the same without my wife too!
23842,"Aw, dang, sounds like he is battling it very well though!"
23843,"Ouch, I'm very sorry for your loss! You did your best, and I'm sure he is in heaven now looking over you!"
23844,I can definitely understand how you would be worried about that.  I think I'd have to decline - LOL!  You are a good person for being willing to meet with him.
23845,"Well, yes if there is a child involved, then you've got to deal with him at some point.  I hope it goes well for you though."
23846,"I've never watched a single full star wars movie, just bits and pieces haha"
23847,"Thanks, I will look into it! Maybe get caught up before the new movie comes out!"
23848,You must have been surprised! Were you happy about it?
23849,Sounds great!  What a good idea your mom had!
23850,No way! That must have smelled so bad
23851,I can imagine eww
23852,"Aww man sorry for your loss, those are the worst, its like losing your best friend. I hope he passed away peacefully and happy."
23853,"Aww shoot, I lost a dog when i was little in a very tragic way as well. I miss that big guy, he was like a brother to me. Hope you're doing good now, he's in a good place."
23854,It's okay! A cheat weekend every now and then can be well deserved when on a diet! Start right now eating healthy again! You can do it!
23855,That's awesome! Good luck with your diet!
23856,Congratulation!  It is really smart to be as prepared as possible!  This baby will change your world!
23857,That is good.  It will make you quite happy.  I couldn't imagine life without my kid now!
23858,"Ouch! That's the worst, are they pretty damaged?"
23859,"Oh well, shake it off and keep flaunting that nice car! :)"
23860,Good for you! It's always so satisfying to look back and see how much you've achieved.
23861,Nothing wrong with sleep - along with food it's what keeps us going! How many hours do you work?
23862,"Yum, what is she cooking?"
23863,"Yum that sounds delicious! I'm a vegetarian as well, I will have to look into the recipe for that!"
23864,Oh wow. No I've never had to deal with that before. I hope your husband is ok!
23865,That's awesome that you had such a great support network to help you. 
23866,Umm..did you MEAN to kick it?
23867,They are kinda like rats with wings.
23868,"Aw, poor fellow, well I'm sure he was close to his home."
23869,"There's always next time, forgive yourself and help the next pupper you see!"
23870,"Oh you must be so sad, I know I would be if that had happened to me."
23871,That is great! I have a dog that I adopted in similar circumstances. 
23872,"Oh god no, my heart would be racing. Were you scared?"
23873,"Damn, i can't imagine ever going through that. I hope it was something minor and didn't affect you too much."
23874,"Wow that intense, we all make mistakes though hope youre doing better!"
23875,Sounds great! Yes relaxing time is always needed and appreciated.
23876,Hope you enjoy your week off! Sounds like you earned it :)
23877,"I take the bus so I don't have to deal with the traffic, but man that sounds like it would really stink"
23878,Wow he sounds like jerk!
23879,"I used to enjoy doing that with my grandmother, she'd tell me all about when my dad was little.  I love old stories like that."
23880,What an interesting field - my husband would love to say that was his profession!
23881,"oh oh, so now you don't know where your enemy is hiding.  Sounds scary."
23882,"How annoying, but would be wise imagine it jumping on you while you sleep."
23883,"What kind of chair is it? A lounging chair, or maybe  a computer desk chair?"
23884,"Oooh, that'll be really good. It aught to be really comfortable too."
23885,"Sweet!, must be a really big pool if you have to wait until next summer. "
23886,"Oh yeah, gets too cold. I've always wanted one of those concrete pools. I'm stuck with an above ground one for now until i get enough money for one. "
23887,So what would you do to halt that?
23888,Thats thoughtful!\
23889,"That's not good, do you think he will pay you?"
23890,"You can take out a loan, but good luck, I hope you get it!"
23891,And no one told you about it?  Maybe no one noticed it at all?
23892,That is horrible!  I hope they realize that their reaction was not exactly nice.
23893,Oh my! I hope is ok!
23894,Yeah that is a really suckying thing to do to you. 
23895,So how does he afford such luxury?
23896,"Ok ,he shouldn't have stopped! Other kids deserves it too"
23897,How so?
23898,Hard work usually pays off. Which exams are you taking?
23899,I hope she recovers soon. I know it is hard to see loved ones sick.
23900,That is good to hear. I am sure she will be fine.
23901,Good for you! You are a lucky person!
23902,That's great! I'm a bit jealous.
23903,"Yeah i've been through that feeling before, I had a show that was going to get cancelled but thankfully it got saved by another company. What show was yours?"
23904,"Oh i've heard of that show, never got around to seeing it though. That sucks!"
23905,That's really great. I'm happy for you.
23906,"Congratulations, it sounds like you've really made it. I envy you."
23907,I'm sorry to hear that you couldn't finish it! What couldn't you finish?
23908,Hey you are being too hard on yourself. I'm sure your boss would prefer it done well and not rushed. 
23909,Yes! I always cried when I watched it as a child.
23910,Yes! My kids cried too 
23911,Oh I love the thrill of a good roller coaster.
23912,It's definitely not for everyone. You either love them or you don't.
23913,I could imagine. Dogs are amazing.
23914,Definitely. Hold on to those.
23915,"Thats great, family comes first over everything!"
23916,"Yep, they're always there for you no matter what"
23917,Awe! Really I was planning on seeing it this weekend. 
23918,Really? What was the main disappointment? 
23919,"Thats nice,hope you will host them well?"
23920,Uhmmnn! never knew you had room mates
23921,What type of trip are you planning?
23922,"Oh don't stress it, i've done that so many times. It happens"
23923,"Yeah, or buy pants without zippers. But don't stress it, i'm sure whoever saw it didn't really mind!"
23924,Oh that sounds exciting. I've always wanted to go.
23925,I've flown but not much and never left the country either. I hope y'all have fun :)
23926,There's some decent benefits to doing things the old way. 
23927,Got anything specific you like to be traditional about?
23928,"Yes, I'm a picky eater."
23929,"Yes, I hate that. I usually end up going back and getting some more just for me."
23930,"Thats awesome, i cant imagine not having AC in this hot florida weather!"
23931,Yeah the heat isn't as bad but mix it with humidity and you've got the worst possible combination. Its terrible!
23932,That sounds like such a surprise. Does he have a disability that keeps him at home?
23933,That's great to hear! My papa is getting older too. It's nice to be able to spend time with him.
23934,"Oh awesome, what part of Florida?"
23935,Oh that sounds really fun and I bet she will love it all. I'm jealous :)
23936,"wow ,try next time!"
23937,"well, thats how fate would have it"
23938,I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?
23939,I know how frustrating it can be when we receive so an awful service.  They should train people to do a better job.
23940,That is so sad. I know how it feels to lose a pet.
23941,I lost a goldfish once. She was my best friend.
23942,Bet you'll be glad to have some free time on your hands at last.
23943,lol - yeah I can relate. Kids can be a real handful when they don't have structure - as in during the summer months.
23944,Okay now I understand... COMPLETELY! I deal with that daily! I am ready to give up on ever cleaning again.
23945,That sounds rather convenient. Are you giving up anything for that?
23946,"If it's too traumatic for him, you can always try to put him back."
23947,Oh my goodness! What did you do? I bet your heart was racing!
23948,"hahaha that sounds about how I would have reacted! I once saw my shadow on the blinds in my living room. I sat there frozen thinking someone was outside. Then, I moved and the shadow did too!"
23949,"Thats awesome, i dont have kids yet but i was also looking through some old school photos of me and my friends. Such innocent times."
23950,"Yes it does, I wish her the best! early adulthood is the best time!"
23951,I agree and it's full of commercials no one wants to see.
23952,"Oh yes, I know what you are saying. I've never been into GOT but I've heard it's good. "
23953,I would be so mad. I can't believe people can do that and sleep at night
23954,I hope so too. That is just not right. They could have left a note at least.
23955,"wow! love birds,how nice,so where exactly are you headed?"
23956,"Well,it would be a whole new experience for you"
23957,How annoying! Did she fix it fast?
23958,That would be frustrating. Did it get corrected? Did you still have to pay?
23959,"im sorry thats awful, i hope he makes a full recovery"
23960,i can only imagine!
23961,"That's cool, what is the position?"
23962,"Don't wish, demonstrate. Do something that reflects what type of supervisor you're going to be. People love previews."
23963,Give me an example?
23964,I get it. It does seem like they are always coming out with another version.
23965,"Oh, that's too bad. Perhaps have the picnic indoors? It wouldn't be the same, but at least you could share food and have a laugh!"
23966,"I can imagine. That's the problem with planning outside events - we can't dictate the weather. You should try planning something outdoors in Scotland, where I'm from - soggy food every time!!"
23967,Who has cancer? Someone you know?
23968,Well I am no cancer expert. Probably should get a second opinion from a doctor.
23969,"LoL....no sweetie, I'm sure it's your dog again. Didn't the same thing happen last month?"
23970,Oh sorry about that I thought you had a dog. Well then maybe the noise the some type of critter. Have you checked under the bed today?
23971,I remember that. A lot of people were grossed out and didn't want to do it. Were your girls one of them?
23972,"Yea, it tends to be kinda gross. My teacher had us dissect fish as well and I prefere that much more for some reason"
23973,I sure hope they are trustworthy.
23974,It is so good to have someone that is trustworthy no matter what you tell them.  I'm glad you have a friend like that.
23975,"I'm so sorry to hear that, my girlfriend's cat is going through the same thing right now. It can't be easy."
23976,That's so sad... The best thing you can do is spend lots of time with her and make every minute count. I wish you all the best.
23977,Usually people want someone in their life. I guess that takes staying away from others.
23978,Some people prefer to be alone. Whatever makes them happy I suppose.
23979,I would laugh so hard if that was me seeing my dog do that
23980,I hope you can share it on social media so that the whole world can share in the fun :)
23981,"i do too, its a shame"
23982,"i am too, i hope we can make a change before it is too late"
23983,Lucky for you! I'm at work right now! Haha!
23984,"No, its fine! Enjoy your day off, I definitely would if I were you!"
23985,"Oh, that's awful. Were you okay, or did you have to go to the hospital?"
23986,"That sounds terrifying! I've never been in a car accident, and sure wouldn't like to be in one."
23987,oh wow did it bring back memories?
23988,That is so fun!  Memories are always a wonderful thing to have
23989,Well it is good to be thankful. We have to remember all the little things.
23990,"It is good to appreciate what we have, not opine for what we don't have."
23991,"I hope you got it on camera, I would if i was in your shoeas"
23992,"Nice, buddy he will thank you for it when he grows up"
23993,Awww good for him! 
23994,I'm glad he's getting better with his speech and I hope he continues to improve!
23995,I hate when that happens. I'm so bad with directions.
23996,What did you end up doing?
23997,"I depend so heavily on my GPS, i don't know what i would have done"
23998,Oh that's great news. I bet he is having lots of fun.
23999,That's great. Some people can go through college and still don't know what they want to do.
24000,That's a ton of oysters! I don't think I've even ever eaten one oyster. What's a mixed plate? 
24001,Hmm it's funny how seasonings and spices really alter the viability of a food. Was the buffet all seafood?
24002,"That is awesome to hear , i bet the pays good too "
24003,if your happy there i would stay if not seek the better pay in a different town 
24004,Oh man that had to be embarrassing.  I know how you feel though b/c I once went to work with two different shoes on
24005,Well it will probably never happen again so don't worry about it to much
24006,I'm so sorry. I know that must be very difficult for you. It's nice that you have pictures to look at and remember old times together.
24007,Pictures are a great way to remember the past. I treasure every picture. Each holds a special memory.
24008,We all do it. I bet they deserved it.
24009,They sound like my kids. I hope they start behaving better for you.
24010,Dogs can be so destructive.
24011,Poor thing had no clue why you were mad
24012,"Ok ,so are you gonna go?"
24013,Dang three times?  I hope you get that figured out!
24014,Yeah get that right.  Make sure you don't fail it four times!
24015,"How shocking! I have got to know, are you keeping the puppies or giving them up for adoption?"
24016,Good idea. I hope they aren't too much of a handful until then!
24017,Oh that sounds horrible. I hope it wasn't a long ride on the bus. 
24018,"Oh no, that is a long time to be sitting in trash basically."
24019,i bet so. its a shame when people dont take care of their teeth
24020,i wouldnt doubt it!
24021,"I have found that using alot of online recipes with good instructions helps. Cannabis also induces hunger and reduced adhd thus it helps me pay better attention, even more so when I'm hungry af! "
24022,"yes I always pay attention to the reviews and peoples personal comments, they can often be priceless!"
24023,Not that I can think of. Can you give me an example?
24024,"Oh, I see what you mean. That's frustrating!"
24025,Did you at least study for it?
24026,That is the best feeling!
24027,"Oh wow, that really sucks. Did you ever find the culprit?"
24028,"Yeah, I would've definitely quit once I saw that."
24029,I hate when they do that! Were you able to clean the rug?
24030,I bet! Time to get him trained a little better.
24031,Wow that is huge. He must have a lot of stuff to haul.
24032,As long as he remembers to make wide turns. Otherwise bad things happen haha.
24033,Has it ever been a ghost?
24034,Yeah fears like that are pretty unconsolable.
24035,That's so awesome! What did he say?
24036,Oh my. What a strange first word.
24037,"I'm not quite sure I understand, did you go bowling by yourself? If so that's so sad and lonesome."
24038,"As someone who deals with lonesome moments, I know how that feels. I would've totally gone with you had I known you haha."
24039,did you feel like being spontaneous or just did it for the thrill of it
24040,"next time you go in, put the money of the candy into one of those charity cans"
24041,Yeah me too! Are you going to go with anyone?
24042,Nice! I am sure it is going to be a ball of a time.
24043,That is a real bummer. Maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life.
24044,"Yeah, no need to talk to me about it right now. Think about all the good times you had together."
24045,That really stinks. Have you gone to get some help on it?
24046,I am sure he will be able to help you. I hope you pass.
24047,Oh no. That sounds like a messy situation.
24048,Hopefully he'll learn that that's not the place to do that.
24049,I am sure once you clean up your scruffy look you'll be able to land all the ladies.
24050,"Nah, you can forgo deodorant. The media just tells everyone it's necessary since it's a poorly known method of government mind control."
24051,He must be related to my dog. Was it hard to clean up?
24052,You may want to check his diet. Something in not right there.
24053,That is so awesome! Good for her!
24054,Amazing! I would be proud if I were you as well!
24055,"Really, I can't believe you like it. Are you sure he bought it and not his mom lol?"
24056,Either way you have the perfect outfit to go on a date with your boyfriend right?
24057,Oh no! Is your dog trained to go outside?
24058,"I'm sorry to hear that. Just take some deep breaths, wear gloves and maybe even a mask if it makes you feel better. You can do this and you'll be alright!"
24059,"Yeah, I am the same way. Incredibly unsafe to do such a thing."
24060,I know. I don't want to die doing something incredibly mundane.
24061,i hope you feel bad about what you did 
24062,"as long as you can live with yourself , is all that matters lol"
24063,That sounds very relaxing. What kind of book was it?
24064,Oh I get that magazine too. I like it for the stories.
24065,Dang. What did you by? Mountain dew and doritos?
24066,A much better purchase than the neckbeard's staple. I hope you won!
24067,"That sucks, was it a nice rug?"
24068,"That's awful, put the dogs nose in it."
24069,Nice! Which one you getting?
24070,Dang! Now that is a savvy phone! I have 12 of them.
24071,Aw how wonderful. She must have been really proud of herself and happy.
24072,Truth be told: I never learned how to ride a bike.
24073,That sounds like an interesting life choice. It's probably very calming.
24074,It's an important tool set to have!
24075,"Have you been studying? If you do that, I am sure you won't fail."
24076,Nice! I am sure you will pass with flying colors.
24077,You are the 2nd one today. Was it a mile high?
24078,That must have been quite the workout. At least you should have plenty of fuel for the winter.
24079,oh thats a nice surprise
24080,thats really cool
24081,Shocking. Does that not happen often for you?
24082,Ah well better than me. I get it so much it doesn't even bother me anymore.
24083,Lol owning it is just about the only thing you can do at that point!
24084,I hope nobody in your office is the easily offended type!
24085,Nice! Did you steal anything while you were there?
24086,"Well, at least you filled your stomach. Next time, don't forget about your pockets!"
24087,"Congratulations, thats amazing.  What did he say?"
24088,"Wow, hes a pretty smart kid.  He must be reading up on his history and the communist manifesto."
24089,That's too bad. Did someone cut you off?
24090,Awww I would be sad too. Did anyone go and get it?
24091,Understandably so. You must be pretty anxious over the whole ordeal.
24092,That's a great idea. No need to let go of the place you call home completely. I hope everything works in your best interests!
24093,thats fair tho i wouldnt worry about it
24094,good luck with that
24095,That is a very nice friend. Moving is hard work.
24096,Hope you don't have to move again any time soon.
24097,I hate when that happens.  I bet that smelled great.
24098,My dog did that the other day.  I yelled at her and told her that we don't poop in the house
24099,Nice! Did you fall?
24100,"Oh no! Well, at least it sounded like you and everyone had a good time."
24101,eww i know how that feels
24102,Oh geez! I bet that was a CATastrophe!
24103,I bet. I would've been sick.
24104,"lol sorry for laughing , but that sounds like something i would agree to and forget, im afraid of heights too "
24105,"sometimes when my friends are annoying me , i tune out ... later o yeah we are supposed to do this today and blah , blah , blah"
24106,"Oh, that's a good point! I never realized how much money I was spending for fast food until I started making a budget."
24107,"My go to lazy-sandwich are fried balogna sandwiches. It's saved me a lot of money, that's for sure."
24108,That sucks. Are you hurt?
24109,I would be mad too. Are you going to sue?
24110,thats so amazing
24111,thats so cool
24112,That is unfortunate. I hope it wasn't 1 or 2 miles high?
24113,That amount of poop really does things to a rug. I recommend getting a new house.
24114,That sucks. Did you ever find any worms in the apples?
24115,"Yeah, if only I could go back and have a crisp apple with some snake oil...all would be right with the world."
24116,Mustve been some good convincing.  Was it a robbery?
24117,"Yea, my phone is pretty expensive.  Im not giving my phone to anybody"
24118,im not sure i think its just an old tradition
24119,Where did you lose it at?
24120,"Yeah, that is a good thing he found it and not someone else. What are the odds."
24121,They are so lucky. I would love to have a new car.
24122,"I would be jealous, because I drive an old clunker "
24123,Oh no! That's horrible. Were you able to clean it up?
24124,I could imagine.
24125,"thats great, good job."
24126,yea i tend to have similar issues
24127,happy birthday! are you exciteD?
24128,i hope you have a great time
24129,"Oh boy, did you embarrass yourself by getting real scared?"
24130,That's something that's easy to laugh about after the fact but I bet you were running for your life when it happened! Haha
24131,"I know what you mean.  Its an easy chore, but sometimes that smell is gross.  Its that sweet smell. yuck"
24132,Well now i definitely don't want to take the garbage out tonight.  Ill make someone else do it
24133,oh really? why was that?
24134,"understandable, no one should have to go hungry"
24135,That's horrible! What happened?
24136,That really sucks. I am glad you are okay.
24137,That really sucks. Maybe you should get another job?
24138,I am truly sorry for your lots. I am sure things will get better.
24139,Well that's great! I'm guessing he has a bad habit of doing that?
24140,I guess you've been training him and it's paying off? Tell him he's a good boy and give him a belly rub!
24141,"Oh that's so aggravating, my dog still has accidents but not many"
24142,That's terrible but the rug is replaceable. 
24143,"im sorry to hear that, my child hood friend died in a car crash , and it hurt me for a really long time, i still have dreams about him through out the years"
24144,"his family must be going through some tough times right now , i hope everything goes well"
24145,"I've actually heard a little bit about CBD oil from my sister, but I never did any research myself or try it out."
24146,"Oh wow, so it actually works? I might have to give it a try and let me mother know about it, she has a lot of pain in her legs as well."
24147,I absolutely will! Thanks for the suggestion.
24148,That sounds like so much fun.  What concert is it?
24149,Don't stop believin.  I bet you'll have a great time!
24150,I wouldn't look forward to that either. What are you going in for?
24151,That doesn't sound grand at all. Hopefully it is a painless procedure.
24152,That's super nice of her!
24153,Good parents are super useful!
24154,That sounds like a job!
24155,I wish you good luck with that!
24156,Why did you steal candy from the store?
24157,Did you not have any money to pay for it?
24158,Oh no!  Is that the first time it has happened?
24159,May I recommend gloves?  Thick gloves.  And a lot of carpet cleaner.
24160,"Wow, that really stinks. Did you catch the culprit?"
24161,"Yeah, especially since I imagine that is a costly monthly expense. I would install some turrets in your garage."
24162,That's always fun to clean up.
24163,"Think of it this way. Yesterday I had to clean up my dog's vomit, where it vomited up a used tampon."
24164,Nice! Which game is it?
24165,Sounds really fun! I think I will pick it up today.
24166,That's cool. What city?
24167,Oh sweet. I hope he has a good time in college.
24168,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. How long did you have your rabbit for?
24169,I could imagine. I don't have any pets. But I understand it can be really devastating.
24170,Oh no! We're you able to clean it up?
24171,Yeah hopefully it doesn't happen again!
24172,Ew! Sounds like a disgusting job.
24173,That's great! Good to hear you're saving some money!
24174,"I do too, but seems like most people are like that nowadays"
24175,"I would be mad, we had that problem all the time at the last place we lived. "
24176,Oops. Could you sneak it back in without him seeing you?
24177,"Depends how close you are and how mad he'll be. Usually, I advocate honesty, but don't know enough about your situation to advise."
24178,"Oh boy. I honestly don't know what to say. Maybe ask him outright if he's cheating. If he is, do you really want to stay with him? If not, it doesn't matter if he knows about the phone or not!"
24179,Good luck! But be nice - I've confronted people before and totally lost it. I then regretted it.
24180,"That sucks, hope it didn't dry into the carpet."
24181,That's pretty understandable.
24182,"thats great, good job"
24183,i know that feel
24184,Nice! Where is he going to school at?
24185,"Wow, that's pretty far away. How do you feel about him going all the way up there?"
24186,"dangit , i would have been pretty upset , not to mention the clean up "
24187,"shhhhhheeeeess , that would have given me a small heart of attack or just tunnel vision out of rage"
24188,That's so sad! Maybe you should give him a call?
24189,That's the spirit! The loneliness should melt away!
24190,Oh no!! You must have been so mad!
24191,That dog probably wouldn't be living in my house anymore!! Did you have it cleaned?
24192,That is not good.  Did you scold your cat?
24193,I can imagine.  My dog used to stain the carpet too.
24194,That really sucks. What kind of car was it?
24195,"Ah, I used to have one of those. Those cars were built to last."
24196,"I think the opposite, honestly."
24197,"Yeah I know, thanks."
24198,What happened?? You did not studied hard enough?
24199,the best thing for you is learn from this and do better next time 
24200,That was nice of your neighbor! I hope everything was still inside of it!
24201,That's such a relief! It's such a hassle to cancel all of your credit cards and get a new ID! You should give him a reward!
24202,Nice! What grade is your son in?
24203,Nice! I am sure he is going to be hanging with the popular folk in no time.
24204,Ha! At least you're confident in your skills. Do you do anything special to it?
24205,That is all good to know! I'll have to keep it in mind next time I cook it.
24206,"That is terrible, I am so sorry. Was it of natural causes?"
24207,You can just replace him that fast? Don't you need time?
24208,Thats pretty brave of you facing a fear like that.  How did you feel when the flight was over?
24209,Flights are convenient though.  Definetly faster than driving somewhere
24210,How exciting! Where to?
24211,I am happy for you and hope you have a lot of fun!
24212,Congratulation! thats awesome. I know how much work that can be
24213,You'll get there one day.  It takes time and saving 
24214,Lol are they still holdig that against you?
24215,Lol. We all cheated at some point.  They know that.
24216,Did you try to find someone to go with?
24217,Maybe you should find some new friends.
24218,"Mine did too - 5 minutes ago, actually. Are you thinking about getting a new one?"
24219,That's too bad. Perhaps it would help you heal your troubles away.
24220,Hell yeah! Return of the king!
24221,"Yup, he's been through a lot"
24222,Oh yeah. Makes for a great game when it's close!
24223,I am so happy for you! I have been married for ten years and it is the most rewarding thing ever. But you should be nervous because in two months you have to share everything.
24224,"Thank you . Well lets talk about the wedding, hopefully you have a wedding planner to help you right. I don't want you to stress out to much, you are the excited bride!"
24225,"Well good, let her do all the worrying and you focus on your big day!"
24226,"Oh wow, that's kind of rude."
24227,Have you brought it up to her? Maybe she doesn't realize she's doing it.
24228,where did it go?
24229,"I hope so, hope is still alive, and Have you search everywhere?"
24230,Oh no! How did you find out?
24231,"Ah, I see. I hope you find someone more respectful and caring"
24232,Oh that is awesome! Even barely awesome employers are hard to find.
24233,Yeah they generally have a better chance at giving it more so than large entities.
24234,"Oh yeah, especially when it is something you are really looking forward to receiving."
24235,"Yep, but at least we have the internet to take care of those things."
24236,did you try redoing your steps of the last day? to see maybe you left it at a friends house
24237,"i feel bad for you, have you tried asking other people that are near you often to see if they have seen it?"
24238,What do you love about football season? (They're football right?)
24239,"Wonderful! Good luck, I hope they win."
24240,What are they repeating?
24241,I hope you can provide them with some help.
24242,It's awesome. Sometimes I also try to find solutions in youtube.
24243,"Yeah, you're right."
24244,That's terrible. Did you guys clear that out?
24245,People must have no lives to want to spread rumors like that.
24246,Oh my. How did you handle the situation with your toddler?
24247,They can be pretty crazy at that age.
24248,I bet your so excited! I just got one last month too and it makes my life so much easier!
24249,AOL slow Lol.. I certainly know how you feel! I would have expedited it to me!
24250,where did he go
24251,I'm assuming they didn't leave insurance info?
24252,"That sucks, man. Are you gonna get it fixed?"
24253,"Yikes, high risk investment?"
24254,Is it something that can recover over time? I hope so
24255,"A lot of marriages also end in divorce, when they go into it too soon."
24256,You'll find someone. You sound like a good person.
24257,why did your friendship with your friend ended?
24258,"that is true i agree with you, that is not what friends do"
24259,For what purpose you do this
24260,How his your health now
24261,You sound lonely. Do you not have any friends?
24262,Have you considered joining any hobby groups to make some new friends?
24263,oh thats sweet. congrats
24264,im sure it wont take you long with that degree
24265,That's terrible!  Were you in a bad part of town or anything?
24266,That kind of thing always creeps me out.  Glad you made it ok!
24267,"Why is that, is there something scheduled today that you really are trying to avoid?"
24268,"My first marriage was much like that, I hope you have a very calm day and no arguing."
24269,Great job!  Did anything else come with it?
24270,"Yeah, anything is better than nothing.  Good work!"
24271,did you take it in to get fixed?
24272,ah i understand now
24273,I hear you! What made you feel all alone?
24274,Oh okay! Where did they go?
24275,What time was that?
24276,Wow long time! Are you still at this job?
24277,Complaint them about the product
24278,OMG. That's unfair
24279,You must be proud. What kind of cake did you make.
24280,I love tres leche.  I haven't had a slice of that in forever.
24281,Oh god. Are you ok?
24282,We've all been embarassed at work lol. Don't even worry about it.
24283,Did you propose her?
24284,"Oh, so sad. You may try one more time."
24285,What was the size?
24286,Oh cool! Does he have a country club membership? What were you doing that you couldn't go?
24287,Oh I am sorry! Bummer to miss out
24288,Oh I bet that was so good
24289,That is always a good feeling
24290,AMAZING! Congrats! 
24291,How long does film school last?
24292,So you have two dogs? That is so nice I love dogs.
24293,"Beautiful, sounds like she is in good hands. "
24294,they must have something against trucks
24295,that's true and also not a good sign if a cop decides to pull you over
24296,Is your current ceiling fan broken?
24297,"Nice, I hope you enjoy it.   Grats on the house too."
24298,OH! I do too! They are so healthy and you can get them without any sugar too!
24299,"Oh...well you should try it without, fruit itself is already full of sugar :) If you try the ones with orange juice, they can be pretty sweet on their own."
24300,"I'm sorry to hear that, sounds like family took a trip?"
24301,I'm glad the bad times have stopped and hope your furkids can help cheer you up. I feel lonely at times too it's only human.
24302,Oh yes they are! I love it when that happens
24303,"Lol! Cool, what kind of memory did it trigger?"
24304,Oh you are brave! I LOVE the ocean but I am terrified of being in the middle of it :)
24305,How fast are they supposed to be going?
24306,"There's a lot of selfish people in the world, and a lot of impatient ones too. It's extremely frustrating."
24307,did you mute it
24308,i hate when that happens
24309,We don't see many here. Do you live in a city?
24310,"Well, the city probably should do something about it."
24311,What happened to make him flood things? Something overflowed?
24312,That's too bad. Well I hope it didn't ruin anything special??
24313,What happened? Is she undergoing it for depression or what?
24314,So disgusting to see such irresponsible parents bringing up a child in such conditions. Hope for him to be well
24315,That sucks.  Someone in a parking lot do  that to you?
24316,and I bet they just drove off and didn't even leave a note.
24317,thats cool!
24318,it sure does feel  good that someone notices
24319,That has to be really annoying.  Have you called animal control?
24320,"Yes, that's one way to deal with it.  What did you end up doing?"
24321,I'm sorry to hear that. Was there something going on around you that made you scared?
24322,"Wooded ares are beautiful, until you have to be alone in them, when it's dark."
24323,What was impressive about that?
24324,Everyone knew he was going to do it though
24325,that sounds cool
24326,i bet it was
24327,That sounds like so much fun. I've actually never been to a casino but would love to.
24328,I would feel the same way. I'm not always very lucky though so I'd be a little apprehensive at first.
24329,I'm sure she'll be happy with whatever gift you got her.
24330,What was it that she wanted?
24331,Wow.  How much did they win?
24332,"Jeez, that's a lot!  I hope they can manage it ok."
24333,you try calling for a status update?
24334,ah it happens i guess
24335,Pets are great companions! What kind of pet is it?
24336,Wow I was not expecting that! I'm happy that you get to spend time with it.
24337,"Why? What's going on? Or, y'know, not going on ?"
24338,Is there something going on that's got you feeling that way?
24339,"Slippery floor, or slippery you ?"
24340,"Oh, been there before. Sometimes I'm given things that make me very unsteady."
24341,what did she do? woke up late?
24342,ah yea mine does that.. i have a spray bottle for days like that :)
24343,Oh no. That is gorrible
24344,Did the person stop?
24345,Why on earth would someone do that? A totally pointless act!
24346,"Some people will steal anything, I guess. A store employee once told me they had to keep certain things by the checkout or they walked!"
24347,It sure is! I got caught (when I was about 8) bouncing a ping pong ball while leaving a toy store. The owner took me home and my Dad gave me a hiding. Never again!
24348,Oh yes. While other teenagers were thieving I was being a very good little girl! Hope you get a replacement for your trash can.
24349,How'd they do?
24350,Good for them
24351,On your car?? Did you get it on camera?
24352,Oh bummer! I can't stand it when people are that selfish! I wish we had CCTV cameras everywhere like they do in the UK
24353,i bet it was!
24354,i wouldnt even try that
24355,"Sounds annoying, she needs to be more careful"
24356,Oh wow like for law school? or what you take after law school?
24357,That is really awesome! I bet is a a relief that its done now!
24358,Oh Wow! That is awesome! I wonder who did it.
24359,That was very kind of them.
24360,Is it really bad one?
24361,i hope so too
24362,you can do it!
24363,that does sound like fun
24364,"I would have been as well, how late was it? "
24365,sounds super scary! my god. 
24366,Oh lord! Why did you need to lie?
24367,Oh ok! Well I can understand that.
24368,aweee you got puppies? i barely sleep so i feel you
24369,that's so sweet of you that you adopted an abused dog and taking care of her
24370,I'm sorry to hear that. Why couldn't you go home?
24371,That's crazy! Is it always so busy?
24372,what did you say
24373,oh well .. next time will be easier
24374,That sounds crappy! When do they close? 
24375,Sounds like a good idea! I would do the same. 
24376,Storms can be quite scary! Is it over now?
24377,"Hopefully, that's the last storm for a while."
24378,That's awesome! I hope it's a good paying job.
24379,"I know what you mean, I hate job searching."
24380,What kind of pet was it
24381,Oh that sounds scary
24382,oh im sorry to hear that
24383,well it sounds like it has gotten a little easier which is always good.
24384,"My cat hasn't been feeling well this past week, I think there might be something really wrong."
24385,For the vet to see me cat.
24386,did he pass away?
24387,have you gotten a new pet or still too soon?
24388,"Oh no, how big is the dent?"
24389,Not too bad. Is it deep?
24390,I bet you are a happy parent then
24391,I guess thats all kids though
24392,Sounds really fun do you go kayaking often? 
24393,I bet you are going to go more often now. Kayaking is really enjoyable. 
24394,thats awesome news! congrats
24395,is it going to be a big wedding or small?
24396,Why did you have to walk home alone?
24397,That's awful. Are you ok now?
24398,I do too! Do you feel like you are prepared?
24399,Maybe practice with a friend or spouse! That may help you feel a little more confident.
24400,i think you are right about that
24401,Whats happening next week? 
24402,Oh thats right mine arent old enough yet so I dont have that type of joy but im happy for you! ha ha 
24403,"Audis are pretty nice. You must feel a bit jealous, hu?"
24404,He might have a large monthly payment.
24405,ah damn!! it would have been pretty embarrassing!!
24406,She must have been shy to tell you that
24407,"Oh man, what do you think happened to it?"
24408,I've had that happen. Are you going back to get it?
24409,How long have you been working there for? 
24410,Kinda creepy then that you are randomly the only one there 
24411,That's awesome. Do you workout regularly?
24412,I should get to that as well.
24413,That was very nice of you though
24414,It was still a nice thing to do
24415,Yea that can be hard sometimes. Im sure will understand.
24416,Im sure she knows how hard you work to provide for her.
24417,hard work pays of
24418,keep up the good work!
24419,Gross! Do you work in a restaurant?
24420,That's sucks. I bet all that food smells.
24421,"Congratulations! That's getting to the point where you look at their homework and realize you forgot how difficult it was, ha."
24422,"Oh Lord, I have forgotten almost everything I learned in Algebra and beyond."
24423,Oh wow. How long has it been since you last spoke with her?
24424,That's awesome. I know you were happy to receive that in the mail! 
24425,do you give them money?
24426,yea me too
24427,oh damn!! did you find who it was?
24428,ah that sucks!! bad luck!!
24429,Oh no! Did you actually see them do it? 
24430,That is really frustrating. Were you able to claim it on your insurance? I can't imagine how frustrating that must have felt. 
24431,I bet that was fun. Like where? A museum or something Lol
24432,Oh wow that is surprising. Did you guys have a picnic?
24433,that's a mess and i feel pity for you
24434,"Use thinner which is used for painting , i think that ought to do"
24435,"Stay positive, you never know. Maybe send them a polite email saying thank you for the interview and things you liked about the company."
24436,"It can't hurt! Just keep on applying, even to job that are above or below your skill levels."
24437,What were young to do with your freetime?
24438,Oh I have always wanted to do that
24439,what did he do to it?
24440,"Nice, I'm sure you are a great uncle! It's fun to be youthful sometimes and relive childhood memories!"
24441,Yes defenitly! I see my daughter who is a toddler and love to see all that life in her!
24442,mine started today!!
24443,thats always good when they cant wait to return
24444,That's always disappointing. In time for what?
24445,"Oh that's too bad. I am sure you felt bad, but your son probably understood."
24446,"Sounds like life is finally moving the right direction for you, it's great to be thankful for the simple things in life!"
24447,Yes :) people get so caught up in material things and forgot how blessed they are to have food and shelter!
24448,Why's that? What happened?
24449,That can be scary! There's usually nobody in the woods though luckily.
24450,did you call the po-po ?
24451,yea they are dumb.
24452,wow that sounds nice
24453,hard work pays off i guess
24454,"Great, where will you be going ?"
24455,Don't take too much money with you.
24456,You should make a sign that says something about your lunch on it?
24457,are you able to go real early before the crowds get there?
24458,ah that makes sense
24459,It's awesome. Hope you're getting promotions at right time.
24460,Good for you!
24461,Were you supposed to?
24462,I hope they get it figured out for you. How frustrating. 
24463,"Why was he suspended, did he do something wrong?"
24464,"Did it every get straightened out, that sounds pretty terrible."
24465,"Well, that's different at least."
24466,what do you do to get prepared
24467,thats a smart idea
24468,What kind of dog was it?
24469,Was it a big one?
24470,Why were you late
24471,"That happened to me too, I hate it"
24472,yea i also love my sister pet
24473,yea its fun
24474,tell me about it.
24475,That's good :)  Having a good family always makes life easier.
24476,I bet!  Mine have been really great too!
24477,That's terrible! How long did you study for it?
24478,I bet you put a lot of effort into it. Maybe you could talk to him and plead your case to get him to reconsider.
24479,"That must've been scary, what kind of mask!"
24480,Do you plan on getting her back later?
24481,Maybe try a freddy mask this time.
24482,That's good to hear! How long is the vacation for?
24483,That's not too bad. I hope you have a fun and relaxing vacation!
24484,what kind of sub is it
24485,ah that sounds tasty
24486,What kinda glass?
24487,"He'll probably be upset, but I'm sure he'll come around. It was an accident."
24488,"I'm sorry to hear that, you got to check though."
24489,What happened that lead to it?
24490,Yay!  I love dogs!  Do you have any you want to get specifically or are you just going to look until you find one that clicks?
24491,Congratulations!  I'm sure she's going to be super happy!
24492,"I'm sorry to hear that, did you do anything to not feel so lonely?"
24493,"Ah, I see. Was it a good kind of alone then?"
24494,is that a good thing or bad thing?
24495,oh congrats then. i hope all goes well for them!
24496,have you gone to the doctor yet? or is it not that serious
24497,"oh ok, so it is just a  common cold then?"
24498,I'm sorry to hear that! Is it that busy at work?
24499,Oh are you a teacher?
24500,thats great of him to stick by her side. you dont see that anymore
24501,thats a good story.
24502,What did you get in debt for?
24503,Was it worth it?
24504,Oh wow! That's amazing. Congratulations!
24505,Are you undergrad or grad student?
24506,"That's awesome! Life moves fast, doesn't it?"
24507,Oh so he's your little brother? You must be so proud of him.
24508,Wow. I'd just use that as motivated to get better. I'm sure you can get to her level or exceed it with some deligence.
24509,We can't compare ourselves to others. It'll just make you miserable. There will always be someone who is better in something. You could be better at something that someone else isn't.
24510,oh wow.. gonna be the next bobby flay!
24511,"If you have the drive for it, im sure you will do great!"
24512,Parking lot accidents are so rampant.
24513,Are you gonna get it repaired?
24514,It sure did. Did you get a chance to relax and have some fun?
24515,So am I. Would you be okay with longer work days then?
24516,Nice friend. All of mine have been gone for decades.
24517,"Sure is, last time I saw one was some time in the 90s."
24518,where is your trip at? why are you so exited
24519,"wow i have always wanted to go to las vegas, good luck and dont gamble all your money haha"
24520,I love package delivery days!  I've got a couple coming as well.  What are you waiting for?
24521,"Oh wow, a big package!  Hope you enjoy it!"
24522,Ouch... I'd have to admit that it would make me a tad nervous.
24523,Absolutely! That is definitely the attitude to have. Trust is huge in making a relationship successful. It's just natural to feel a bit nervous.
24524,hahaha you must be so proud! How long did it take you to teach him?
24525,"Man, I'd love to see that!"
24526,"Dang, heartbreaking. If I were your co-worker and you told me that, I'd lend you at least a couple bucks for the vending machines or something. Hopefully you can go home and have a nice dinner."
24527,"Ah, there you go. The world isn't completely heartless. Yeah, I think the trick is to always keep that stuff with your car keys, because then you'll never forget it."
24528,"Ouch that sucks.   Honestly, if you had a crappy obamacare bronze plan its unlikely they'd pay for anything anyways.  Its always a nightmare.    You've got to spend a fair amont of cash before they cover anything but a checkup."
24529,"Yep, you'll probably be fine. Give it a couple of days. "
24530,thats a bad feeling :/ dont be too hard on yourself 
24531,Yeah but its a test! Its not like you cheated on your spouse or did something severe! lol 
24532,That is always a good feeling. 
24533,Thats the spirit. It is always exciting to start something new.
24534,That must be so nice having that freedom.
24535,Do you feel you could see yourself marrying her?
24536,"Lucky you, my girlfriend Elaine is a bit mean sometimes."
24537,I love dogs! I bet you were so happy. 
24538,"Oh my god, I've always wanted a husky! You are so lucky. They do have beautiful eyes."
24539,"Oooh, that's exciting!  What schools did you apply for?"
24540,That's worth being nervous over.  I'm sure you'll do great!
24541,Oh yeah what do you plan on doing? 
24542,Sounds like a good time! 
24543,did you have some back up clothes ?
24544,"I'm sorry, that made me laugh. Never really seen a parrot speak that well before. Thought it as just something you see in movies. Does it say anything else fun?"
24545,"That's... a really interesting strategy. Wonder what will happen once he actually does lose weight and doesn't want to be called fat anymore! Well, I guess to each their own."
24546,I'm so sorry to hear that. It's hard losing someone that dear to her. I hope she opens herself up to healing.
24547,"It's gonna take some time, and I'm sure those phone calls help more than you think."
24548,I did that 32 years ago in high school.
24549,"Right, I understand that. It's not a nice thing."
24550,What is your wifes name?
24551,Do you love her lots?
24552,thats a bummer! How long ago did you lose it? 
24553,"Well I hope you find it, and a winning lotto ticket at the same time. "
24554,Good to hear! Congrats!!
24555,Hope you'll receive more bonus in upcoming days!!
24556,what did you all make
24557,that sounds tasty.
24558,did he do it in a normal fashion or did he stared at you weird
24559,you should have told someone that is how robbers usually target people
24560,That's great! Are you trying to buy a house?
24561,It's nice to have a place of your own. I remember the excitement I felt when I bought my house.
24562,thats good that it wasnt major.
24563,That's a good way to go into an interview. Did it go well?
24564,"Awesome, congrats on your new job."
24565,I bet you can't wait. Is it a substantial raise?
24566,That's fantastic. Congratulations! Buy yourself a little treat.
24567,I'm glad you've found a change of pace.
24568,Of course it is. I'd say it'll benefit each other.
24569,"Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that you don't have enough money for food, but stealing isn't the answer! Maybe there's a local food bank you can contact."
24570,"Call your local support services. Usually it's 211. They can put you in contact with charities, churches and other organizations who can help you! I wish you the best!"
24571,Did you ask him to wash the dishes?
24572,You should do to him a strong amount of punishment!
24573,I hope your dog is found safe!
24574,i hope it goes well!
24575,That is fantastic. Anything new going on?
24576,I wish I was that content with my life. I have too many changes going on right now.
24577,I bet it did. I would love to listen to my old cds
24578,What a fun way to reminisce. 
24579,"Yeah, you're right. are you in reunion now?"
24580,It's very hard to leave. But the memories will always cheer with us. 
24581,Did you prepare for it?
24582,It's not too late. You will have to pull an all nighter and study. If you are prepared you will feel better about going.
24583,Are you going to get another?
24584,Probably best to also take time to process what happened
24585,Amazing! How old is he?
24586,Good on him! For what it's worth I'm super proud of him! 
24587,"That must be annoying, what kind of dog?"
24588,Maybe try asking the neighbor about him?
24589,"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of test was it?"
24590,Calculus seems like very hard stuff for anyone. Don't feel too down. Just use this as motivation to study more!
24591,That's the spirit! Never quit and give up. Everyone fails sometimes.
24592,Do you have a rather large family?
24593,Will you have music and dance?
24594,Maybe you should confront them about it.
24595,Heck yeah. Tackle the issue head on! Maybe it'll workout and they'll try to be nicer.
24596,"Aw, thanks. I hope it all works out for you. Have a great day!"
24597,Oh no what happened? Why don't you think you did well?
24598,I hope its better than you expect!
24599,Ooh that is rough having to prepare for. How do you think you did?
24600,"That's awesome! I'm so glad to hear that! Hopefully this boosts your confidence for next time, now you know you can do it."
24601,oh its really frustrating and not fair
24602,ok don't feel bad be happy and search for your future behalf
24603,"Warcraft - that's an online role play game, right?"
24604,I'm afraid I avoid those games - too addictive. I'd never get anything else done! Presumably you play.
24605,Hmm. Perhaps I should have a look then. I just have such an addictive personality - Hopeless!
24606,"Oh, there are plenty of those, believe me, lol. At least you enjoy it tho'. That's good."
24607,not really
24608,"I know, is it like when I got my new car?"
24609,A ford mustang I always like muscle cars!
24610,"Pontiac makes good cars. But more importantly your wardrobe mishap is a little funny, sorry. Hope everything worked out."
24611,That's awesome! Did you get a good deal?
24612,Some people enjoy fixing things. That will be fun if you're ready for it. What kind of car did you get?
24613,Not me. I'd be walking if i did. 
24614,YouTube makes things so much easier to learn. 
24615,Oh jeeze. Did they catch them on film?  Hopefully insurance will take care of it.
24616,won the lottery?
24617,well thats good too!
24618,I love animals! What kind of pet does she have?
24619,"Oh wow, that's unusual. "
24620,uh oh! Have you checked your sugar lately?
24621,"After that bag of candy, you may want to!"
24622,"I'm jealous of you. I'm a little introverted and antisocial, and never got good at developing friendships where I could make them long-lasting and trustworthy. Good for you"
24623,"Yeah, since I've been in college, I've been forced to socialize more and I'm getting better at it. It's a muscle just like anything else I guess, and you have to ""work it out."" "
24624,"That's great! Anything helps as you said, keep trying for more!"
24625,We certainly need to do better as a country to make higher education more affordable.
24626,"Oh, what kind of relationship is it?"
24627,"Yikes, stop the relationship at all cost!"
24628,Are you happy for her?
24629,Well if you treat her right she won't go any where. 
24630,Oh yea? Is it for higher pay or just needing a different scenery?
24631,Is the new city have a higher cost of living?
24632,I feel you man.  I'm off in 1 hour and 11 minutes.  tick tock.
24633,Its a small world... maybe we even work at the same place.
24634,"Oh god, I think we've all gone through that. Did you have nice undies on though?"
24635,Oh that's not too bad then!
24636,It's pretty good! Hope you had a good time!
24637,Sure. Visit again and suggest your friends too.
24638,Oh boy! Is it yours?
24639,I love puppies. What kind of breed is it?
24640,Have you tried driving around and looking for it? Or calling the neighbors for help? Maybe they have seen it.
24641,I hope they are able to locate him! Check to see if your friend had it microchipped.
24642,It is tough! Do you have family nearby?
24643,That would be hard. 
24644,Cool. Girl or boy?
24645,Are yo going to spoil him?
24646,I know what you mean lol
24647,"Oh boy, what are you going to do?  Do you have a good bus system you can use?"
24648,I hear you!  I hate physical activity that seems unnecessary. 
24649,HAHAHAHAHA.  I love that plan!
24650,Oh goodness! That is terrible to hear! Have you contacted someone to help clean it up? That can easily cause mold.
24651,Try seeing if your insurance with cover it. If not grab a shop vac or 2! They are great at sucking up water out of tight spaces
24652,That's a bummer.  Did you make her chicken noodle soup
24653,"That's good she's got a nurturing / caring mom, I know some pretty bad parents out there"
24654,"They never learn, do they ?"
24655,"Oh well, we tried didn't we."
24656,That's so nice of you to be supportive to your friend through struggles.  Is it a long time struggle or something sudden?
24657,That's awful.  Its so good they have someone like you who is there for them when they need you most.
24658,"Oh well, you will get it clean"
24659,I guess try and get those done first
24660,Congratulations! I bet you're happy.
24661,I'm super happy for you! You'll do great.
24662,"That is great, what kind of dancer is she?"
24663,"I'm impressed, where did she win the medal?"
24664,That's awful. Is she alright now?
24665,Hope she will be fine soon!
24666,That is pretty unsettling.  Whereabouts do you live
24667,I used to live close to North Minneapolis and I would always hear people fighting in the streets and every once in a while a gunshot.  Got pretty desensitized to it though
24668,What is a clean fade
24669,Oh it sounds kind of cool
24670,That's a shame. What is it that prevents you from getting them done?
24671,Financial constraints are definitely a good reason. Maybe one of your friends could help you out.
24672,Cool Do they have tournaments?
24673,Me either lol. I wold be a good water boy lol
24674,Thats some really good progress right there
24675,I guess that could make you regret even the things you never thought og
24676,What was the basic jist of what they were saying?
24677,"That's something I personally struggle with. I never feel like I have enough money to hand out, but there's many people worse off than me who could use it."
24678,"That is amazing, what level is the team?"
24679,"That is even more impressive!  I know they take hockey seriously up there, so your friend must be pretty darn good."
24680,I hope he does.  It would be good to have a friend in the NHL!
24681,You must be some proud of that.
24682,Do you think she has a future in music?
24683,Nice were they guy friends or girl friends
24684,Why did you feel cocky...did you talk to any hotties at the bar or what
24685,"Oh, how do they go for that?"
24686,Do they like you doing that?
24687,I do not believe that
24688,"I hate when that happens, did you try to get a refund?"
24689,"Well, hopefully they get it resolved. Does not help your lunch today however."
24690,I don't blame you!  I would've been furious if some girl was talking to my husband that way.  Ridulous how awful some people are.
24691,"Ha ha, that's a good one.  "
24692,"I would hate that. Luckily my dog makes enough noise for 5! My kids are grown and gone, too."
24693,Pit/wolf hybrid. She helps so much.
24694,gosh that is horrible! Did you try to call the company? next time chooe a company that guarantees they will come or the service is free
24695,"oh yes, i understand, i had no choice either. there is only one provider in my area"
24696,I'm dealing with the same thing right now! I had to teach her how to parralel park yesterday! It is terrifying! 
24697,You can take her to the DMV when they are closed! They will allow you to use there set up to help.
24698,I'm so sorry to hear that. How long has it been if I may ask?
24699,"I am very sure he was proud of you, and cherished every moment he could spend with you while he was alive."
24700,That sounds like a fun event
24701,I am sure you will get it soon as well
24702,That's more rare than diamonds.  You'd better hold on to him
24703,Awesome.  Can I get his number ;)
24704,There is no better feeling than getting off of work!
24705,Maybe you can knock off 43 minutes early.
24706,That is the worst!
24707,That's too bad. What age is he?
24708,Oh no! Does he have the option of taking it again?
24709,Oh no! I would have a heart attack! Are you able to take time away from life so unexpectedly to spend time with them?
24710,hahaha I would have been like a mad woman trying to clean too! I hope it works out and your husband can take time off!
24711,Have you thought about cutting it down?
24712,Sounds pretty creepy
24713,"Impressive, what do you plan to do with the degree?"
24714,"Cool, I hope you find success, and that your hard work pays off. "
24715,"That's the worst, what did you eat then?"
24716,Oh no! You should try to find the culprit and confront them
24717,"Hahahahaha.  I'm sorry for laughing, but that struck me as funny.  Is he trying his best, or is he trying to get the point across that he shouldn't be cooking?"
24718,That might be a good Christmas present.  You could do it as a couple.  I did one of those with my wife last year and it was a blast.
24719,I hear those wildfires are getting really bad. I hope they don't affect you too badly.
24720,Drive safe! I really hope they can get those wildfires under control soon. 
24721,"Oh, I'm so excited for you! I hope you get a raise too!"
24722,Me too! As long as it's not bad news right?
24723,"That would be hard, can one work independently? "
24724,"I'm sure you are doing an amazing job, you seem to care which makes you a great parent."
24725,"I am sorry to hear that, what did you dog do to make you angry?"
24726,"I hate to hear that, hopefully you were able to get your garden lined out."
24727,"Oh my goodness, that must have been humiliating.  What did you do?"
24728,Did it happen after you got out of the pool?
24729,I am so sorry that happened to you.
24730,"Oh my gosh, that's the dream haha. What did you eat the most of?"
24731,"Wow, that's dedication. I guess those plates add up. That's not a very nice policy for a restaurant to have."
24732,"Awesome, what was it for?"
24733,Be grateful. Most people don't have a team to make them look good by comparison.
24734,Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ;D
24735,hahaha.   Kids are wonderful. 
24736,Well that's wonderful that you had a supporting aunt like that. How do you think you did on your test?
24737,"Well, I'm real glad for you! You should make your aunt a pie or something sometime."
24738,haha..yeah it is kid of pointless but it is a little fun as a kid. im sure your son will remember 
24739,i agree. i remember a lot of obscure things that my parents are surprised i remember.
24740,Excellent! Which beach?
24741,I'm jealous.
24742,where are you guys going? 
24743,"that's awesome! how long are you staying there? i'm sure you will enjoy your time. i went to mississippi a couple of months ago to see my family, it was so awesome"
24744,Do you sleep better when it rains too?
24745,Oh well at least you get to listen to it now
24746,"Oh no! Have you tried the old ""put it in a bag of rice"" trick?"
24747,"Give it a few days (even though it feels like a million). I'll cross my fingers for you! I'm so sorry, that is a huge bummer!"
24748,oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. I wish i could come over and help you clean up
24749,that's good. what are you having for dinner?
24750,"Oof, are you sure you don't want to try a half marathon first? You'll need to train quite a bit before doing a full marathon"
24751,Oh! Well then stay hydrated! I hope you do well!
24752,Don't worry. Soon you'll get good friends.
24753,"Yeah, you should explore it!"
24754,glad to hear that. im guessing you have studied hard?
24755,congratulations!! im glad to hear that. was the exam hard?
24756,Oh no that is terrible. Is there anyone near you that could be of help? Maybe a family member or someone that can lend a hand or ear? I'm so sorry to hear this.
24757,"I know it means swallowing some pride, but if it's financial help you need, perhaps you could go the route of Gofundme? or maybe government services? I know it might be embarrassing to some people, but sometimes your back is against the wall you have nothing to lose."
24758,I'm happy that you got a new turkey friar and fried your first turkey. You do seem like you would enjoy that. 
24759,"Hey, some people are on this planet to fry birds, and some people aren't. I guess that's just how it is."
24760,I understand how you feel.  My sister struggled to get pregnant. She did invitro twice.   
24761,The first one didn't work. Apparently the second one did.... but that's supposed to be a secret for now.  She's supposed to surprise me and my father with shirts....  my mom is a loud mouth and spilled the beans though.
24762,Yeah.  Apparently she's just as bad as my sisters's Mother in law.  She spent a good amount of time complaining about it.
24763,Sounds wonderful!  Nothing better than putting your feet up at the end of the day.  Think you might watch some tv?
24764,Hope you have an enjoyable evening and relaxing sleep!  Love me some tv too!  I'm watch Great Food Truck Race tonight!
24765,"Oh no! I'm sure it was awful at the time, but it'll be a good story when he grows up!"
24766,That is too funny. They'll grow out of it soon enough!
24767,That sucks. What type of team?
24768,I'm sorry.
24769,"That's amazing, how old is your son these days?"
24770,"That's nice that you can share things like that, it seems like your family is very close!"
24771,That sounds risky but at the same time if it works out convenient! 
24772,I am sure it will be fine!  It's not like you don't know where they live haha
24773,"I've never cried at work, but I've wanted to lol."
24774,"Yeah they can be. But, sometimes you just got to tough it out."
24775,You're doing good.
24776,Lovely. I too love pets.
24777,"Oh that's nice, you guys get to throw a party if you want haha"
24778,I bet you'll do great.  I would be nervous too.  Hopefully it won't be anything too serious and more cut and dry decision.  Have you gone before?
24779,i have never been before since I was either very ill or had babies/kids.  Good luck and don't stress too much. You'll be great!
24780,I hate when they do that. They make it so hard to pay for
24781,They sound like a shady hospital to me
24782,Oh boy. I know just how you feel. Could you persuade them to go to a restaurant?
24783,"Good for you! I'd be so busy yelling at my husband I'd forget to cook, lol. Do you know them well?"
24784,"Well, that's at least something! It's when he decides to invite the boss and his wife over when you'd decided dinner was mac n' cheese - that's when it gets hairy!"
24785,That would be scary! Were you able to catch her?
24786,"That's good, there is nothing scarier than a fur baby missing!"
24787,"Wow, thats so cool! I wish i could rock climb."
24788,I can understand that. I have MS so I'm no stranger to autoimmune diseases.
24789,Why did you lie to her?
24790,"Oh, well you a very naughty person."
24791,That would be tough. I think I was one of the last one's not required to take foreign language.
24792,I wish you the best in dealing with this.
24793,"I hear you on that. I'm visiting my girlfriend, but she still has to work, so the weekend is really the only time we can hang out. Do you have any special plans?"
24794,That's a good idea. We actually did that last weekend. I guess it makes sense to do that as much as you can before summer is over. I hope you have a nice time!
24795,"Oh my gosh, I feel the same to be honest. I hate, hate talking in front of a crowd."
24796,"I'm sure you'll be fine, just try to practice as much as possible beforehand"
24797,"I'm sorry, but that made me laugh a little bit. I've never been able to get into the idea of cats as pets just because they're so independent and determined to do whatever the want. Doesn't seem like they can listen to any direction you try to give them."
24798,"Yeah, it works for some people. I'm glad it works for you. I like my pets to be a little more needy and affectionate, but sometimes sassy can be really fun and keep things interesting and lively."
24799,That sounds exciting - where are you going!?
24800,"I love the beach, being on the Gulf Coast is probably my favorite.  I hope you have a great time!"
24801,Have you been reading reviews online?
24802,Whoa. That sounds like a very nice computer. What a surprise. That should work out pretty well.
24803,Hey! Good luck to you! That's got to be tough! 
24804,For what it's worth I'm proud of you! 
24805,That is a pretty big decision to make. Did she spring this up on you or was this something you knew she'd eventually want?
24806,I hope you can figure out a way to make things work out! Sounds like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
24807,"That profession takes a lot of courage and a unique set of skills and personality. That's pretty cool that you took that route--sometimes I think about the ""what if"" of if I took that route. Pretty sure most people have that fantasy, but only the people brave enough actually go on the path to do it, like you"
24808,"Well, at the very least, from the little that you've said, you seem very self-aware. That's a very underrated trait for people to have and to develop.. so whatever it is you decide, it seems like you'll be efficient at seeing it through. Good luck!"
24809,"Ooh, that's awesome. It's great when you can spend a little extra on the fun things."
24810,"Congratulations, I'm glad to hear you've been able to accomplish that for yourself. :)"
24811,"I always wished I could do that with my dad. But he had a stroke in his 40s, and was never in good enough health to do it with me. That and I was kind of shy and introverted, so I never made friends to do it with, either. It stinks to miss the memories, but I'm glad to hear you got to have them"
24812,"Maybe you can look forward to using it as motivation to doing those sorts of things with your kids in the future, if you choose to have them? "
24813,Just try and drive carefully then. Maybe the weather will change by then
24814,"Fantastic, was it a lot ?"
24815,Put it to some good use.
24816,Do you feel better now.
24817,Yeah. It happens to everyone whenever whether changes.
24818,Have you been studying?
24819,"Good luck, and I'm sure if you prepared well and studied hard, you'll do great!"
24820,"That's no good, what made you smoke?"
24821,"Definitely, maybe some exercise and relaxation instead?"
24822,I'm an animal lover myself. I have a cat who just had four kittens. They're adorable!
24823,Well that's very kind of you to help them out.
24824,"That's terrifying, are you okay?"
24825,"Thankful that no one was hurt, did you call the police?"
24826,"Ah, dang, did he know you were trying to buy it also?"
24827,"Well, maybe you can set a deal up with him and you can share it!"
24828,well you can improvise and make everyday household items into a gym that work just a well!
24829,yes. youtube will def have some awesome ideas . i could stand to get rid of this gut also..hahahah
24830,Oh wow! That sounds scary! I'd be mad!
24831,How annoying! That sucks.
24832,Oi...I don't like doctors or the dentists.
24833,"lol! I do not blame you, did you look up reviews?"
24834,That is a stress we all go through! It's hard!
24835,Oh no! You don't have family?
24836,"Aw, I love puppers! What kind is it?"
24837,"Aw, I'm happy for you, they are really a joy and can make your life happier!"
24838,Oh nice! Tell me about the new school?
24839,Oh thank goodness. That common core is ridiculous.
24840,Fresh socks are a treat for the feet!
24841,What does he do?
24842,"lol! My mom used to do that with books, she would read the ending first."
24843,Nope she still reads it all. Same thing you do silly! lol
24844,Oh that's great! I got my cat a new bed and she won't touch it
24845,That's so nice of you to do that for her. I have two dogs and they're picky too.
24846,"Aww, I can see how that might make you feel really bad. Was it replaceable?"
24847,"That's a real bummer. On the bright side, it taught your son that sometimes accidents happen and that's OK."
24848,oh no! that is horrible and those things always seem to happen when on your way to work or somewhere important
24849,wow that is a really expensive tire!!
24850,Woohoo! That sounds like it'll be a blast to drive!
24851,Just make sure you drive safely! :)
24852,I bet that was exciting to watch
24853,I am sure he got some things from you
24854,"Ah, I'm sorry, well you can redeem your family and be a good influence to your community!"
24855,I bet you're a great person and don't worry about the past!
24856,A good feeling about the weather?
24857,Oh how neat!  I guess you must have sensed it!
24858,That's neat!  Where did you go?
24859,Oh that sounds exciting!  I've never had the chance to go to one.
24860,"Maybe she will go easy on you, if this isn't something you do often. "
24861,"You shouldn't steal things, especially non essential things like toys. But you probably know that."
24862,"Wow, what did you do?"
24863,It is what I thought. You did good.
24864,you should probably talk to that co worker and if it doesn't stop i would report it to the HR
24865,I don't think you would make any problems. who knows maybe he is a pervert
24866,I am sorry to hear that.  Hopefully at least he is making progress
24867,That's a wonderful thing to do. What kind of tasks do you do there?
24868,"I'm sure they appreciate having people to talk to who don't judge them negatively. We have a little ""tent city"" in our neighborhood and it was just announced that they're going to be removed. That makes me sad because there is a lack of shelters."
24869,"People think that people bring it on themselves, so many have a hard time sympathizing."
24870,Temporary teeth? How long do those last?
24871,"Ah yeah, that was a pretty good idea then. Hopefully she can get some permanent ones soon!"
24872,Yikes. That is incredibly expensive for one tooth.
24873,Awesome! Congratulations! I'm sure you earned it.
24874,It's good that they appreciate you and are kind enough to reward you for your efforts!
24875,You're gonna miss the launch. What are you doing on here?
24876,Have you been playing for a long time?
24877,I've been playing since 2006.
24878,I hate to hear that. Did the person that got the job deserve it?
24879,"Well, I have faith that you will find something just as good, keep your head up and keep trying."
24880,Where are you going? Are you scared of going on the plane or going to a new place?
24881,"I'm sure you'll have a blast, I've heard it's beautiful continent. And the food will be great!"
24882,Maybe if you search some more it will go on sale. But if you really like it you should get it.
24883,Just think how happy it will make you feel each time you wear it.
24884,Ohhh I've been checking it out too!  What side are you going with?
24885,Lok'tar ogar! I love my undead necromancer! What race/class will you go with for Alliance?
24886,Oh man. That sucks. NY is really fun. Why couldn't you go?
24887,I would be kind of mad and dissappointed with him. You could have offered to pay your own way!
24888,That's pretty cool! Was it a professional game?
24889,Sounds like he's a good player! You should ask him for some tickets!
24890,Aw man. I am guessing you already went to the store. Did you have to interact with the manager?
24891,Yeah that stinks. Is it a store you go often?
24892,Congrats! I am also working hard at getting super fit too at 35! It is harder the older you are but totally doable if you're committed!
24893,So true! Building muscle is great!
24894,"Oh no, he's probably lost. Maybe you should take him in and feed him."
24895,At least you're concerned and interested in helping. Some people would ignore the poor little kitty and just let him die. Very kind of you!
24896,"If I had a huge yard, I'd probably have an entire farm house from all the stray animals I see and feel bad for! I can't help myself."
24897,That's awesome. Would have been a bummer to come home to a messy house.
24898,Well it's good that you have such a great wife! I hope you guys have an amazing life together.
24899,"Congratulations, I'm sure you will do great.  it's always nerve-racking the first day of work!"
24900,"Good luck, and have fun.  The money will just be a bonus!"
24901,Why'd you turn her down?
24902,"Well, props on you for being loyal. That shows a lot of character."
24903,I did actually.
24904,"I'm not even sure, maybe they had a deal in place with the school board?"
24905,Sounds like a promising job
24906,I know. I just went yesterday!
24907,I can't wait to move and have a hook up.
24908,"Nice, that's very convenient, do you enjoy it? "
24909,"Haha, she doesn't understand that you're at work!"
24910,"Mmmm, I love gourmet ice cream.  If I didn't have self control I would be like 800 pounds from it."
24911,"You and me both, we need to hit the gym!"
24912,"I love video games too, what's your favorite. I really like ""Don't Starve"" by Klei."
24913,"Oooh my friends have been playing that, maybe I should get it too"
24914,"Oh no, that must have been pretty awful. Do you not have self checkout at your grocery store?"
24915,"If it makes you feel any better, I bet that happens a lot to the cashier. They probably didn't think twice or care as long as you weren't a jerk."
24916,"I deal with anxiety myself, so I know not thinking about it is easier said than done. Take care of yourself and try to find a good distraction to get your mind off it!"
24917,How are they? Are you doing pretty well in that area?
24918,That is awesome! Sounds like they are finely horned then! 
24919,Fantastic! Being grateful is the way to be happy!
24920,Me too! It's good when you have caring people around.
24921,"I love dogs, what kind of puppy is it?"
24922,"I have a pit myself, they are great dogs despite what people say about them"
24923,"Yea, I enjoy stuff from my childhood. What kind of music are you listening to, country, rock, something else?"
24924,"That sounds like a really great time, I love those nostalgic feelings you get from listening to stuff from your past."
24925,"I bet! Who do you think it's going to have the most separation anxiety, you or them? Be honest!"
24926,"Well stay strong! For what it's worth, I moved schools a lot as a kid and yeah the first day is rough but kids adapt quickly. They might even make new friends right away!"
24927,That's terrible that you are being abused. Who is treating you so poorly?
24928,"If you guys are in an exclusive relationship, then that would be considered infidelity. You should leave her and focus on yourself."
24929,Whats new in the game?
24930,   Some people have no respect for otheres.
24931,Are they like 1000 level classes?  If I was in a higher class I'd of straight told them to quiet down.
24932,"Yeah you've still got some riff raff around at that level.  Man... its been a long time but, I remember those days."
24933,You should.  I ran out of patience for that stuff real fast.
24934,Thats sick. Did you report them? They are supposed to have them cleaned several times per day or they can be shut down
24935,I would as that is a serious health hazard
24936,"End of summer cleaning, I know that feeling, got to get ready for the school year!"
24937,"Ah, I can imagine, Winter's are brutal there I hear."
24938,What do you have to speak on?
24939,"My knees get weak when I try to publicly speak, it's bad."
24940,"That's nice, what kind of shoes are they? Heels?"
24941,"How fun! I love shoes, I have at least 20 or 30 pairs in the house"
24942,"Wow, I hope you do get a nice bonus. Sounds like you work pretty hard."
24943,"Well, Ill keep my fingers crossed for you."
24944,That is so awesome. Congratulations. Any big plans to celebrate?
24945,That is very exciting. 
24946,"Ugh, that is so frustrating!"
24947,That is infuriating. I know how costly healthcare is. Such a shame that we as a country cant do better.
24948,Oh god..I don't know how you military wives do it. I just can't imagine
24949,I would be the same. I am a one person kind of gal. I don't do that even when I am single. The worry though must be hard!
24950,That sounds so sweet.  What was the occasion?
24951,I would be jealous of their strong love for one another.
24952,Where are they headed?
24953,Some free time to yourself! Maybe you can catch up on some guilty pleasures haha
24954,"lol! I bet, how old are they?"
24955,Ohhh! Those times are nice. I only have a partner but I know I love my quiet mornings and my morning routine :)
24956,"Aw, that's cute, how old is he/she?"
24957,"Oh wow, that's adorable.  I'm sure its very fragile and cute, wish I could see it!"
24958,"That sucks, do you plan on getting a new one?"
24959,"You should, my Ipad has great charge time."
24960,"That's always a good feeling.  If you don't feel confident going in, you're in trouble!"
24961,"Ahhh, Calculus, I had a pretty hard time with that as well, some how I got a B and to be honest, I don't even know it."
24962,"Aww, that's sad. I love any and all animals, I'm sorry"
24963,"It can be tough losing a pet, keep your head up"
24964,Are you going to keep them
24965,That does sound very frustrating
24966,Oh how did it go?
24967,"Oh nice, what was the person like?"
24968,What movie did you end up watching?
24969,"Jennifer Lawrence is one of my favorite actors, would you recommend it?"
24970,Oh nice! Where did you buy it?
24971,Sounds like you're looking real sharp :)
24972,What does she like to eat?
24973,Well that is step in the right direction at least
24974,I'm sorry to hear that. Were you close?
24975,"At least, bonds that tight mean they will always be a part of you someway. "
24976,It is nice to enjoy life 
24977,"I am glad you are happy, its a great feeling to have"
24978,"That is terrible, I am sorry for your loss..."
24979,I understand that completely
24980,What team?
24981,Well I wish you the best of luck!
24982,That's awesome I'm happy for you. What is she like?
24983,"Awh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends at school? "
24984,"Well, hopefully y'all will still be able to keep in touch."
24985,"You must be so proud, when did you find out?"
24986,Wow amazing! Do you enjoy motherhood?
24987,Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Did you tell her?
24988,Mistakes happen. I'm sure everyone has broken something that belongs to someone else at some point in their lives!
24989,Awe.. I'm sorry.   I know how you must feel. I've got a dog myself.
24990,Attleast the suffering is over.
24991,Are you going to get another doggo?
24992,Time heals all wounds.
24993,"You must be excited, what kind of work will you do?"
24994,"That is for sure, but that should be cool, how much does it cost?"
24995,That is not too bad I would do it for that
24996,That must have been quite lonely.  How are you doing now?
24997,That is good.  Hopefully things keep getting better in the future.
24998,"Congratulations! I hope you do, it's always nerve-racking when it comes to the interview and whether or not your get it."
24999,"You got this! I have faith, and sending positive vibes your way!"
25000,Why did you move into  that apartment complex then?
25001,Yikes. Just don't go wantering around at night and keep your doors locke.d
25002,"Are you saying that a drunk guy hit your car, and that it is very bad? If so, that really sucks and I am sorry. Did he have insurance?"
25003,Were the police able to help? That sounds like a big mess!
25004,Did you find anything interesting?
25005,Good luck. When are they supposed to reply?
25006,"Oh wow thats great, how do you like it so far?"
25007,"Gosh, that's too bad! Maybe continue to work there but looks apply for new jobs. Good Luck!"
25008,What might be wrong?
25009,I hope everything comes back clean for you?
25010,"I'm not too familiar with football, who is their star player?"
25011,"Interesting, maybe I'll check them out this season"
25012,Who is coming?
25013,"Oh, well that should be a lot of fun!"
25014,What are you happy about
25015,Those are all important things in life
25016,It sounds like you were very prepared!! Good job!
25017,"Yes you did, it will definitely pay off!"
25018,I guess it can be a learning experience
25019,No its not fair at all
25020,The whole week?
25021,Cool. Are you gona go anywhere special...
25022,Cats can be odd creatures
25023,They do. I have one and he is a great companion
25024,"Yeah, summer is a great season, have you been on vacation at all?"
25025,That's great! I went on a nice trip too
25026,"Oh, that was very nice"
25027,I like to do that for people when they don't expect it or when they need it most
25028,Careful. Lightning never strikes twice.
25029,"In any case, good luck!"
25030,"That is awesome, enjoy the peace and quiet!"
25031,I am sure you have haha
25032,How drunk was he?
25033,"Oh, yeah I get it though, you do not get paid to babysit"
25034,Was it an accident
25035,It was just an accident. There will always be another tv
25036,Me too! This heat is unbearable! What is your favorite thing about fall?
25037,I cannot wait to sit on the porch with hot chocolate with the cool breeze coming through! Just a few more months!
25038,"Oh no, did you get it back"
25039,"Oh no, I am sorry. Maybe he will come back"
25040,Did you have someone come in to spray it? You can ask for a refund maybe
25041,Oh that's a good idea. What kind of bugs do you have?
25042,I have been there. It can be irritating
25043,Maybe you will get it next year
25044,check out some vids on youtube. im sure you will be fine!
25045,oh yea i can understand that
25046,That most have been really nice. What did you do?
25047,That sounds like it was a really good time!
25048,"Good for you!  I know that can be difficult, but it will pay off in the end"
25049,That's really something to be proud of.  Keep it up!
25050,"Congratulations. What a wonderful achievement. If I could do it all over again, this is what I'd want to do too."
25051,"Don't look back. Go forth, and be brave."
25052,what did you do with them?
25053,ah thats always nice to do every once in a while.
25054,Some jerk ding your car in the parking lot?
25055,... and i bet they didn't even leave a note or anything.
25056,It sounds like you had a really good time!
25057,It's always a good place to be when you are content.
25058,Those guys and girls tend to work hard
25059,Its nice to find good work out there
25060,Thats great! How did you do it?
25061,Soda definitely can make you pack on some pounds! Keep up the healthy lifestyle!
25062,I hope your okay! Do you think you have food poising?
25063,"Oh I see, make sure to look at expriatian date next time :)"
25064,"I'm so sorry to hear that, it's always tough to lose a pet. "
25065,"Oh wow, that must be tough. I'd like to think they were having trouble dealing with it themselves and that's why they didn't tell you right away."
25066,What is in Asheville?
25067,Oh that sounds very fun.
25068,What kind of cereal was it
25069,Well that sounds disgusting
25070,That is horrible.  Is it still under warranty or anything like that?
25071,That is a rip off honestly!  I don't think I'd buy that brand again.
25072,I can imagine you do. Do you have a needle fear? Even if you dont they still hurt
25073,Oh wow I would be mad. Is there any other provider who could get you in faster? 
25074,Congratulations on working up the nerve to fly! Did you enjoy the flight?
25075,That's awesome! It's always nice to overcome a fear!
25076, Are you going to ride roller coasters
25077,Oh that's awful. Did it happen in a parking lot maybe?
25078,That's the worst and it has happened to me before too. Hopefully it's not too big of a dent.
25079,did you all have some drinks together
25080,That's really great that you have an amazing partner like him!
25081,That's great! I hope you two have a great life.
25082,what kind of dog whas Rusty?
25083,that is awesome. we all deserve to have an amazing dog as a kid
25084,i'm sorry he is no longer with you but at least you have great memories of him
25085,did you get a suprise party?
25086,oh yea thats always nice.
25087,"I bet you were, but I am sure you had a good reason."
25088,That's too bad. I am sure your son understood though.
25089,I have the same tub sitting in the attic. I have no idea what to do with all the photos! Are you creating collages or albums?
25090,awwww I would probably cry too! Scanning them seems like it would take forever. Maybe see if there is a company you can send them to and they'll do it for you.
25091,too hot outside?
25092,yea yes that is a nice time of the year
25093,Where were you coming from?...and how cheap was it?
25094,That's a steal.
25095,what was it ? lightening perhaps
25096,you must have some crystal clear windows 
25097,"That's tough, is there anyone else there that can help you?"
25098,"Wow that sounds really physically demanding, you must be quite strong."
25099,Oh yuck! I hate flies. 
25100,Haha what was the drink? 
25101,It's never too late for some late summer cleaning!
25102,Sounds like it.  Are you going to sleep better tonight knowing its clean?
25103,Good to hear :)
25104,I love to play videogames. What did you play?
25105,That is a very good game
25106,How come? Do you not live with them anymore?
25107,Wow that's awesome! Any special reason why?
25108,Congratulations on that! It's a great feeling for sure.
25109,I hope everything goes well but I'm sure it will. Don't worry.
25110,"Well stress will cause more health problems, just keep that in mind when you start to worry."
25111,"I hope it goes well, are you sick?"
25112,"Oh wow, hopefully you can get some answers to ease your mind."
25113,oh yea sounds like a great time of the year
25114,go play bingo!
25115,That is definitely scary. What happened next?
25116,"That's funny, I was thinking almost the same thing."
25117,It's a shame that the present never seems capable of competing with the past.
25118,What do you think about
25119,Those are nice memories
25120,That's how many cups of coffee I had this morning! Did you have coffee too?
25121,"Oh, yeah that does start next month! I guess I know what my husband will be doing on Sundays hahaha"
25122,"Sounds like a plan, I hope she is around for years to come"
25123,"That is precious, animals are something special, that is for sure"
25124,Are you a big Eagles fan?
25125,"What is a lathe, I am not familiar with it"
25126,"Oh okay, that is interesting, I will need to look into that, sounds awesome to me!"
25127,Are you a big eagles fan?
25128,Haha! I lived in Alabama until recently so professional football is something I'm distant from.
25129,There's nothing worse! What was wrong with it?
25130,Did you take it to a shop?
25131,Did you have to miss work?
25132,"Oh no, that does sound so gross"
25133,Yeah it needs to be clean in there for sure
25134,I've never seen them. What do you love about them?
25135,Hmm I may have to check them out then! 
25136,"Wow, congrats to them. Are you worried you will loose your roommate? "
25137,Can you afford it?
25138,That sound like it was a bit rash.
25139,"Yeah, but now they're looking for him instead of the real crook."
25140,"i dont have kids , but i feel the same way u do if i had kids that is"
25141,"thats the way it should be , they are the future"
25142,ah well at least you didnt feel lonely
25143,Was anything missing?
25144,"Oh no, are they okay"
25145,It's okay. There's always Wednesday service or online sermons you can watch.
25146,I wouldn't feel so bad about missing one day!
25147,i don't know if i could make it thru a scary movie. it gets me too scared.
25148,i can't imagine even trying to deal. you are braver than i am for sure.
25149,I hope everything goes well for you.
25150,Good luck and try to think about something else before then.
25151,I have seen the previews. Is it good?
25152,Murder can be interesting I guess
25153,What were you expecting?
25154,it almost rained on me when I was walking home today.
25155,That's unfortunate.  You must have been lonely.  Has your situation improved since then?
25156,Wow.. that's... sad.
25157,Can you go back and get it ?
25158,"Might be worth it, rather than someone else picking it up."
25159,"WHAT, did you catch them?"
25160,damn you should have hunted them down
25161,It might have been the same person! We should stake out in the bushes out there and see who it was!
25162,We'll get Taco Bell and eat tacos all night and when we catch them we'll make them watch us eat the tacos and not share with them. 
25163,Oh nice! What was the occasion?
25164,Happy birthday! Did you have fun at your party?
25165,"Oh wow, do you have a backup job lined up?"
25166,3rd time the charm?
25167,Some people know they can do better so they shop around I guess.
25168,I guess. Or it could be they are ready to move on but need to know someone else will be interested in them.
25169,I would have screamed!
25170,"When a cockroach comes in my house, the neighborhood knows it."
25171,Oh yeah I can see how it could be lonely. It's so quiet when they are gone.
25172,Yeah it is like an imbalance in the house somehow.
25173,I don't do haunted houses lol
25174,I would have dies
25175,Are you proud of her?
25176,What is she most talented at in school?
25177,Never fun when someone tried to change your schedule. Life's unfair sometimes.
25178,Well hopefully you were able to get some overtime pay.
25179,I hate it. I want it to be 100 and humid all the time. I thrive in the heat
25180,Disconnect from what? Did you have a bad day?
25181,"Nice, how much do you bench?"
25182,"I see,  how many years have you been playing football/what kind of goals do you have?"
25183,"That's so cool, what is his name?"
25184,whats the dogs name ? what kind is it
25185,oh those are nice loyal dogs.
25186,What are they getting treatment for
25187,I hope you guys get through it
25188,Just say some prayers and be positive
25189,"What did they help them with, just how to do certain moves?"
25190,"Yes, some are really good at helping others lose weight and feel good"
25191,That is very kind. Now many people like that.
25192,You will have to return the favor sometime. 
25193,Do you usually sleep in? I heard it's better to wake up naturally.
25194,Well maybe you will be able to start a new habit of waking up without it.
25195,I sure do! What are some of your favorites?
25196,"Oh yeah those will do that. I still have like 40 of them on VCR or video cassette, whatever those things were called. i doubt I would be able to find one these days that would actually play them@"
25197,How did you guys end up meeting?
25198,"That makes sense, when did you first meet up in person?"
25199,what did you see?
25200,i hear that movie is great
25201,That would be a dream
25202,That is a place I have always wanted to go to
25203,What happened to him ?
25204,Was he in a dangerous area ?
25205,"thats great to hear, im happy for you and your accomplishements "
25206,hope your future is bright 
25207,That's great! Good for you!
25208,That must feel really good. I bet your parents are proud!
25209,"What is her name, you seem so lucky."
25210,"Oh that's always tough, are you nervous?"
25211,"I can understand, if you try to think positively it might help"
25212,When will it be released? I have not heard of that one.
25213,I am sure you will have a lot of fun when it comes out.
25214,"Have you checked your lease agreement, they may be required by law to follow through."
25215,"Yeah, I would show up at the office and show them exactly where they promised to take care of you. That should work."
25216,I'm sorry but I'm so not a fan of meatloaf. Do you have a good recipe?
25217,"Hmm that might actually be good, I think it's the ketchup that I don't like about meatloaf. Bon appetit!"
25218,Did you sneak away from them?
25219,who did she beat down?
25220,"oh, lay the smack down     "
25221,yeah that's a bad habit. I don't like it either.
25222,"lol, he is just like my brother. You should ignore him, just like I ignore my borther"
25223,"That's impressive, how did you do?"
25224,I don't think I could do it.
25225,I keep forgetting that football season is right around the corner. Did you play when you were younger?
25226,Spending time with your parents and watching games can create great memories! 
25227,Wow... I kinda hope they get fired. Why did you need to talk to the landlord?
25228,Are you okay with that
25229,Have you talked to her about it
25230,"Awh, I'm sorry. What happened?"
25231,Well at least you know what to do next time. I'm sure you'll rock it then!
25232,What church do you go to?
25233,"I haven't been lately, did you do a confession?"
25234,What hate did he get
25235,Oh I do not like them
25236,That's awesome that you were so prepared!
25237,I hope that you get rewarded for you hard work!
25238,"Oh no, those are so gross"
25239,That is never a good thing
25240,"That's so awful, what is your dogs name?"
25241,what ended up happening
25242,How long have you been working for the company?
25243,I think you will do okay! Get as much rest as possible tonight just in case they do an interview!
25244,That is indeed a bummer. Maybe you can pick some up on a ticket trading website?
25245,Seriously. It ruins it for the real fans.
25246,Maybe you should go somewhere else
25247,Yeah you would think they would be good by now
25248,"i have never been to church , but i understand where your coming from"
25249,"maybe one day ill go , its just the way i was brought up religion was not something my family made me follow "
25250,That must've been awful.
25251,How old was she when she passed?
25252,They really are. What is your favorite
25253,Those are good too. I never saw that one
25254,"Ooh congratulations, what for? "
25255,Best of luck with that raise. Congrats to you!
25256,i hope you enjoy art class that was always my favorite.
25257,Oh no! Who is Matty?
25258,Oh my.. I am so sorry. I hope you find her soon!
25259,Do you live in a bad area or a big city?
25260,Your safe in the woods. Most animals are more scared of you. What scared you?
25261,If you have to leave just be very careful on the road.
25262,Leave early and drive slower than normal. Just watch out for other drivers.
25263,What kind of job is it
25264,That sounds like a good one
25265,What kind of animal is it?
25266,"Wow that's so cool, those are a type of reptile right?"
25267,when does it come out? i wanna get that too and the new online service
25268,ah that sounds about right
25269,"Yeah, that's definitely not OK. Have you thought about contacting a tenants rights group to advocate on your behalf?"
25270,In some cases you can even legally withhold rent if they aren't doing their duty as a landlord. I'd definitely check out what you can do!
25271,That sounds very dangerous
25272,That would help a lot
25273,That's great. I bet he worked hard for it.
25274,I am happy for him! It is always nice to see people reaching their goals.
25275,"i need to start playing too , that would be awesome"
25276,"it would be a great life , hope you do eventually win"
25277,never seen it. dont like scary movies much
25278,I'm sorry to hear that! What's stopping you from taking the trip?
25279,"Well, hopefully you can make arrangements to take the trip another time. It's hard to find a new job!"
25280,I guess that means they were good at least
25281,That sounds like a good idea
25282,Are you looking forward to it or nah?
25283,Well good. Then good luck tomorrow and knock 'em dead!
25284,did he get you there?
25285,You sound like a good person then. What kind of pet is it
25286,That sounds very exotic
25287,"That's good, did you use one of those car buying services or something?"
25288,Did you end up getting a good deal?
25289,Oh I
25290,I'll bet you were really glad when that flight was over!
25291,That's cool!  I love animals
25292,"I don't like spiders so much, but I do really like snakes. "
25293,I didn't understand. What happened?
25294,I am sorry you had to hear that
25295,I guess just pray about it and surround yourself with positive people
25296,"never seen it, is it that scary?"
25297,"ah, maybe i need to check it out"
25298,What will you do next?
25299,Have you found a house yet?
25300,You have tornadoes?
25301,That's a good thing to have
25302,Did she pass away?
25303,I'm sorry to hear that. Cancer is horrible. I can't wait till they find a cure.
25304,Where did he end up flying too?
25305,"That's a long trip, do you have anything you can do to keep yourself occupied?"
25306,how is he doing?
25307,well he has a good sibling!
25308,Why did you miss it
25309,Well you cant help that sometimes
25310,"Oh you're good then, even beat up Camrys are great cars that last forever!"
25311,Its good to have supportive siblings like you
25312,"I am sure you did, and I am sure he notices"
25313,Are you gojng to meet them again?
25314,"Good, I wish you the best of luck with it, may you find love!"
25315,"I hate the dentist, they poke and prod so much."
25316,"I had braces growing up too, the worst part for me was the molding!"
25317,Like a stick shift car? You got some pretty rich friends!
25318,"Oh lol.  I hear those are expensive too, so, you got some rich friends! Lol"
25319,I bet that was a nice deal to find
25320,I hope you have fun there then
25321,were you able to make use of all the equipment
25322,Wow that's great! She still has to pass the bar though right?
25323,"Wow that's impressive, I'm sure with that determination she'll pass easily."
25324,That's the worst!  People need to be more considerate and clean up after their dogs
25325,I agree completely.  People shouldn't have to watch every single step they take just to avoid stepping in it.
25326,You actually stole them?
25327,Well that was nice of you
25328,?
25329,It always scares me too when my power goes off. I'll nearly break my toe hitting it on walls and furniture trying to light a candle lol
25330,oh thats sweet. did he like it?
25331,wow that was mighty nice of you
25332,Why were you upset
25333,"Oh, well I wonder how he will pay for that then"
25334,Did you like it? I never liked it!
25335,"Yeah I agree, those days will never come back!"
25336,Oh no!  That's awful.  How did they manage that?
25337,At least he apologized.  That makes it a little bit easier to deal with
25338,Amen to that! Mine start wednesday and Friday!
25339,good memories?
25340,the good ole days 
25341,"Ugh, that is disgusting.  I'm guessing it wasn't your own?"
25342,"I bet.  It would be bad enough it was just spit, but the tobacco amps it up to 11.  It would be nice if people had enough respect for others not to do that sort of stuff."
25343,That should solve the problem!
25344,Would you be making more money?
25345,Well sometimes you have to spread your wings and leave the nest!
25346,Its a good time to branch out then
25347,There is nothing to be scared of
25348,Has it been rainy there?
25349,"It's been the same way here, just rain rain rain."
25350,"Ohh, how did you get that?"
25351,ohh cool. I am happy for you
25352,"wow, i did not see that coming.     on to the next one!"
25353,"ohh, nice. Where did you guys go?"
25354,Cool. I like classic italian pizza
25355,Why did you feel ruined?
25356,What did your leaders say about it?
25357,"I haven't, did you enjoy it?"
25358,"Interesting, maybe I'll check it out."
25359,Man that really stinks. I hope that you are ok!
25360,Oh no well at least you aren't hurt
25361,Do you want to get one now?
25362,I assume your dad has passed?
25363,I'm sorry to hear that.  My parents are getting older... I don't even want to think about that yet.
25364,"Oh nice, I never got into those games"
25365,It's OK we all get jealous sometimes. What did you envy about your best friend?
25366,"Don't sweat it! I am sure with hard work and determination, you will land a good job too!"
25367,Oh wow! Have you been looking for it for a long time?
25368,Well I'm glad you found it! I know you had to be happy about that!
25369,Those were the good old days. I wish I could go back to being that age even for just a day!
25370,Did he buy 600 pizzas? lol
25371,That's good. I let my daughter go school shooping alon and she spent ten dollars on one shirt. I ended up buying everything myself
25372,Way to go. You will be glad you did that in the future.
25373,That market has been really lately so you should see it grow. 
25374,Awesome! Have they upgraded it any or does it look the same?
25375,"Oh wow, I bet it felt very nostalgic. Almost like being in a time machine."
25376,How exciting. Kid's grow up to fast.
25377,My favorite sport. Is this his first year playing?
25378,oh yea ? does it pay well
25379,hah.. you get used to it.
25380,"Holy cow, that IS impressive.  I can't believe people can eat that much.  Was he in a contest?"
25381,Ohhhh my goodness.  He deserves it for free if he can down 4 pounds of food.
25382,"Eww, I've had that happen. Did you say something to the person showing you the apartment?"
25383,Wow that's revolting. I'd report it to the health department!
25384,You are so lucky. They must bring you great joy.
25385,That is amazing. I am sure they appreciate you too.
25386,Wonderful!  It always feels so good to be prepared and ready to crush an interview.  I bet you'll get the job because of that preparation and confidence.
25387,Awesome!  Let me congratulate you ahead of time cause you've got this!  
25388,im with you there
25389,Oh no! Do you have any pets that could get out?
25390,That's terrible! Hopefully they'll come back home. I'd be whooping somebody if I found out who did it!
25391,That's great. Do you think the rest of the week will be as great?
25392,Lucky you. Are you always a positive person or it's just been an amazing week really?
25393,Oh yeah?  I hope you did well?
25394,Are you excited to move out?
25395,Where is the house located?
25396,You must be really glad to have them.  Did they do something nice for you recentyl?
25397,That is really great.  Hold on to those good friends.
25398,Where would you like to vacation too?
25399,"That sounds amazing, going to do some camping?"
25400,Did anything or anyone escape
25401,"Oh no, did you get them back"
25402,what did you learn
25403,"Oh no, I hate to hear that. What were they trying to sell?"
25404,I'm sorry about that.
25405,Yeah they always seem to grow up so fast. 
25406,Yeah but just think. The best is yet to come!
25407,What do you guys do for work together?
25408,"That's awesome, do you make enough to afford your payments?"
25409,Oh no!  That's not your journey then.  Do you have other places you applied?
25410,I'm so sorry.  I know it must be tough right now but it is happening for a reason.  Make your dreams happen no matter where it is! 
25411,Why did you cancel?
25412,"Oh, that makes sense, I am sure they understand"
25413,That is a beautiful thing
25414,Really?  Are you scared by lots of movies?
25415,Awwww... That's cute.  
25416,"Oh I am sorry to hear that, how old was it?"
25417,"Oh, well that is a long time, but a stronger bond as well"
25418,Who left it open?
25419,Did you complain to their customer service?
25420,oh wow im sorry to hear that. glad to hear they got a good friend
25421,i hope they get well
25422,Are you serious? You dont deserve that.
25423,Thats rough. Im sure you will be better in the long run. 
25424,What songs were on it?
25425,"Oh baby that sounds like fun to me, I loved old eminem."
25426,"Oh, I am sorry to hear that"
25427,What is going so great?
25428,Tell me about it.
25429,Oh no! I hate when that happens! Did you turn off your alarm in your sleep?
25430,It happens to me more than I like to admit lol
25431,Its always nice to find clothes that fit well
25432,"Yeah, if you find a brand you like, stick with it"
25433,Have you won before?
25434,Really? That is enough to retire if you know how to manage it!
25435,you know what they say about chip kelly?
25436,f chip kelly
25437,"Haha I know exactly what you mean! My uncle pranked his coworker once with a bag of sugar free candy. I feel for you, seriously."
25438,Oh man that is really bad. I feel sorry for laughing. 
25439,That's a great feeling I love mine as well.
25440,"That's impressive, she sounds amazing."
25441,Oh no!  Are you itching all over now? 
25442,That's good.  I hope it gets better soon :(
25443,Where is it taking place?
25444,"Oh wow, that is a huge life event then, best of luck?"
25445,They are making another one? Those games were always so successful.
25446,That is so cool. I might have to get a Switch.
25447,yea that sucks.. feeling those cars zoom by you
25448,well at least you lived to tell us about it!
25449,What did you miss because of work?
25450,I'm sorry that's awful I bet he's sad.
25451,That is awesome!  I know how hard it is to lose weight.  She  must be so happy.
25452,I feel you.  That's how my body functions too. Slow weight loss or not at all.  Its also dangerous to lose weight too quickly so don't wish it for yourself too fast.  Slowly and steadily keeps you from getting lose skin or gaining it all back too. 
25453,"I used to have the same problem, I'd always hear a bunch of spooky noises after everyone left."
25454,I worked night shift alone in an office and I'd always hear foot steps in the hallway 
25455,"That is very nice, what movie did you see?"
25456,Oh really? Did you recover?
25457,That is a scary feeling
25458,Did you go to your mechanic for maintenance?
25459,Did you report them to anyone
25460,I am sorry you went through thaty
25461,you should be!
25462,wow thats great!
25463,What do you have planned for next weekend?
25464,What does that mean?
25465,Those things are gross
25466,They are not normal animals for sure
25467,"That's understandable, companionship is great. Do you think you will seek one soon?"
25468,"Yea definitely, but only if you feel inclined."
25469,"I know what you mean! I got caught out in it by surprise, totally ruined my bike ride."
25470,"Yeah, lightning is no joke. Hopefully you have better weather this weekend and can get out!"
25471,Did they win their preseason game? 
25472,That's great if they quaterback is good and have a good defense they got it.
25473,What do you have planned?
25474,"That's going to be fun, little catch and release?"
25475,Heck yeah that's awesome!  Did you celebrate with him
25476,Did you pick up at least 95% of the tab? lol
25477,have you gone to the doctor?
25478,that sucks. i hope it turns out well for you
25479,"The week just started, ha ha.  Do you have some fun plans?"
25480,"Awesome, my brother-in-law does that.  He loves it.  Hope its beautiful weather for you!"
25481,"oh thats cool, what are you going to study"
25482,Were you in a bad part of town?
25483,That is scary! You be careful!
25484,"Wow, what a stroke of luck! Who did you such a solid?"
25485,That's so very fortunate! There are still some kind-hearted people out there after all.
25486,Nothing feels worse than losing time to work when you should be free.
25487,Hopefully they at least paid you overtime.
25488,"That is awesome, too bad it will not be small forever!"
25489,What type of job are you applying for?
25490,"I bet you are, but don't worry you got this!"
25491,"Well, you are supposed to tell me about something that made you feel a certain way.  Please share."
25492,That's great!  Having a job is a big deal - and I'm sure it was a blessing after not having one for three years!!  Congrats to you!
25493,i bet that was very nice sounds like a nice family you have i bet you are so happy
25494,lol  she will get better 
25495,I feel you have you tried setting a schedule or is it from lack of rest.
25496,You may need a vacation or take a little break you don't want to overwork or wear your body down to much.
25497,what kind of buisiness are you running?
25498,hrmmm .. seems interesting. hopefully legal.
25499,Is it a lizard?
25500,Oh lord! That's kind of scary
25501,That's interesting I have a tv by my couch as well. You have good taste.
25502,Oh I didn't realize your brother had control of it because he slept there. Hopefully he finds another spot more comfy.
25503,Were able to save any of it
25504,It happens to all of us
25505,"Hopefully he is ok, did they find anything wrong?"
25506,"That's pretty scary, hopefully they can get him some meds and he gets to come home."
25507,That's so exciting! How did it go?
25508,That is amazing! You must feel pretty proud of her.
25509,oh wow i didnt even know they go for that long. i hope all goes well for you all!
25510,well is he going back?
25511,Oh no.  What happened?  Is your dog okay?
25512,"Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I assume you don't have a Chip implanted to track it? That's awful, I'd be furious!"
25513,Wow that would scare me too. What caused it?
25514,Sorry to hear that you're in that situation. Hope you stay safe
25515,Oh no! Is she stressed about something?
25516,"Ahh, that could be it. Sometimes when my cat is stressed she poops or throws up."
25517,That's awesome. Maybe you have natural talent for it and should try to become a singer!
25518,You could always post videos to social media in your spare time and see how well received it is. Many people have made it big starting out that way.
25519,"Oh no,what happened?"
25520,"That is so sad, I hope you find him."
25521,how long is grad school?
25522,"thats not bad, good luck"
25523,Hey good for you!  Plenty of good boys and girls there?
25524,Yeah but at least they get to see you often so you can give them some love and pets!
25525,"That's awesome!  Keep up the good work, my friend :D"
25526,That's so awesome!
25527,Is it acting crazy or just not working?
25528,"You could name it Bob Marley since it's always ""jammin"" lol I couldn't resist"
25529,"Record it and have a ""Office Space"" moment with it lol"
25530,How did you meet them?
25531,It's always nice to go somewhere you can meet a lot of new people.
25532,"I would be too, were you in a shopping center?"
25533,People are so careless.
25534,how old is he
25535,"I have never even heard of that movie, but I'm sure it would scare me.  I have never watched a horror movie in my life, and I won't"
25536,"Yeah, I get scared easily by everyday things I don't need to help my imagination along.  What do you do to keep yourself from thinking about it?"
25537,What did you say>
25538,"That is nasty, but some people just do not care"
25539,I would love to play with you sometime.
25540,What team is that?
25541,"Oh, I am sorry to hear that "
25542,What makes you say that?
25543,I bet it felt really good to let that all out and to still be accepted by her.
25544,did you give her stuff back
25545,she knows it was you?
25546,Good luck for this weekend.
25547,That happened to me a couple months ago. It was a brand new tire which really sucked
25548,Was there construction going on near your house? Someone had done work on my roof and I think maybe the nail in my tire came from there.
25549,Well Happy Birthday!  Did you have a nice time?
25550,Oh no!  I hope you feel better now and that you had a good time while you were on the trip at least.
25551,I do. Why do you say that about her?
25552,That's terrible. Her kids are going to resent her.
25553,Were you alone?
25554,"I don't blame you, I would be scared too.  It seems like you got home alright though, so that is good."
25555,thats cool. what kind of car are you getting
25556,oh wow!
25557,"I am so sorry to hear that. She might be hard to be around, but I hope you spend some time with her."
25558,wow. congratualations. do you think she is expecting it?
25559,what is the plan?
25560,Most people are dreading it. How come you're looking forward to it?
25561,Oh yea! Congratulations!
25562,"What made you come to that decision, I get angry when people leave carts close to others cars. "
25563,Maybe it was a honest mistake then since she was elderly I see why you didn't want to give her up. 
25564,That's not good. Procrastination can lead to a lot of stress.
25565,Hopefully she will learn quickly that it's better to get her school work done quickly
25566,Dang! Ask her out!
25567,"Alright alright, you can go the slow route"
25568,"That is amazing!  So many people do not stay married these days, you should be proud of that accomplishment!"
25569,It's 100% for both of you!  It takes two to tango you know - Congrats on 35 years!
25570,That is not fun.  Do the police have any leads?
25571,That is a good thing.  Have you thought about getting a camera and posting that you have one on the property.
25572,Oh no.  That is pretty bad.  Do you know who she is that you could go and leave her a tip? Mistakes happen and there's not much you can do.
25573,Oh man that's terrible :(  I'm so sorry. 
25574,Yeah.  My grandmother was like that too.  The backbone of the family.  We all went our separate ways pretty much after she died.  Don't let that happen to your family!
25575,That's great to hear! Will you be in the ceremony?
25576,I'm so happy for you! I am sure it will be a wonderful day for both of you!
25577,Ut oh.. what is your favorite?  I like so many I can't pick just one.
25578,I haven't tried that one yet  I will now.  I love blueberries.. and I like chex.
25579,Why is he in the ICU?
25580,"I'm sorry, I hope he recovers!"
25581,What does that mean? A raise at work?
25582,oh. congratulations!
25583,you should hook up with somebody then!!
25584,it is not!! but you got to give it a try
25585,That really stinks. You didn't go with them?
25586,"Ah. Well, I suppose it's a good thing you didn't know him. Less heartache for you, I suppose."
25587,"That's great, how do you feel about it?"
25588,Congratulations then.  What kind of job is it?
25589,Congratulations on that. You truly did it. Age is just a number. I hope you have your whole life ahead of you yet
25590,"it is almost over. Senior year is the final one and it will pass quickly. Been there, done that"
25591,You will. Being prepared always helps
25592,Thats right. I think you got it already. You know exactly what to do
25593,That is true for some
25594,If you love each other and stay close you will be fine.
25595,"I agree.  That happened to me and I had to stop watching them.  I worry too much about it happening to me or, even worse, my kids."
25596,I know. Hearing statistics doesn't help either.  Crazy people doing things every 3 seconds.
25597,Some men are such animals. Is she very attractive?
25598,"Dang, that must have been difficult to clean up, what did you eat after that?"
25599,"Ramen, ah you must be in college?"
25600,I bet that is kind of sad to see it go.
25601,Where will the current students of that school go?
25602,That's nice to hear! What's going on in your life?
25603,So many people just want more and more. I think you got it right.
25604,i hope it will come better and it will!!
25605,you must have been very careful with the do'd and don'ts!!
25606,Oh no. Accidents happen. I feel really sorry for the dog.
25607,Did you go back?
25608,Dang that Sara!  Did you tell her how unhappy you were with her?
25609,Yeah I understand.  Maybe you should pay her back somehow.
25610,Put sugar in her salt shaker next time you're at her house :D
25611,LOL.  Good luck!  Glad you made it home safe :)
25612,Oh no...what did you do? 
25613,Yes. I LOVE EGGPLANT! How could  you find that really gross? 
25614,"Hahaha, well to each their own, because I love how eggplant is mushy. "
25615,"Yeah, and I don't think you can ever go wrong with deep fried food. Anything deep fried is delicious :D "
25616,That's really good! Is he very smart?
25617,I wish the best for your son. I am sure he will do well wherever he goes.
25618,Are you confident you will pass?
25619,Well you got this then
25620,Everything happens for a reason
25621,"Right, nothing can take that awy"
25622,I used to like watching scary movies. Not my thing anymore.
25623,Maybe you can talk yourself out of it?
25624,Im sorry to hear that
25625,Thats a good way to think about it
25626,I'm sorry to hear that. Why did you miss seeing her?
25627,"aw no. Maybe you should tell her that, so next time she'll come when you have time?"
25628,"I bet they will be a lot better, I heard vegetarian helps a lot with that."
25629,"The only negative effect I've read is the lack of protein, but I'm sure there are substitutes!"
25630,"OH goodness!  I'm glad you are ok, what happened?"
25631,WOW!  That person needs to loose their license I believe - you are so blessed you were not hurt.
25632,Congratulations!  Marriages take work but it is totally worth it when you have a good partner.  Did you do anything special for the anniversary?
25633,"I've never been on one either, but that sounds like so much fun.  Have a good time!"
25634,Why is he not asleep? 
25635,He will learn with age.
25636,In a school zone? thats not good
25637,oh why!! do you guys support separate teams!!
25638,poor him !! you should have bee angry or furious!!
25639,What kind of cancer?
25640,You gotta have some faith.
25641,"That is horrible, but I've been there myself.  It's hard to not be upset about it."
25642,"I know what you mean, it is hard.  The only advice I have is that God is always there even when no one else is."
25643,I miss my dad.. been so long.   What did you guys talk about?
25644,my mom had Alzheimers.. it sucks!
25645,Me either! Do you have any plans?
25646,That's sounds like a blast! I've never been courageous enough to attempt that.
25647,What prompted you to do that?  Did you tell someone and clear your conscience?
25648,Best thing you can do is tell the truth and clear it up. Its not worth it and you only cheat yourself.  You can do it and you'll feel better.
25649,oh that so sad!! Did you try searching him everywhere!!
25650,omg !! you would have been devastated!!
25651,That is too bad. Are they okay?
25652,Oh that is horrible! I cannot imagine what he must be going through!
25653,How come? What year did you join?
25654,"Oh that's nice, yeah it's a good feature of Facebook"
25655,Cool. Are you in charge?
25656,Sounds like a lot of work ahead
25657,"I'm sorry you don't feel well, is it a cold or something more serious?"
25658,I hope you feel better before this big meeting - or maybe you can reschedule it or something.
25659,"I love cruise, I go on at least one every year."
25660,Legs weak arms are heavy?
25661,oh.
25662,"That's great, what job is it?"
25663,I have never met someone who has done that for a job.
25664,Are you a birthday clown?
25665,Wanna invest in a clown?
25666,Do you feel bad for teasing him?
25667,"Yeah, it's funny how drastically people can change as they grow."
25668,"Did you get a chance to talk to them yet, and introduce yourself?"
25669,Have you considered getting back at them by pranking them?
25670,That's so awesome!  Are they adopting domestically or abroad?  My husband and I tried to adopt from Japan but our paperwork expired before we could and then I got pregnant. I hope it goes well for them!
25671,It will be so worth it when that child is in their arms!  I'm so happy for them and the child they are saving!
25672,"What do you think you are going to do, are you going to talk to him and find out?"
25673,Or you could find out he has a thing for you!  I hope either way that it works out for all of you.
25674,"Oh, have you done this before?"
25675,"Wow, good luck sounds realy hard to me."
25676,Hey that's amazing!!!  You don't see that often these days
25677,You got that right!  Good job :D   What do you all do these days?  Anything fun?
25678,Nice!!!  Nothing better than getting money in the mail!
25679,I am sure you are looking forward to it. What don't you like about it?
25680,Sorry about your bad luck. Glad you are getting out of that place!
25681,Will you be in trouble for not reinstating it?
25682,I hope it works out for you.
25683,Did anything get stolen?
25684,I'm glad they didn't run away.
25685,Oh me. too.. Whats the craziest thing you remember happening?
25686,Thats funny.  I never did anything that daring!
25687,Awesome! What are your vacation plans?
25688,"Oh man, I'm jealous. Have fun and don't forget to wear sunscreen!"
25689,me too. I have three kids too
25690,Are you serious?  There's a noise ordinance for no loud noise or music after 10:00p.m.!
25691,You might have to call the cops just to get sleep! Horrible.  Sorry.
25692,I'm so sorry you are going through this.  Maybe it would be a good thing to get a therapist so that you have someone that can help you through it.
25693,"Well, I hope you do find that special someone, and that the stress at work lets up a bit as well."
25694,Congratulations on that. That is a great life milestone for her. Is she planning on getting into a college?
25695,Sounds great. I wish all the best in her future endeavors. 
25696,Did it get worse or better?
25697,"That's horrible, you should set up an app that lets your family track you"
25698,You hvent taken anything yet?
25699,That was very generous of you.
25700,I hope so too. There's nothing worse than someone you trust not repaying you.
25701,oh yeah that really do grind!!
25702,Aww that's awesome!  Did you take a day off and go through them for the memories???
25703,Yeah I'm so happy for you!  I need to go through some of my old stuff!!
25704,Oh no! Were you upset about it ?
25705,I am sorry that happened I would be upset too! 
25706,"That is very disrespectful, especially since he is not in a stand-alone home.  Can you tell your landlord about it?"
25707,That is just crazy!  I hope he stops really soon - or you can figure out how to cut the power off on his side - LOL!
25708,That is so exciting!  What torture waiting for a whole year!  Where are you going?
25709,So fun!  Hope you have a great time!  
25710,Cake always hits the spot when you have a sweet tooth. Was it from a birthday?
25711,"Moderation is key, so you don't get sick!"
25712,Dang! That's like a 13 year old gets an extra mozz stick and ska plays in his head!
25713,I gotta go to McDonald's more often to cash in on these free nuggets!
25714,Ewwwwwwwww! Was it a runny poop or a solid poop?
25715,Yeah I would have totally done the same. That's why I don't want a dog lol!
25716,Oh I bet! Did you move far away?
25717,Wow! Why did you move so far? 
25718,I am so sorry. Did they give you another one for free?
25719,"I would feel they same way, but that was nice of them! "
25720,Why did you feel like you needed to steal candy?
25721,"Stealing very rarely is worth it, that doesn't stop people from doing it."
25722,"LOL....Best thing to do when that happens is deny, deny, deny."
25723,Smart move on your part. 
25724,Did they hit you?
25725,"I know what you mean, I would have been pissed! Probably would have gotten out and throat punched them if they had hit me!"
25726,What did she bring back?
25727,"Wow that's awful, I had lice in school."
25728,On social media?  or on the TV?
25729,"I've never really watched youtube that much, I'm not sure what I'd even watch on there.  But I know what you mean, the content can be pretty despicable."
25730,I did that too!  I remember it was a package of Big League Chew.  My mom took me back to the store and made me talk to the manager.  Did you have to do that as well?
25731,"I'm not sure what 5 is, but it's a good story to tell your kids if you have any.  I've told both of mine, and they luckily have not done the same thing."
25732,Have you found any good ones?
25733,Nice! It's always good to sit around a tell the tales of your youth to our children :)
25734,"WOW, how amazing!  I love surprise parties.  Did you get a lot of good stuff?"
25735,"That is awesome, I mean the gifts are nice, but it's even better to know that you've got people that love and care about you."
25736,"Aw, I am sorry to hear that. Is she still alive and well?"
25737,Awwwwww poor little doggie. I am sure she is chasing around mailmen happily in doggy heaven.
25738,Did you nurse her back to health and get some weight on her?
25739,I bet she was so tiny!  I'm glad you found her and were able to take care of her.
25740,"Oh no, it really sucks seeing someone you care about date someone who isn't good"
25741,"I bet if you say anything about it, you're the bad one too"
25742,That's really rough man. Is there any way you can get her back?
25743,"I am sure you'll find somebody in due time. It took me 6 years to find someone after my last relationship, but it happened. It'll happen to you too!"
25744,Those good old times of fantasy. Kid's world is so full of imagination and self-scaring created things
25745,Here is an idea. Why don't you get yourself a teddy bear by your side when sleeping. He will protect you
25746,Oh no!  How old is he/she?
25747,Yeah I understand.  Is there anywhere you can take it to get it fixed?
25748,Now why is it going to be scary? Going to a haunted house?
25749,"For what? Hallowscream at Busch Gardens?!?!? If so, that place is a blast."
25750,Oh no! That is one of my biggest fears!  What did you do?
25751,"I sure hope you get to keep your job.  I know it was a big accident, but it was an accident."
25752,"Oh no, I know that is so disappointing first hand.  The same thing has happened to me for the last three years.  Is everything going well, though?"
25753,That is a real bummer.  Maybe you can have a makeup vacation in September.
25754,I hope it went well!! she is alright now right?
25755,that's just nice of you!! helping out your sister!!
25756,Congrats! That is great news!
25757,I bet! You deserve to be proud and excited though. You have worked hard for this.
25758,That's so scary! I hope your dog is OK.
25759,I can imagine. Glad you are both alright.
25760,"Eh, you'll get there eventually. Besides, big houses aren't even that great! All you need is a moderate amount of space to live comfortably."
25761,And that's the best part. Many of those folks with nice houses have mountains of debt. It causes a lot of stress.
25762,"Well, since he's supposed to be IN the water, you may have a fatality on your hands."
25763,"Yeah, you'd better find him like quick!  Or flood your house until you do - either way.."
25764,I love animals too. What are their names?
25765,That is such a unique name I love it.
25766,Ah that's so terrible. Did you find him?
25767,i think it becomes a practice for him!!
25768,That's terrible. Did he get hurt?
25769,"Man, I am truly sorry. If I knew you, I would definitely help you out."
25770,Oh no! Do you have any other work lined up?
25771,"I hope everything works out for you, I know how hard shut downs can be. "
25772,That's so nice. I've done that a few times and really enjoyed it
25773,And you're doing something amazing!
25774,Oh that is the worst.  It really puts you on edge.  What will happen if it doesn't come on time?
25775,I really hope that it comes on time.  It can be so disappointing when something like that ruins your perfect plans.
25776,Sorry to hear that. Have you tried to explain your side of things to your boss?
25777,Hopefully this type of situation doesn't happen again. That really is disappointing how the system doesn't protect the employees about that type of situation.
25778,That is funny what did she do?
25779,That is amazing I guess she deserves to be spoon fed!
25780,i hope you have many more
25781,"Ugh, that's always the worst. I hope it wasn't something urgent you were waiting on?"
25782,"Yeah, I've had them do that to me before too. It's a pain in the keester."
25783,OMG...I know what you mean. I can't stand for anything to crawl on me or near me. Did you see any?
25784,LOL....Their waiting for you to let your guard down and then they will attack you.
25785,Oh my god! I have the heebiejeebies just thinking about it! Did it attack you?!?!
25786,I am glad to hear you are alright. But I would still be on the look out for next time...they are the relatives of godzilla after all.
25787,Wow you must be so proud!
25788,I hope he keeps it up!
25789,"I'm sorry, that's quite disgusting."
25790,That is a major issue.
25791,Nice! I am glad to hear that you got to use your Baywatch-esque skills!
25792,That's great man. You just have to wrestle a few sharks and they'll appoint you head lifeguard of the state.
25793,"I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but either way it is EPIC."
25794,"It is hard to recover from a binge like that, but do a few thousand situps and you'll be good as new!"
25795,That really sucks. Did you make it up to your co-worker?
25796,That's good to hear that you and your co-worker mad amends. Live and learn!
25797,Whoa! Did you have a strong craving or something?
25798,That's okay to give in sometimes and enjoy the moment. 
25799,"Oh, that must be stressful. Do you think he is going to be fine?"
25800,All you must have been proud of yourself
25801,That's so terrible. How could they ditch you!!
25802,"That is pretty awesome, was it something you really wanted?"
25803,"You should write a good review, sounds like they know what they are doing."
25804,That's kinda terrible. Did you apologize to him?
25805,"Well, as long as you did and the wife doesn't know, you're in the clear!"
25806,"oh no, that's teribble"
25807,he should do his work properly. He is such a naughty boy to do on the rug!!
25808,Dang! I bet that feeling felt incredible! Did you guys celebrate?
25809,"Well, that's kinda meh. But congratulations still!"
25810,That is awesome.  Is this for college?
25811,You must be feeling great.  What are you studying?
25812,"I am an officer in the United States Navy, but I agree with you. How about yourself?"
25813,"I have sailed all over the glove. Hit a couple of countries in Europe, a few scattered islands across the Atlantic. And the best part is, I've never been deployed! So I am truly living the dream that every sailor hopes for lol. I was very fortunate."
25814,Awful. I'm so sorry. Have you tried putting up posters?
25815,No doubt he will when he gets cold and hungry. 
25816,That's great! What was it?
25817,He will be rich one day!
25818,That was rude of them. Did you beat their face in?
25819,I would be too. Did you tell the manager?
25820,Ah yes!  How did it make you feel?
25821,That's awesome!  Did it brighten your day?
25822,Oooh free from what?
25823,Wow that's awesome! To the beach?
25824,Congratulations! Do you feel relieved to be done with school?
25825,What did you study?
25826,Awesome! So you'd recommend it if I were looking for a new phone?
25827,I've never been a phone of Apple anyway. I had the first iPhone and wasn't impressed so I never tried again.
25828,Great idea. Where are you planning on visiting?
25829,Why don't you take them to Six Flags. It is more fun and full of exciting experiences rushed with adrenaline
25830,"Ooh, that's exciting. What did he say? "
25831,"Wow, that's amazing, haha. So fancy. "
25832,That must have been fun to go through and remember the good old days.
25833,I love going through old memories and reliving the glory days.  Are you still friends with some of the folks you knew back then?
25834,If you keep doing them you'll look better!
25835,Maybe you should go on a diet so you don't feel sick :D
25836,"Yeah, I wish I had a nice car too."
25837,It would be nice to have money like that.
25838,That was really nice of your neighbor. I wish i had one like that
25839,Good you should be for having such a blesses neighbor
25840,"That is crazy!  Most kids first words are ""money""."
25841,"Pretty savvy place! Were you working on your 1000 page manuscript for 10 hours, squatting for free internet?"
25842,That's great! I go there almost every single day and get a bread bowl!
25843,I too feel your pain. I broke my diet by eating 4 dozen donuts in one sitting. 
25844,"We'll get back on the horse together, my friend. Skinnier days are ahead of us!"
25845,That sounds like a nice and relaxing day. What book were you enjoying?
25846,It's really cool to have those moments where you get to enjoy what you like to do.
25847,Woah how did you manage to eat 12 pizzas
25848,oh oh. It's alright next time you should be bit careful not eat a lot
25849,Oh man! A rookie mistake! Did your date notice the foul stench?
25850,"Well, I guess it didn't turn out too bad. Are you guys going for another?"
25851,woah really nice!! what and all they did
25852,you must have really enjoyed it
25853,I know! It's terrible everywhere! And I'm the only one who knows how to drive because I created the automobile!
25854,"Ugh. The horn is the worse! Especially those loud, obnoxious semi-truck horns!"
25855,Are you baking? What did you burn.
25856,"That is pretty unfortunate. You should be like me and just buy them, always easier when someone else does the work."
25857,That's really gross. Did you say anything to him about it?
25858,For sure. That really isn't something a normal person should be doing. Or anyone for that matter.
25859,"Wow, that is really impressive!"
25860,They would be very jealous!
25861,Three weeks to what?!?!?!?!?!?
25862,Awesome!  Where are you going?
25863,lol hey at least it was your neighbors sidewalk and not yours
25864,Maybe you should find out who did it and go throw toilet paper all over their yard!!
25865,"Really? What was it, that must of been pretty wild."
25866,"hmm, that is a pretty epic first world. You would think that would be a little two difficult for a first word. The kid must be a genius"
25867,I hope too !! I think you will do well!!
25868,omg!! millionaire that works at McDonalds. I would like to see you work 
25869,Dang. Do you have the whole house to yourself?
25870,That's really rough. Maybe you should go to the gym and meet some friends?
25871,That is funny. Dogs can be careless. You should take better care of it
25872,You seem to be very fed up with him. How long have you had him?
25873,It makes me feel the same. That's why I voted for myself in the last election.
25874,Truly unacceptable. We would be better off with chimpanzees in office.
25875,That man is a winner if he kept it all down!
25876,I am really amazed.  Was it you?
25877,I'm sorry that keeps happening to you.
25878,"I agree, your talents would be better suited elsewhere. "
25879,That is pretty unlucky. At lease it wasn't a power outage though.
25880,"It's like 100 degrees during the day, you would have had to find a pool to jump in."
25881,That's terrible! Is it a festering wound that will turn you into a zombie?
25882,"Nonsense! If you're a zombie, you'll be brainless and the scar will be the least of your worries!"
25883,You must be really excited of the interview and i hope you will do well
25884,You will nail it. Just be confident and just be yourself!!
25885,That is so exciting! What did he say?
25886,That is so cute! Be sure and jot that down in the baby book!
25887,"Dang, that's rough. Are you set up for next month at least?"
25888,That's great man. At least you'll have a place to stay for the next month.
25889,That's so nice of them. Where did they find it?
25890,that's a surprise and it's after 5 long years
25891,That's terrible! Did you manage to find it?
25892,That sucks man. Do you have another grandma who can give you a new one?
25893,oh no!!That's just terrible. did you made him to clean by himself!!
25894,Naughty dog. he should look after himself
25895,Really? I'm thinking about buying one myself. What kind are you getting?
25896,Nice. I have my eye on a Tesla.
25897,"Awesome, do you think you are prepared for it?"
25898,Just take deep breaths and act confidently and you'll do great!
25899,That is indeed pretty gross. Perhaps you should help her clean it up?
25900,"I don't blame you, but we have to help our struggling siblings out!"
25901,"I'm sorry to hear that, that's got to be tough on you."
25902,Mine died a couple years ago and I still think of her. :(
25903,What kind of website are you planning on designing?
25904,Nice! Perhaps I can go buy a car on the website one day!
25905,Holy cow that's amazing!  That's awesome of you!!
25906,That's the coolest thing I've heard all day
25907,That is such a great age.  Is he doing well?
25908,Hmmm. Have you asked to go over for a dip? He never said you couldn't come over and partake in the fun!
25909,I am sure! Please let him know that I am game to come over for a pool party!
25910,Ruh Roh! Did it come out of the rug easily?
25911,"Yeah, that's never a good experience.  Coming home to that smell and mess, ugh!"
25912,"Wow, that's awful. Why did he do that?"
25913,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he can get the help he needs.
25914,You should get some bug spray. Fly's are nasty
25915,"I once chased a fly around my room for 30 mins, never caught it, I think it was all in my head?"
25916,"Same, my friend! France played so well."
25917,I do hope you rubbed it into your co-workers' faces like I did!
25918,"ah, happy birthday in advance to you. And what's the plan"
25919,They definitely will get you a rum cake
25920,Used to be? What happened to it? Did it get closed down?
25921,That sounds alarming. You better be careful next time visiting the place. They maybe careless with their sanitary responsibilities
25922,That would get very irritating. Have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel?
25923,Thats too bad. I am sure it makes things very stressful and difficult.
25924,"Ah, you are going to miss him"
25925,I feel sorry for you. I just hope you guys atleast meet now and then!!
25926,Just be a good husband and you should be fine.
25927,I have no idea. What happened?
25928,Oh thank goodness you weren't late.
25929,Does it bother you when she does that?
25930,It can really be annoying when someone tells you what to do.  Have you talked to her about it?
25931,Did you just clean your place?
25932,"Mmmm, I love that brownie smell.  Also nothing better than fresh brownies."
25933,"Only you can change that, my friend!"
25934,Hey that's great!  You should take a before picture today and an after picture one month from now!
25935,That's terrible. Have you gone to a dentist to get it checked out?
25936,I would be terrified too. You have to do get it checked out!
25937,don't be !! you will do well. Just be yourself!!
25938,"That is not good, I don't think iguana's can live out in the wild."
25939,"maybe you should lay out some bait, he has to get hungry sometime."
25940,That must be great!
25941,He sounds like an excellent boss!
25942,"Oh no, that is embarrassing.  Were you able to recover by the end?"
25943,I am so sorry that happened to you.  Will you get another crack at it sometime?
25944,You must be very comfortable in your office! How did they react?
25945,"I am sorry that you now live in infamy. Maybe, with time, they can learn to forgive you."
25946,Aw yeah! What year are you in college?
25947,Just make sure you focus on getting good grades!
25948,Aw I hate to hear that. I also hope she feels better. I love my dog so much.
25949,I hope it all turns out well with good news there!
25950,That's amazing! Which word did he choose?
25951,omgoodness! I don't think I've even used flamingo in a sentence myself in a long time! He's clearly a prodigy!
25952,That's pretty neat. Did you buy anything cool?
25953,That's so cool! Sounds like a store you would find in Daiagon Alley!
25954,That must bring up scary memories.
25955,I'm sorry you didn't grow out of it.
25956,That's scary! Did you chase it away and show it who's boss?
25957,I would have done the same. Never know if the thing is going to bite off your bellybutton or not.
25958,Oh no! I hate when that happens! Does it still hurt?
25959,Sorry to hear that! Definitely need to make sure it doesn't fall off!
25960,I imagine that must have been quite a lonely experience for you. Did you see any ghosts?
25961,Nice! What kind of pizza was it?
25962,"That's awesome, I bet she loves you just as much!"
25963,"Aw, that's adorable, sounds like you guys will have a great life together!"
25964,Ewwww.  Maybe you should put them back in the oven for a bigt?
25965,haha!  Did you just eat a bunch of mushy brownies?  
25966,better hop on the elliptical for a little longer tomorrow!  Worth it!
25967,"Oh no, that's awful. Maybe you can find something else to give her for her birthday but tell her you have another present that will arrive a little later. "
25968,That's awesome! What type of work will you be doing?
25969,Hope you enjoy it!
25970,"Wow, that's quite a feat. Did he get sick?"
25971,Yeah I'd be tempted to barf myself witnessing that.
25972,Oh that's great! What job is it?
25973,She must be really smart!
25974,"That would be nerve racking, but also fun I think."
25975,Do you have a job lined up already?
25976,"Well you are ahead of the game, more so than most people."
25977,"How nice of you to loan it out! Have to admit, never heard of someone ""borrowing"" a lawn ornament though."
25978,"I'm glad you gave him a chance to shine! Everyone deserves a chance to be trusted, and it's good on you to roll the dice!"
25979,"Uh oh, what did you do?"
25980,"Ew, that does sound gross.  Was it some sort of bet or that's all you had?"
25981,Aww that's awful.  Do you have to move like for a job or something?
25982,Oh I bet.  Make sure to hang out with as many people as you can before you leave!
25983,"Nice, how much was it worth?"
25984,Make sure to give your wife a big present when it is her birthday!
25985,Oh yuck. Maybe it was expired then?
25986,I hope you threw it out!
25987,Oh what movie do you want to see?
25988,That looks really exciting!
25989,"Yes, and you didn't have to always buy items for the extra value menu."
25990,Those are the good old days. Have to use coupons these days!
25991,Oh that was so close.
25992,Maybe you will win next time!
25993,"I remember my first city apartment, the lights and sirens. It can be difficult."
25994,I don't think they know about mufflers! You should try white noise and black out curtains.
25995,Jeez. Was it audible? Smellable?
25996,"Whew, I would be too. God knows if she messed herself."
25997,I would do that to.
25998,"Yeah, they should never find out."
25999,From your house? do you have any idea who did it?
26000,"I would be furious, they are expensive now a days!"
26001,They must have been quite good.
26002,I hope you have better control next time.
26003,"Lucky! Last flat I had was on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere,lol."
26004,My cell was out of range and it was dark out. My daughter was not happy. I am glad you got help.
26005,That's very admirable of you. It feels like no one takes care of family anymore.
26006,"I am sure with your care, she will be much better off. I wish you and your family well."
26007,Oh no is your dog okay?
26008,I hope it isn't anything serious.
26009,Hey that's sweet!  What for?
26010,Ohh yeah!  That sounds awesome!  Is it a contest?
26011,I am very proud of you!  Keep it up!
26012,I wish I had your drive.
26013,Is it for your work or part of any school projects you are having?
26014,I admire engineering work. The true pioneers of society's good
26015,garbage collection most important
26016,all police not bad
26017,Would she mind that? I wouldn't really mind that so much.
26018,"We all use a certain brand here. Now, if you used my toothbrush, that would be fighting actions!"
26019,Ah that's a pity. It really sucks to lose favorite shops.
26020,It's like losing a family member... I hope you can find another shop like that someday.
26021,What movie is it?
26022,That looks like a fun movie!
26023,"What a way to wake up! That's awful, what happened?"
26024,"Well, I am sorry you had to witness that. Admittedly, it "
26025,"You uttering this phrase, i remembered the Peter Griffin Meme. So tell me, what grinds your gears?"
26026,Why you guys don't you deliver a complain note to the management. They are responsible for handling the office tools
26027,Oh no!  Why didn't you keep it in the attic or something?
26028,Oh I see.  I bet it was a sad day then.
26029,Is she a good driver?
26030,I hope she is careful with it.
26031,"Congratulations, is in an area that you are interested in?"
26032,"Awesome, I'm happy for you, good luck!"
26033,I am sorry. what happened to the cat?
26034,"I hope you have pet insurance, you never know what can happen."
26035,"Haha, I'm with you.  That's the worst, it almost ruins the meal."
26036,"You could, but it's always a gamble!"
26037,I hope you get married!
26038,ok carry on
26039,"That would make me angry, and it is impossible to deal with in a drive thru."
26040,I agree. I really hate driving off only to find out a third of your order is wrong or missing!
26041,Good thing your boss was available. I would not worry about being embarrassed. We've all done something dumb.
26042,If he does then he isn't a very good person.
26043,"I would be pretty furious as well, those can be expensive to get removed!"
26044,"I agree, some people just don't care about anyone but themselves. It's sad."
26045,I'm good. How about you?
26046,That sounds quite scary.
26047,Oh dear. Did they find out about it?
26048,Maybe one day you could repay them?
26049,That's such a great feeling! Congratulations on all the hard work you put in paying off!
26050,Then it sounds like you have two things going for you; an A+ and some new found confidence!
26051,That is awesome! Do you think you are prepared?
26052,Well that sounds like you have prepared for sure! Hope all goes well!
26053,"Yikes! that's scary, what did you do about it?"
26054,"Good play, I probably would of done the same, haha."
26055,That is so terrible!
26056,You seem like a very good friend.
26057,"That's gonna take some time. I love their designs, but I hate the assembly!"
26058,That's really cool. Have fun building the dresser!
26059,Oh no! What had happened?
26060,On the bright side you can buy a new vase to replace it!
26061,Oh what did he make you?
26062,He sounds like a fun kid!
26063,"Ah, a plunger didn't do the trick? Hope it wasn't too expensive!"
26064,"Yeah, well at least it didn't break the bank, things happen."
26065,Oh that is sad. I hope you can spend some good time together then.
26066,I hope you can also visit her there if you get the chance!
26067,That's awesome. I saved up for 4 months but then had a massive car repair bill..
26068,I know. My advice is take it seriously just in case
26069,That's so frustrating! Do you know who it is?
26070,Sorry to hear that. Maybe you and the other tenets can lobby for additional parking somehow?
26071,"Wow, that must have made you feel so good about yourself."
26072,It's such a great joy to win something. I hope your luck continues.
26073,That could be kind of scary. Have you tried to meet anyone that might could show you around and then maybe you would not be so lonely?
26074,"Well, maybe try meeting some new friends? Someone a little closer, perhaps?"
26075,Good for you! It is really dangerous to do that.
26076,Hopefully you can teach your friend to copy your behavior!
26077,Was it The Meg?
26078,I can't wait to see it now!
26079,That is so messed up.
26080,The world is not fair.
26081,Nice. I love donuts. Are you going to go there as soon as they open?
26082,"I haven't had any in a while, but now I suddenly want some!"
26083,Yes I agree. I love to watch them do their routines on TV.
26084,Something about watching the world's best really keeps me interested.
26085,Wow! How big was it? Did you smell it?
26086,"Yeah, gotta be careful and give them their space"
26087,Yikes! That made a mess I bet. Did you get burned?
26088,"Yeah, and it can stain. I drop my coffee more often than I am willing to admit."
26089,Oh my god! That sounds terrifying
26090,Just don't get too close! You never know what can trigger them
26091,"Me too, I'm excited for fall, I like to layer my clothes"
26092,And the snow! I'm excited to start skiing again
26093,I would love to try them.
26094,I really love snickerdoodles!
26095,Don't be so hard on yourself. Some people are just naturals!
26096,"Singing is like any other skill. With time and practice, I bet you can really tune those pipes!"
26097,You should put some time aside to study.
26098,"That's a good start, just stay motivated and focus on learning everything you can. You should pass the test easily."
26099,By who? Who are you trying to get noticed by?
26100,Oh that's so nice! I'm sure you're a great coworker and employee
26101,That's nice to hear! Have you treated her to something special?
26102,"Always stay faithful, it is the best thing for your relationship."
26103,That must have been very humiliating.
26104,"oooh, sorry, that must have been embarrassing"
26105,"take it easy, did you find your way out?"
26106,Oh no! Was it a small local place?
26107,"That's too bad, small places are usually hidden gems for food"
26108,Ouch. I actually have done that before too though... 
26109,"It's embarrassing in the moment, but I think there are more clumsy people all around us. "
26110,jeez that sucks
26111,what time is the trip
26112,"Oh, that is just awful. Losing someone is so hard. "
26113,"Was he ill or was it sudden? Either way, it's still painful. "
26114,That sounds scary. What made you feel unsafe?
26115,I would have probably felt the same way as you. How did everything turn out?
26116,Awesome! Have you been looking forward to it?
26117,Great! I hope you have fun and remember it for a long time
26118,I'm sorry.  I hope you find it.
26119,Where do you think it can be?
26120,Oh no that sounds frustrating! I get road rage!
26121,Yes! Whats even worse is when other people don't pay attention in bad traffic!
26122,"Wow, that is impressive!"
26123,I wish your friend could teach my dog a few tricks!
26124,It's good to hear! Are you alright now?
26125,Fine. Have a joyful life ahead!
26126,"A hike in your package? I'm sorry, I don't follow. As in how long it would take to get there to you?"
26127,"Ohh.. I see! I'm sorry to hear that. I've never had the personal experience of having to do so, but sometimes people really have to argue and advocate for themselves to get the things they feel they've earned and deserved, like a salary raise. I hope in the future you can do that so that you can feel like you're getting what you've earned."
26128,That sounds like it would be pretty gross.
26129,"Definitely, I'm not a super clean person but that's a bit far."
26130,I hope you get a fresh start elsewhere!
26131,"Oh I understand, mine is only 2 1/2 right now but I feel that way too when going through his preemie clothes. You probably feel it much more if they are grown though."
26132,Yes! Do you keep your favorite things of theirs? I always keep my favorite outfits of his and donate the rest!
26133,What a beautiful memory tho to have! Yeah a little weird but a little cool too! 
26134,ha ha i understand its creepy but then again my mother kept her mothers glass eyeball so i guess nothing would surprise me anymore! 
26135,Oh no! What kind of exam was it?
26136,I bet! What are you going to school for?
26137,"Oh, don't worry. You'll get good response. What was the email about?"
26138,Hope! you'll get a good reply!
26139,In his work? or life?
26140,Give him some time. I'm in counseling and it's taken about a month for it to really help.
26141,Thats good to hear. Being independent  all your life and then being cared for all the time can be a hard transition
26142,Hopefully this will work out well for everyone involved.
26143,Oh I hate when that happens. Did you make it on time?
26144,That sucks. Why did you wake up late?
26145,That sounds so fun. What great friends!
26146,I am sure it was a great time!
26147,"Losing weight is the best feeling. I did that a couple of summers ago.. It's one of those few things where you can visibly see yourself getting better, and there's not much that gives you as much pride as that. Congratulations!"
26148,"I was proud of my mom when she started focusing more on her weight, too, just because of what you said--she's getting older. I wish she could live to 150, so anything that helps her live longer, makes me really happy. Good for you for making that choice sooner rather than later."
26149,"There is always social security and part time jobs, that seems to be the norm these days. A lot of old people do not have enough saved"
26150,I understand and i seriously think finance should be taught in school at a young age but the banks do not want that and will fight to keep that class out of schools
26151,What place did you go to?
26152,"That makes sense, but yeah, human error is a very real thing, which is why self driving cars would probably be an improvement"
26153,"Glad to hear your life took a turn. It's always weird, and even sometimes funny, to look back on your life to see where you came from, and how different and sometimes worse things were"
26154,"Well, it's always so annoying in the beginning, when you know you have to change, but to see how much work there is to do in order to reach that change. It's hard for people to break things up into smaller pieces so it's not so daunting. But congratulations to you for reaching a happier place"
26155,Wow! How often do you play the lottery?
26156,Neat! Well that is a fantastic feat. Maybe you can win again sometime?
26157,That is awesome. How was the rest of the show?
26158,Whoa that sounds incredible. You are very lucky to have witnessed that.
26159,Did they go away or did you break up?
26160,"Well, remember that he is doing something healthy for himself and that should make your relationship stronger in the end."
26161,"Good mom, or dad?"
26162,I hear you :) My mom is like that. It means you're a great nurturer.
26163,Oh man! Was it poisonous?
26164,"Hmm, what state do you live in? Although I am in Michigan and we have poisonous ones here too. I didn't even realize in MID michigan we did until I almost stepped on one..I had a panic attack too lol"
26165,Oh man..TN has water mocassins I think- Be careful!
26166,Ah I'm sorry to hear that. Were you really busy today then?
26167,"Oh yeah I know it. I have to work remote sometimes and, depending on the mood, loneliness hits hard."
26168,"Those sound super effective. I wish I had some of them here,  I have never seen mosquitoes as bad as they are this year."
26169,"I will have to look into those, they sound like a really good investment."
26170,"Oh, that's disgusting! Have you tried to talk to them about it?"
26171,Oh my god! I would contact your city or DHEC. I bet if they started to get fined they would clean it up!
26172,"Ive wanted to play the switch for so long long, I have heard such good things about it.  do you like it?"
26173,"I think that is my problem with games, I dont have the time"
26174,What did you fail at exactly?
26175,"I am sorry to hear that, I hope you are able to succeed eventually!"
26176,"Oh, I see. Were they making fun of you guys?"
26177,thats gross.
26178,yea i wouldnt touch that no matter how much they wanted to pay me heh
26179,Do you normally have to work on weekends? What did you do? 
26180,Sounds like fun glad you got to do enjoy yourself 
26181,"Gaah! That's a state tax bill? That's insane, it's hard enough already to open a business."
26182,"Jesus! I hate opening my mail already because it's bills, I can't imagine trying to do something that ambitious which in of itself is a lot of work to get a business started and you have to learn so many different things, and then on top of it being sent stuff like that. Agghh! I hope it ends well for you, though."
26183,I can't imagine! I have a hard time sitting for long hours too. What are you looking in too?
26184,Thats a job that is needed for sure. You could also try and get a degree in programming- it usually only takes a year? So many things you can do. Also look into selling online. It's a great business if you stay on top of it daily :)
26185,Never heard of such a thing. Is it outdoors?
26186,"True, is it a fun place too go?"
26187,Did they pick it back up?
26188,Maybe they just don't notice it.
26189,"oh that is cool, did it bring back some memories as well?"
26190,That sucks. Are there any cameras in the parking lot?
26191,Some people have no integrity....
26192,"Oh? Did someone leave it open, or did someone break in?"
26193,Oh no! I hope you find him
26194,how many fingers have they lost?
26195,now that is impressive
26196,call the po-po.
26197,spray the hose in that direction to get the tv wet.
26198,I would have been terrified! What did you do?
26199,Oh poor thing!  What did you do?
26200,"Yay!  I had a little box turtle when I was younger, I liked her a lot.  I hope Mrs. Lee has a long and happy (and not thirsty :)) life with you!"
26201,What all do you have to get done?
26202,"Phew, that sounds like a lot of work! You better start getting on that, then!"
26203,It is scary yet exhilarating lol
26204,Some don't like them. I can't do the ones that go straight down.
26205,"Oh wow, congratulations! I'm guessing you weren't expecting?"
26206,I'm so glad! When are you due?
26207,Oh yeah why is that? Did the cops drag you out? 
26208,hahah stripped sounded so much better but okay tripped! I gotcha 
26209,Thats a big accomplishment. 
26210,Next thing you know she will be walking. 
26211,Weekends off are always great.  What did you do with your time?
26212,Sounds fun.  I hope you had a good time!
26213,"That's a lot of dedication. Was it for a special occasion? And have you been baking for very long, or do you do it professionally at all?"
26214,"Oh, I feel terrible for both of you. Your hard work lost, and she probably feels really guilty too, for something that was maybe an accident. I hope you guys were able to talk it out and not get too upset with one another after a while."
26215,As long as otherdays you are eating healthy I think its fine to cheat once in awhile
26216,Just hit the gym as soon as you can and you will feel better!
26217,"Who hasn't that happened to before! If it took you that long to notice, I bet no one else noticed. Were you able to fix it later?"
26218,"Yeah, I can understand how you would feel embarrassed there. It sounds like it didn't lead to anything too bad though, so maybe most people don't remember it happened at this point."
26219,I love the feeling a rollercoaster gives. Have you gone before?
26220,Yes the juice is certainly worth the squeeze
26221,Good for you! what are you planning to spend it on?
26222,Enjoy it! You deserved it :) I hope you will get more checks like that 
26223,that's wonderful! I go to church every sabbath
26224,i agree with you! I don't know what i would do without God. 
26225,I am sure he has heard it before!
26226,"You were just in the moment, I bet it wont happen again"
26227,"A three pound burger?!? That's crazy, I could never eat one of those in one sitting."
26228,"Wow. I bet that's going to hurt him later, though."
26229,Did you travel for work or for vacation?
26230,Its too soon to be homesick!
26231,That is awesome. You sound confident.
26232,Good for you. Good luck. Just remember to have a good time and you will be fine. 
26233,That's too bad. Do you mow a lot?
26234,Absolutely. There are things far more important than lawn length.
26235,And how does that make you feel?
26236,What is she going to school for?
26237,well what are some things that are bad from him
26238,ohh i mean maybe you can go and give it a try and see how he does
26239,Your company left you alone? In what way? That does sound like a troubling situation.
26240,"Oh, I see. That makes a little more sense. Did everything work out, or are they still gone?"
26241,What is your character?
26242,"Cool, well have a good time theifing!"
26243,I just love Fall! I'm guessing that's your favorite season?
26244,I feel you. Watching the leaves change colors makes me feel peaceful.
26245,"awh that does sweet of you, what kind of pet is it? "
26246,ive always wanted one of those but to be honest i would be afraid lol 
26247,where were they
26248,oh that was nice
26249,I know how you feel I can be lonely sometimes. 
26250,I recommend taking some time to explore the city and find an hobby or interest and join some groups. It takes time to find a new set of friends.
26251,Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! 
26252,Hopefully something similar will come up soon. Maybe you can check for another position in the company you're hoping for!
26253,did you get it dismissed?
26254,thats the law!
26255,Maybe he was upset with you.
26256,Then you'd get in lots of trouble as most places have laws that your dog can't be on the loose
26257,Whoa what a great surprise. Congratulations.
26258,I am sure you deserve it. That is fantastic.
26259,Long trip. How can you afford it?
26260,"Okay, I get it. Ever seen the movie ""Hostel""?"
26261,Is it physical? If you need anything let me know.
26262,Does it work for good luck?
26263,I understand. Is it a very nice watch?
26264,did you make it ?
26265,sounds like the start of a business
26266,"That's wonderful. Always nice to take some time for the self, especially with PTO."
26267,Make sure to enjoy it to the fullest.
26268,Yikes. Did you ever find the spider?
26269,I think its time to invest in a can of bug spray
26270,If you kno
26271,Leaving family at home?
26272,Behave on your vacation :)
26273,That's so awesome! What a huge relief that must be. 
26274,Keep focused! You can do it! Being debt free is an amazing feeling!
26275,good memories ?
26276,thats always good 
26277,Did you have some special plans for the weekend that you couldnt go do? 
26278,Well hopefully you can go soon 
26279,that sounds interesting
26280,What is going on next week?
26281,That is awesome. Kids here start tomorrow so I know the feeling of being ready for them to go!
26282,I wouldn't want to do that.
26283,It's just not worth it.
26284,i agree with you there.
26285,How nice of him!! you should be thankful to him!!
26286,now how nice of you!! thats what  are friends for. I Hope you will get a job and your friend will get a gift!!
26287,Very nice. I am sure you deserve it.
26288,Good for you. Buy yourself something special.
26289,I am sure it is a bittersweet moment.  I can relate myself.  It takes some getting used to
26290,You will still have plenty of time before your son becomes an unruly teenager.  Cherish it.
26291,Oh yeah that's couldn't have been good!
26292,Most definitely! would you say you live in a good neighborhood?
26293,Hey it's a win win! You get the nice points and she gets her lunch! 
26294,"I bet she loves you for it either way! It doesn't matter how little the effort was, it matters if it was nice! "
26295,I'll bet it was! That must have been an enormous burger!
26296,Haha! I'd need a lot more than a free tshirt to eat a 3 pound burger!
26297,did you beat her down ?
26298,im sure it will make you feel better.
26299, I was late to an appointment recently because I got stuck in a traffic jam. 
26300,That's so annoying. Maybe you should leave earlier next time
26301,What kind of prank did he pull on you?
26302,"Well, what kind of prank was it?"
26303,how soon after did the beatdown come ?
26304,thats what im talking about!
26305,Did you talk to your boss?
26306,"That's awful, what did you want to do?"
26307,That's such a shame. Could you perhaps join them for a couple of days?
26308,Yeah. Oh to be a kid again and not have to deal with all that! So sorry you're going to miss time with your family. Hopefully they'll take lots of photos!
26309,what ended up happening?
26310,oh well good luck
26311,"Oh no, did they leave a note?"
26312,"What a jerk, I'm sorry that happened."
26313,That sounds pretty awesome. How long until you get off from work?
26314,hahaha hope you have fun!
26315,Did someone give you a recipe or did you google it? Keep tasting it until you get what you want! 
26316,"As long as it has good reviews, make sure you put a little squeeze of lime in it at the end. It really brings out the flavor. right before you serve it tho. "
26317,I love ramen! not the healthiest food in the world but tastes good and hits the spot
26318,"my mom doesn't lol but she is crazy about healthy vegetarian food ,so :)"
26319,"Exciting, is it hazardous scary or more excited scary?"
26320,"Well, go in with an open mind and maybe your experience will be different. And be sure you pay attention to the safety requirement!"
26321,"Chemicals mean serious business, but you landed the job. Good luck with doing well."
26322,Ahhh i bet your nerves are thru the roof. Whens the test date? 
26323,"I wish you a lot of luck, and try not to let it get the best of you ( way easy to say... way hard to actually do. i know ) "
26324,Have you asked the merchant why it is late?
26325,I would be too! They should be more diligent with their shipping estimates!
26326,What field are you in?
26327,"That is awesome, I hope it goes well"
26328,Did you ever get cheated on?
26329,Well that is good for you then!
26330,Is Fall your favorite season?
26331,Summer is my favorite because it means vacation!
26332,Did you stop to help him?
26333,We've all been there...at least I have.
26334,"Oh wow, is he flirting with her? Does he know she is a relationship with you?"
26335,"I would defenitly just have her block the number, so he gets the message. "
26336,Nice! What will you be doing?
26337,"Nothing to be nervous about, I'm sure you'll do fine!"
26338,"i know i am really exited, what do you have planned?"
26339,that is what i love the most about Thanksgiving the food is always the best
26340,"That is so awesome, have you been accepted yet/"
26341,I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!
26342,Any damage to where you live ?
26343,I hope you can get it all cleaned up without too much trouble.
26344,"Probably once or twice in my life, but I dont go anywhere alone so... :/ "
26345,"That is really crappy, i think whatever makes you feel that way you should try to figure it out and battle it! You deserve to be happy all the time. "
26346,That would be annoying.
26347,"That would be bothersome, especially if it's taking away from your time."
26348,That is always fun to do.  What did you get yourself?
26349,That is very cool.   I like tech that is practical but also fun to use.  
26350,Do you know what their names will be?
26351,Have you had any kids yet?
26352,Oh that's wonderful twins seem really cool.
26353,"Congrats, I've heard that many twins have a special bond so I hope they have that and do well."
26354,"Yikes, were you able to clean it up?"
26355,That sounds like it would do the trick. Hopefully his couch is okay.
26356,What did you guys eat?
26357,"lol, did you tell your friend about the hair?"
26358,What contest is that?
26359,I hope you win!
26360,Congratulations! That's a very good job. What kind of food do you prepare?
26361,"Well they must think a lot of your abilities to promote you like that. I love Mexican food, btw :)"
26362,I love it when managers actually pay attention. Makes the job so much easier and more pleasant. Good for you.
26363,"No, it wasn't you, obviously. Your previous manager sounds like a control freak!"
26364,How long has it been since you have gotten a raise?
26365,Did you talk to your manager?
26366,Not worth the risk is it ?
26367,"Okay, you know you can buy them too. And somebody lost for your gain."
26368,Oh no! Is he/she okay? 
26369,Blood makes me freak out too. That is pretty scary! I'm glad they are okay.
26370,Seriously?  What was going on?
26371,Oh that's awful. I am glad you and your stuff is okay though!
26372,That is such an exciting time and really nice of everyone to do that.
26373,That also helps relieve some stress off of you trying to get everything ready by yourselves.
26374,"That sounds nice, how long has it been"
26375,It will feel like old times for sure
26376,"Wow, great! you must be so proud!"
26377,"Of course,  that is fantastic!  Congratu;e him from me."
26378,Congratulations! You must be very proud of her. What kind of recital was it?
26379,I bet! It takes quite a level of talent and composure to perform publicly like that. Kudos to your daughter!
26380,Could you call people?
26381,Yes meet new people!
26382,that is lucky do you talk much in class?
26383,well you probably should start paying much attetion if you dont want to risk it
26384,Its good that you like it so much. Why are you worried that it will close?
26385,"Oh, I understand. Maybe they make up for it on busy days, like weekends.I hope they stay open so you can continue to enjoy their food."
26386,"Oh no, did anyone see"
26387,"Thats unfortunate, I am sure they will forget"
26388,I'm so sorry to hear that. Were you able to be there when she passed?
26389,Sometimes you don't know when they'll pass unfortunately. I hope you take some time to grive.
26390,How was the service?
26391,Did you put any money in the collection pot?
26392,Did you dig it out of the trash?
26393,Did you cry yourself to sleep that night?
26394,That's a great surprise!
26395,That's really nice. I hope it was a big raise!
26396,Im sorry to hear that? Is it a bad cold?
26397,That's good to hear. But kids can be a handful when they are sick.
26398,I bet that's super awesome! Is it really comfortable? 
26399,"Oh man, I would fall asleep in that"
26400,That is never a good feeling
26401,Do you have some bills that you can put off until later?
26402,Will you go again?
26403,I can understand that for sure.
26404,Sounds like a fun thing to do. What kind of racing did you see?
26405,"Oh, I've never seen that. It sounds amazing! If they're anything like the F1 drivers they'll be incredible!"
26406,Yes! I love Halloween. I need to start making plans myself.
26407,"That's awesome, I hope he enjoys it too!"
26408,That was really nice of them! I'm glad you got some help
26409,Amazing! That had to be really stressful too though
26410,"that is not good, do you have any idea why you spaced out"
26411,dont worry about it it happens to everyone it is nothing to be ashamed of
26412,Are you one of the Uber drivers?
26413,Did they apologize to you?
26414,"That's a special moment. To hopefully see your kids doing better than you and all that jazz. I'm in college but my parents live only a couple hours away, so I just visit them instead, since them coming to me wouldnt be anything too special. But congratulations to you and your kid"
26415,"That's awesome that he is helping to break the mold then. Says just as much about him as it does about you, though. Takes good parenting to get him to that level of motivation"
26416,It's great to hear that you're in such good shape! I need to work on that myself.
26417,"Yeah, I wasn't careful about what I ate when I was younger, and I'm really paying for it now. Hopefully they can get back in shape too."
26418,That is a nice way to remember him. Its good that you have something of his to keep his memory alive.
26419,I'm sure that's an awesome feeling. 
26420,"Yeah, don't be too hard on yourself for that. We're supposed to like that stuff."
26421,I see. You'll find balance along the way though.
26422,"I used to be that way, because I love holidays and the mood it puts everyone in. But I'm starting to hate how short the fall and winter days are, and how quickly it gets dark. Now that I've been exercising outside more lately, I hate losing that time in the sun"
26423,"I can understand that. And I live in the south, so it doesn't get that cold, so I can't really complain. I visited my girlfriend who lives in the midwest last winter, and it got under 0 at times. I could not live like that long term."
26424,That must have been painful and a little embarrassing!
26425,"Probably they just fell bad for you, thank god it was not worse."
26426,"Yikes. I live in the south and we don't get those. Just palmetto bugs (flying roaches). I think I'd rather have those than rats, personally."
26427,"My girlfriend has complained about rats too, since she lives in the midwest. Says she'll be taking out the trash and she'll hear them scurrying and it will freak her out. Good luck to you guys who have to deal with the little disease-infested things.."
26428,I'm so proud of you! That's a lot to deal with all at once! 
26429,It's worth it! It'll teach you a lot that you'll use later in life 
26430,That's very sad. My Grandma had that and it is devastating to experience it. I'm told that doing puzzles etc. keeps the brain active and maybe at least delays it.
26431,"I really feel for you. It's not easy, I won't kid you. But at least you understand what's happening and are obviously prepared for the inevitable."
26432,"I hear you there, it can be more relaxing spending time at home thang going to a hectic party. "
26433,Will your friend be disappointed with you?
26434,I would be so excited! I'm so proud of you! 
26435,Hopefully you have some wine to celebrate with! 
26436,that's annoying. maybe you should try giving them a call again?
26437,"i completely understand, i hope they will call you soon so you won't have to"
26438,Oh. Do you have to buy a lot of presents or do you just not know what to buy?
26439,I understand. You know there are websites were you can answer a few questions about the person you are buy a gift for and then it makes gift recommendations for that person.
26440,"Yeah, I have tried it a few times. It suggests some pretty cool things too."
26441,"Oh wow! That usually doesn't happy, usually that feeling fades with time. "
26442,It sounds like you have a keep of a place to go!
26443,Wow that's awesome. You must be feeling pretty content.
26444,You did things right. You will be able to retire one day on your current track.
26445,"That's pretty cool to hear. When I have kids, I hope they're the same, and can get into sports, since it offers so much. Good for you for getting them into sports"
26446,"It'd be cool if she made it to the stage where she could play the World Cup.. I feel like that's such a cool sporting event, and if you had your child in that, that'd create some kind of family legacy."
26447,Did you bring it in and take care of it?
26448,That's very kind of you. Too often people neglect stray animals and they suffer terrible short lives.
26449,Did the neighbors come after you?
26450,Maybe or at least recovered your basketball!
26451,Tell him you had to go to the store!
26452,How nice! Are you going out or are you going to have a nice night in?
26453,Thats great. I hope you both enjoy yourselves.
26454,Congratulations! I am sure you are very happy and beeming with pride right now. Whats the next step for her?
26455,Excellent! Any scholarships in the future?
26456,How scary!  I hope your neighbors are ok.
26457,"That is great, at least there was something positive!"
26458,"Awesome, what kind of restaurant is it?"
26459,"I love thai food, I can see why it made you feel good!"
26460,Oh wow a wonderful surprise indeed!
26461,Yes it's always good to have family!
26462,That's really cool. Did it bring back good memories?
26463,I'm very sorry for your loss. I'm glad you have the letter from him though.
26464,I guarantee you know more than you think! Just be methodical and you'll do just fine.
26465,"Everyone needs a math genius friend, lol. At least, you do if you're as hopeless at math as I am!"
26466,oh im so sorry you felt this way! I hope your mood will get better. maybe watch a good comedy?
26467,i understand how you feel though. i would feel lonely but i would definitely do something fun like play video games or watch movie
26468,"That's terrible.. There's nothing more frustrating and deflating in life than unexpected expenses. I hope you're able to cover all of it. I know if I had one right now, I might not be able to manage it."
26469,"I hope you can. If you think there's even a chance, then give it a shot, if it will save you that much money. My brother watches Youtube videos all the time of how to fix random things, and it seems to work for him. If you're the type of person that can learn that way, and if you have the patience, then I think it's a good thing to try."
26470,What was she so negative?
26471,What kind of dog is it?
26472,"Oh that's terrible, getting delayed always annoys me"
26473,Oh yes that sounds a little dangerous I wouldn't take that flight unless it was necessary. 
26474,"That sounds so nice! I love to be with my dog outside too, even if just watching him play."
26475,Yes!v and a good exercise too!
26476,"that's great, what did you have for lunch? i had some hot dogs and baked beans"
26477,"i love chicken alfredo! so delicious. I wish i could nap too lol i'm a mom, moms don't nap"
26478,How did you like it? Did it give an energy boost?
26479,"Wow, so it definitely made a difference. I bet you will be drinking more then."
26480,You know there is one thing that might make it even better.
26481,"Yea, but have you ever experienced wings before?"
26482,I wish i could go to my old high school. i moved far from it but if i come back i will visit
26483,i bet! High school was fun. We couldn't wait to become adults lol
26484,"Ewww. I hate it when dog owners don't pick up after their pets. We always carried a poop bag with us for when our pooch ""went""."
26485,"No, they're not, and it's not just in this country. Europe is terrible for dog poo in the streets!"
26486,Thats amazing! he must really really love you.
26487,Well atleast he did what he could to show you he cares.
26488,That's pretty gross. Were there other people around? I'm always more nervous about that when people are around.
26489,That sounds horrifying. Pretty sure I would die.
26490,Haha oh no. Sometimes you need a cheat day.
26491,Maybe next time have a huge meal before you start baking. That way you arent hungry. 
26492,It's good to be confident. I am sure you will get some good news soon.
26493,You did great. Just wait and don't stress about it.
26494,Wow! Was your order important? Have you called the post office to find out what happened?
26495,Well that's good. I hope her makes it before the end of the day and you get your package.
26496,Awe! Hopefully they were cute pictures
26497,Growing up sucks! Lmao
26498,"Congratulations! It's not easy moving to a new place, but it's great fun getting to know your new home!"
26499,That takes a lot of courage. I'm proud of you! I moved last year and it's both fun and scary at the same time
26500,Did you wind up eating it?
26501,"lol, you are such a nice person. I would have definately kicked that guy out!"
26502,Happy early birthday! Do you have any plans?
26503,That's a great plan. I hope your wife makes it happen!
26504,"That is terrifying, did you get away from it?"
26505,"That is good, who knows if the dog has rabies or not. It would be unpleasant to get bit! "
26506,Have you been expecting it long? 
26507,Oh no!! I hope it comes soon. I know how that it to be waiting for money to come. 
26508,You dont like to gossip at all?
26509,"I understadn that, Others business is a very sensitive subject"
26510,Is this brother of your's a lot younger than you are?
26511,"Would you say your relationship is like the one in that movie, Brother Bear?"
26512,"What What, tell me?"
26513,what were some of your favorites?
26514,You must miss her. But I'm sure she'll be back before you know it!
26515,She must like to travel. Have you ever gone with her?
26516,Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch. 
26517,I know what you mean. It seems they keep the crap shows going for years and the good ones get cancelled. 
26518,Did you flip the bird? Some people are so rude.
26519,You should also post the license plate on social media. Sometimes public shaming does wonders.
26520,Well it's a teacher's goal to make sure his or her students succeed.  She wants you to do your best.
26521,It's always good when you have a teacher who cares and puts forth the effort to help you as much as possible.
26522,Must feel good to get it over with. How do you think you did?
26523,That is great. You must have been very confident up there.
26524,"Yes! I bet it will, did you go in and kill it?"
26525,"What is the job, will you like it?"
26526,"Thats amazing, I have actually had that happen to be before in my life, I was so happy"
26527,"Thats right, taht makes me so happy to know"
26528,What did you fail?
26529,How many times have you tried?
26530,I almost feel like homework is counter productive. Shouldn't the schools be teaching the kids enough during their 8 hours?
26531,"I guess you're right. Education isn't something that can be rushed! But still, I think homework is a little excessive."
26532,I'm sure there'll be other games it will be useful for.
26533,I built my own too a few years ago.
26534,"At times, though I don't have as much time anymore."
26535,"That's a shame, do you have anything else lined up?"
26536,There'll probably be something else
26537,Is that a bad thing?
26538,That's good
26539,Oh that cinnabon smell can be so enticing!
26540,That sounds so good. I haven't had one in forever.
26541,Oh man! I would be so excited! When do you go?
26542,Man that's going to be so awesome! 
26543,Talk crap get smacked
26544,Is this a true story
26545,"mcdonalds is honestly gross to me though, rich or poor. i dont eat it."
26546,"Thatnks, just a matter of preference I guess."
26547,"oh my god, thats it so gross, cat pee is the worst."
26548,"im so sorry,  thats why im not the biggest fan of animals."
26549,That sounds like quite a ride. Are you a fan of rollercoasters in general?
26550,I understand that. I hate rollercoasters too.
26551,That is great to hear. Anything new going on?
26552,I wish I were so content. Must be a nice feeling.
26553,Did it do much damage to your car ?
26554,"Well, I hope they had insurance at least."
26555,"Dang, that really blows. What was it made of, glass?"
26556,They should use metal. That never breaks. Sorry that happened to you.
26557,Did you get up to go check to see what it was?
26558,Thats absoulty terrifying to be honest.
26559,How long did it take? 
26560,Doesn't sound too bad
26561,That's awesome. What band is it?
26562,Never heard of it. I hope it was a good show!
26563,It's hard for kids to do that. Maybe he was just bored?
26564,"Oh no, I bet she ends up loving it!  Best of luck!"
26565,Oh nice!  What kind of phone did you get?
26566,Think of all the mindless browsing you can do now!
26567,"Oh, now that's exciting! Do you have any plans to do it? Celebrating with anyone?"
26568,"That's wonderful! I'm happy for you. Hopefully he got you something meaningful, sentimental, and long-lasting so that you can keep on enjoying it!"
26569,"Honestly that will end up being a lot better in the long run anyway, won't it? More memorable to know he really spent time and effort getting something for you."
26570,"oh man, sorry to hear that. i mean good for your friend but i feel you. i never win anything"
26571,maybe one day we will win really big! who knows
26572,a backed old man?
26573,"Hahaha yeah, that kinda sucks"
26574,That's really cool. What is your idea?
26575,That sounds like a really cool idea. I hope that it turns out well!
26576,"That is really kind of you, many people would not bother. I hope that she wins her battle."
26577,"Chemotherapy and radiation can really take their toll. There is a program through the cancer society that does a day of beauty with cancer patients. They give them a makeover, giftbags, wigs if needed."
26578,"That is excellent, and you are a truly giving person. I wish her the best."
26579,Why's that? 
26580,I'd imagine it feels pretty nostalgic
26581,Oh no! If it helps they probably don't remember. That stuff filters out faster than you would think!
26582,"Well, I feel for ya! I'm a very clumsy person myself, trip all the time."
26583,Im sure they understand. That is a tough position to be in.
26584,Maybe try and reach out on social media to a few of them. Im sure they would love to hear from you.
26585,Did he hurt the baby? Most of the time they are just curious 
26586,"Yeah, that's what they do. Hahaha"
26587,"Aww, did you take it home with you? It's great to adopt strays."
26588,Then I am sure the cat is yours. Enjoy your ball of fur!
26589,I totally understand that feeling. It's very frustrating. All you can do is try your best and try not to pay too much attention to that aspect.
26590,I think we all have our good days and bad days. Just keeping plugging along and I bet it gets better soon. It recently did for me.
26591,I know how you feel. Keep your head up. Start putting out more applicaitons.
26592,Oh that is the best. Did you buy anything?
26593,Perfect. Must have been a nice surprise.
26594,Do it! She may say yes!
26595,Good! The sooner the better!'
26596,"Wow, thats really lucky of you.  Its good to find nice people out there"
26597,Good thing you found that guy and not someone else
26598,Cool! There isn't anything like that around where I live
26599,About what?
26600,How did it go? S[eeches can be intimidating
26601,Weel thats good
26602,That's great you have such great friends!
26603,Well he checks all of the boxes doesn't he!
26604,Oh man that's a bummer.  Did you leave her or are you giving her another shot
26605,Dang that's harsh homie...so sorry to hear that bud.  Don't worry as much as it hurts now she did you the favor of kicking herself out of your life...you deserve better than her 
26606,A RAT! I would have died
26607,You should get traps. You may have scared it away. I think only mice get scared though. Rats are like dinosaur mice
26608,That is nice of you. I hope he appreciated it.
26609,Well I am sure he will appreciate the effort even if it doesn't come out great. You are being thoughtful.
26610,That's sad. What happened?
26611,That's so bad. I don't have any pets
26612,Oh I love vacations! Do you love the water?
26613,It's beautiful I'm sure you'll have tons of fun.
26614,You must be very proud. That is awesome.
26615,Hopefully he keeps up. Im sure he has a great attitude.
26616,That's wonderful!
26617,That shows how lucky you can be!
26618,Oh no! I hope that you were able to get someone to fix it!
26619,Probably a good idea!
26620,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. My cat is getting old, she's 15. I'm scared she'll pass soon too"
26621,That's so sad. I hope you feel better soon. I would be so devastated too.
26622,Sometimes it can be difficult to get your footing when starting out. It sounds like you enjoy your life now and have something to be proud of.
26623,"That is all that people can expect of you, that you try to be the best you possible, each and every day."
26624,That's... exciting..
26625,"That really sucks, I've had that happen to me as well."
26626,"I agree, most don't bother with something so simple like throwing away trash or returning grocery carts or holding open doors."
26627,That really stinks. Maybe you should try and find something that your good at and do that!
26628,What do you think you are really good?
26629,Cool! Did you go to Greece for vacation?
26630,"Sounds awesome, I've never been to Europe"
26631,That's awesome. I hope that it goes well!
26632,Do you feel confident in you did on your finals?
26633,I am so happy for you. Doe she make you feel special?
26634,That is awesome. Everyone wishes to find someone like that.
26635,What did he do to inspire such pride
26636,Nice. That is pretty awesome
26637,"Wow thats really impressive.  Well I need to be open.  Flow to me money, flow to me..."
26638,$1 Billion come to me.  Im ready to recieve you
26639,"Oh that sounds great, I hope you get it!"
26640,So exciting! Are you happy to move to a new job?
26641,Maybe she will let you borrow it. Or maybe if she gets a new one she will give it to you.
26642,"That's way too expensive for a bag. What is it made of, gold? Haha."
26643,You got an awesome girlfriend. Who are you going to see?
26644,She sure surprised you. I hope you have a great time at the concert.
26645,Whoa that is out there. Takes some real confidence to rock that.
26646,Yea that is true. I hate that.
26647,I know the feeling too. I'm a 1000 miles from my family. 
26648,Yeah same to you. I'm counting down the days until I get to see them again. 
26649,In 57 days according to my coutdown!
26650,oh my goodness. that is crazy. i've never had anything like that happen.
26651,that's amazing. what are you going to do with your amazing gift?
26652,Oh yeah?  How did that go? 
26653,"Yep that happens lots of times but, I don't think we're supposed to talk about the elephant in the room per the instructions.."
26654,That sucks.  Did they give a reason?
26655,Well maybe you can complain and get some money back or something?
26656,"Yikes, you gotta pay more attention to your textbook maybe"
26657,I hope you do well and pass the exam!
26658,That's too bad. Maybe you can call them?
26659,"I hear you. Just think in the old days you would have to write letters, lol."
26660,"Yikes, that's really cruel of him to do that. I'm sure you're trying the best you can"
26661,"Don't mind them, everyone has a tough time everynow and then. You'll be okay"
26662,"Wow, that is nice. What does he understand?"
26663,That is cool.
26664,Who left all the dirty dishes?
26665,Does she have a job?
26666,"Good for you, have a beer for me!"
26667,"Dang, I'm seriously about to go get one now you made me jealous.  Not even lying."
26668,It's always good when a friend meets his potential
26669,You got to stay focused and make that money. Don't want the world to pass you by
26670,oh my goodness that is horrible. how come it didn't recognize you?
26671,awww that is so sad. i hope it recognizes you after some time together.
26672,What's wrong? What are you visiting the doctor for?
26673,"Yes, definitely get a blood test so you know what you need to watch out for"
26674,Oh no! before he got to have it?
26675,"Oh ok, thats not as bad.  I thought it was before he got a chance to blow out the candles"
26676,"Why, did someone cancel on you?"
26677,"Oh, well it'll come in soon enough, you can look forward to it next weekend"
26678,What was high school like for you?
26679,"Oh, that's awful. I'm really sorry. So do the songs bring back bad memories?"
26680,That's great! How far along is she?
26681,"Hahaha, sounds like a great time, you should prepare some games to play at the party"
26682,That is infuriating. I dont see how some people are so unaware.
26683,I feel you. Some people just suck.
26684,Oh nice. Any big plans for it?
26685,"That's awesome. The beach is always a good time, especially when the weather is nice!"
26686,"That's sad, how old was your pet izzy"
26687,All iguana's go to heaven so I'm sure he is
26688,Well that's quite the accomplishment! How did you train her?
26689,"Aha of course, the oldest operant conditioning trick in the book. I love it!"
26690,Sorry to hear that.  You get it fixed already or what
26691,It's good to have reliable friends.
26692,Awesome.  Sounds like you are defintely on top of the world today!
26693,What kind of money we talking?  Lottery money?
26694,Oh my! I hope that it goes well!
26695,I'm sure it will be ok. It's probably nothing. 
26696,oh how exciting. what grade was it from?
26697,that is so sweet. it would be fun if you have children so you can share it with them.
26698,What is the longest you have been apart?
26699,Yea that will be a little lonely for sure. Just try and stay productive as much as possible.
26700,"Wow, that must be exciting. Do you have everything prepared?"
26701,Nice! Make sure to take lots of photos and make some cool memories together!
26702,"Whoa, that is quite the confession. But you know, it's good that you recognize that you need to change a behavior. Very mature. Not everyone has that same ability to be honest with themselves, and you should feel proud about that!"
26703,"I know, and I know it can be really hard to deal with that guilt. You want to solve the problem though, and that's still worth something. Being able to take the little victories will go a long way toward the goal you want in terms of how you treat your husband."
26704,I've always gone by if you learned from your mistakes you have no reason to regret them
26705,It's good you've grown and learned. Never stop 
26706,Oh that is awful. I have been fired before it is just the worst. Have things gotten better since then?
26707,It defintiely sounds bad.
26708,That is good. Is it your manager who did the review?
26709,i hate when that happens. my dreams are always so vivid they feel real.
26710,oh my word. that is like a nightmare not a bad dream.
26711,i'm so sorry you had to go thru that.
26712,Oh no I hope everything goes well!
26713,Well I hope that it all goes your way!
26714,Do you live on a farm? It will probably be nice to move to a city and get away from those chickens.
26715,What are you going to do with the chickens?
26716,do you do it out of necessity or because of the thrill of it?
26717,how about you get some of the same food for yourself?
26718,I don't think that being bossy. You are just really concerned with getting a job done efficiently 
26719,What games did you liked?
26720,I like a lot COD. It is one of my favorites.
26721,"Just wear cologne, dress sharp, use mouthwash, and let her do all the talking.  And you'll be just fine"
26722,That's good.  Just stay away from the beans and spicy food haha
26723,That sounds awesome! I wish I could go!
26724,That sounds like a really good time. It will be like you are a kid again!
26725,Aw I am sorry to hear that. I'm sure he was a good pet.
26726,Oh wow. Pets can be just like family members. It's hard to lose them I know.
26727,Why? What are you worried about?
26728,Just try to relax and not worry so much. Yes something bad could happen but there's also a chance nothing goes wrong. Having anxiety about something can be hard to overcome but you can do it :)
26729,I loved playing that!  They look so outdated now.  Good times!
26730,That must have been the most epic Christmas ever!  I think someone gave us ours but I can't remember.  Makes me want to play now!
26731,Whoa congrats. You must be very excited.
26732,That is so awesome. Im sure it will be a very fun day to share with everyone.
26733,oh my goodness that is horrid. i'd think with hot water and degreaser.
26734,haha. you are very welsome. that's what happens after years of dirty microwave cleaning.
26735,Oh wow where are they?
26736,Why are they in a  place so far away from you? Are you away at college?
26737,Oh no! I'm so sorry are you going to be alright?
26738,Oh god I'm so sorry for you! I hope everything goes well
26739,I would be afraid one of them would get out!
26740,Have you held any of your friend's spiders?
26741,That sounds like it could be a great success.  Do you both work well together?
26742,I hope its a major triumph for you both!  
26743,Nice how old are they
26744,Nice you seem pretty open minded about so I'm sure you'll handle yourself well.
26745,"oh, thats embarassing.  I hate it when that happens.   "
26746,"haha, well maybe they didn't want to embarass you."
26747,"Ew, yeah it is not worth risking getting food poisoning!"
26748,"Yes, need to check those sell by dates. Meat may only be good for a few days afterwards."
26749,Oh no! Have you already had some tests or is this the first time?
26750,I'm so sorry to hear. What is the problem?
26751,"Ah ok, yeah my partner has had similar issues recently. I really hope it all works out for you!"
26752,"That is so exciting, how long do you have to wait tell you find out if you are accepted or not?"
26753,I am sure you have worked very hard to get to this place! 
26754,That is great news!  I am sure he feels a great deal of accomplisment
26755,I hope he enjoys his new job and can celebrate
26756,That sounds so annoying!
26757,I hope they finish up soon. That could drive someone crazy going on for so long.
26758,Really? How come?
26759,That is very disappointing. Maybe next time text or talk on the phone a little bit to see if you will have something in common.
26760,"Ah ok, it is fine"
26761,Oh no! What do you think had happened or triggered it?
26762,Hope she recovers and feels better overall soon. That can be quite the scare!
26763,They are really impressive.  What circus was it?
26764,Have you ever gotten to go to a Cirque du Soliel?  If you like acrobats you would love that!
26765,I suggest a Night Owl surveillance system.
26766,That's the worst. I have that happen all the time but with onions.  Its the only thing they have to do so get it right!
26767,Did you have them get you a new one plus give you your money back for having to taste that nastiness?
26768,Why would you be worried? Do you have three arms?
26769,Sounds to me like you need to build your self-confidence a bit more.
26770,how come. is their something wrong with it?
26771,oh my goodness. is that not covered by the water company since it's technically their meter?
26772,I hope they come back with the desired result.  Good luck
26773,Nice do you mind sharing what it was...my mom had a cyst in her ovaries but it ended up being benign
26774,"Oh I feel you! I have full control over my schedule, it is so nice!"
26775,Part time self employed and part time just employed by a company. The company lets me choose my shifts though so... still full control.
26776,"oh wow, that does suck! Hopefully you can push it to another day this week."
26777,"Defenitly, and employers can be unreasonable sometimes."
26778,Thats awesome what kind of car is it.
26779,have you always wanted a jeep they seem pretty fun to drive.
26780,Did the entire class laugh at you?
26781,I haven't peed my pants ever. Guess I am just lucky.
26782,Why did your dog do it.
26783,My Japanese spitz did that once...lady was waving a bone around and pulling back...til he caught her with one snap and almost bit her finger clean off
26784,You must be a little jealous.  Maybe its time to save up for your own dream car?
26785,I mean pro's and con's... right?
26786,Oh no!  That is disappointing.  Did you have to run out and get more?
26787,"Well, I guess one night without beer is not going to kill you.  "
26788,Oh boy I hope you get some sleep tonight!
26789,you got it bro!
26790,Did you know all the answers?  I wouldn't be too good at it.
26791,"Wow, impressive!  I'd have to get some category like Kids or Nutrition to know much of anything. ha ha"
26792,"That is awful, those movies are pretty good minus the george clooney and ben afflack films."
26793,You need to go see them and overcome your fear of bats
26794,"I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully you qualify for unemployment while you get back on your feet."
26795,Are you in a right to work state? Here in my state they don't have to have a reason.
26796,Oh no! I have the same problem at my work! How do you deal with it?
26797,Yeah it can be hard. I resorted to wearing noise cancelling headphones myself!
26798,I'm sure it'll go fine! Are you doing okay?
26799,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope the doctor can give you some treatment options. 
26800,Now that's quite a gift! Are you going to take her to any games as a thank you?
26801,I've been looking forward to it starting too. Not a lot going on at the moment. But that's wonderful to hear!
26802,What happens next.
26803,Well I guess it worked itself out. 
26804,I undersand. Do you want to strangle me?
26805,That does sound scary.  I would have used my phone flashlight
26806,brought back some old memories?
26807,That was nice of you to help them.  What did you do to help?
26808,"Wow, that sounds really complicated.  I could never do that.  Id send you a thank you card too"
26809,What talents do you speak of?
26810,That's pretty cool.   Do you go to the circus often?
26811,That's amazing to hear.  There is nothing like a great relationship!
26812,Bad ones definatley make the good one a treasure.  Have you been together long?
26813,That is a good long time!  I am sure you have many more ahead of you!
26814,When you appreciate something that much it's sure to continue that way!  I've been married 19 years and love almost every minute!
26815,"Ah, that's unfortunate. That can be really tough to remember sometimes. I know because I've forgotten that too. But you'll make it up as soon as you can, I'm sure!"
26816,"As long as it's not too delinquent, and you have an otherwise good history of on-time payments, you should be okay! Try talking to your loan servicer, too. They can help."
26817,Did they leave a note or anything?  I would be really upset too.  Were there any cameras that could have seen who did it?
26818,Thats the worst.  I would feel so awful if I left a dent and fleed the scene of the crime.  Hopefully the guilt is eating away at that person.
26819,I will try my best.
26820,Well that's...kinda funny not gonna lie
26821,haha well hey it happens to the best of us...I do it around my friends all the time
26822,That is awesome. you must be very excited.
26823,I bet. It will be great to have some time to unwind and not think about it.
26824,What makes you unsure?
26825,you should do a test drive and apply some math to the pay difference to decide if its worth it.
26826,How fun! What kind of pet is it?
26827,"My kids want one of those, but we have to wait until the youngest is old enough. So cute!"
26828,Aww! I bet that is so exciting! Do you want a girl or boy?
26829,I hope it goes well. Children are great.
26830,I am glad you grew out of your shell.
26831,I was really neither.
26832,"Dang nice! Bugattis are freakin slick, definitely a dream car...what does your friend do"
26833,"Well that makes sense.  And I'm sure you can do the same in good time, just stay hungry and be about your paper!"
26834,I'm sorry to hear that! It sounds like an honest mistake. 
26835,"Oh wow, defenitly sounds like he was too focused on video games. Maybe talk to him about how it made you feel so you don't get resentful. "
26836,"Uh oh, were you alone? Hopefully you didn't have to go very far! That can be super scary for sure."
26837,Well that's just the worst. At least you're okay now! I don't know how you managed it.
26838,Nice did you prepare well for it
26839,Awesome good luck
26840,Oh man that's rough... maybe you should think about moving?
26841,I would have been so embarrassed! Hopefully you didn't get hurt at all
26842,Could have been worse! 
26843,did someone help you?
26844,I hate working on the weekend.  Do you have to work this weekend
26845,oh nice.  Thatll be fun.
26846,oh my god that is so scary. what did you do?
26847,that is awesome at least you didn't get hurt. that's what is important
26848,That is annoying. Did you told your manager about it?
26849,Why she doesn't want to do anything about it?
26850,oh my god. i am so sorry. i have two sisters and know that pain.
26851,that is horrible. i hope that your family can really cope thru this difficult time.
26852,"That is good, I am sure your boss loves that."
26853,You should talk to her about that.
26854,"Hahaha, I dont mean to laugh but I'm assuming he is young and kids are pretty funny.  Did anyone else see it happen?"
26855,I'm sure the other people thought kids will be kids.  He'll learn eventually!
26856,"Now that's just not right! Weekends are supposed to be for relaxing and hanging out with friends, not slaving away for the man! Hopefully you didn't have to cancel any plans..."
26857,"Wow, that really sucks, I'm sorry to hear that. You deserve to take yourself some vacation time or sick time or something."
26858,"You can do it, you just need to start right away"
26859,Just putting away a little still helps
26860,i always feel like i'm on top of the world after i workout. 
26861,i must agree. even when i get spaghetti legs i must say it's worth the rush that comes with it.
26862,what project is that
26863,Wow. Is he doing this for a show or a competition?
26864,Terrible. So he is making himself unhealthy for a t shirt.
26865,What kind would you get
26866,Oh cute.  I have one.  SHe is the nicest dog
26867,Did you discipline her?
26868,Yeah that is always gross
26869,why what happened
26870,hopefully it works out for you
26871,Lol! Ah- Well cherish them while you can in the summers even though it can be tiring :)
26872,Well that's pretty annoying. Aren't they supposed to have people there who do that for you?
26873,"If that happens again, you should tell them they should have to pay you the appropriate wage to do work that they're supposed to be doing themselves. That's insane!"
26874,Sorry to hear that. What happens during your nightmare?
26875,Well I hope you can find some peace from those dreams.
26876,Great to have a daughter in basketball!
26877,Fantastic!
26878,"Well, maybe you won't do it again."
26879,"That is good, do you like to drink?"
26880,Do you plan to quit forever?
26881,"Me too, sometime, I had the same feeling about someone walking behind me."
26882,oh thats a nice suprise
26883,yea thats good they did
26884,"Oh, who are they playing?"
26885,That will be so fun!
26886,"I love IKEA, they have good meatballs."
26887,Hopefully you can understand the instructions.
26888,"But it's good that you made friends though, right? Will you still be able to keep in touch with them?"
26889,Well then that's all the more reason to take more trips so you can see them! Maybe go on a couchsurfing tour of the world!
26890,did you go ?
26891,"thats good, keep going!"
26892,That was rude. Did they stop
26893,Thats still tough to go through though
26894,Good luck are you hoping for a boy or girl?
26895,That is so exciting. 
26896,it will be exciting. what will you be doing?
26897,i'm sure you will do just fine. i hope that you will do well.
26898,why didnt you go ?
26899,That is a lot of meat.
26900,Did they throw up after they finished?
26901,rain storm or thunder storm?
26902,we've had some pretty bad storms here too this year. it worries me too
26903,Oh wow that sounds good to me
26904,I like memories like that
26905,what do you plan to do there
26906,That does sound a little scary
26907,It can be tough when friends have things that might be considered better than what you have.  Maybe it can be used as motivation
26908,"I am sure you are at least happy for your friend, right?"
26909,I have done that. It happens to the best of us
26910,I am sure no one really noticed
26911,oh that was awkward
26912,probably the best option
26913,What kind of pet is it?
26914,No way! They scare me :( Is it easy?
26915,Ready for what?
26916,Great. What is the test about?
26917,Thats not fair! what has he done that you havent done?
26918,Thats so annoying.  Ive been in a similar situation. Just keep working hard. Youll get there one day
26919,i cant say that i do
26920,i highly doubt that
26921,That's nice! How are you gonna spend your weekend?
26922,"Oh man, good luck! Hope you roll high."
26923,Oh wow.  I hope she's still doing well!
26924,Well good luck to her.  I know that's a tough thing to recover from.
26925,That must be nice
26926,"Yeah, I think we all wish that was possible"
26927,Oh wow. How long has your cousin been overseas?
26928,That's real nice of him. Do you miss him?
26929,Have you used it yet
26930,That is very smart
26931,Oh damn. So why'd she pick you?
26932,"Spread of that magic, my dude."
26933,Nice nothing better than homemade mom lunches...what did she bring you
26934,Stir fries are the bomb.
26935,Thats awesome. i wish i still had mine.  I sold it a couple years ago
26936,I wonder if there are any repair shops that could fix it
26937,What happened? Are you ok?
26938,I mean they could have just run your items instead of making you mad.
26939,I bet you were anxious to know how you did! Did you study up with friends or family leading up to the driver's test?
26940,"Oh well that's a bit different of a situation, lol. I gotcha! I didn't know you had to retake the test if you accidentally let it expire. But I'm sure you did great!"
26941,"That's awesome! I'm proud of you, buddy."
26942,Oh sweet. What number tattoo is it?
26943,That's pretty awesome. What is it gonna be of?
26944,What did you cook
26945,That sounds very good right now
26946,That's great to hear. Are you usually really busy?
26947,"That's crazy. Well, I hope you have an awesome weekend!"
26948,what kind of cake are you going to get ?
26949,that does sound good
26950,oh thats awesome
26951,keep it up!
26952,Woah!  Bet he was digesting for days!
26953,That is amazing.  He should be on one of those food shows to see how much he can eat.
26954,Oh no that is truly tragic. People dont appreciate the older novelties
26955,You dont know what you got till its gone.. lol the ignorance!!!
26956,I could be wrong...but I feel like they just miss your company...and are using your grandma as a scapegoat.  Don't be so hard on them they're not always gonna be around ;)
26957,"You must have a good, positive energy and that's what they miss.  I used to be the same.  But when they're dead and gone you'll miss the pestering so love them for who they are, you're still free to make your own choices. Peace"
26958,Do you make them for a living or as a hobby?
26959,I've never even attempted something so huge. You must be very creative and precise. 
26960,I hope you will be able to heal from this. 
26961,wow how do you do it?
26962,dang that sucks.. hopefully it pay well
26963,Oh no. No one available to walk you part way or anything?
26964,Did anything happen?
26965,Sounds like a lot of fun! I'm sure it'll be a great date to bond.
26966,Yes defenitly! Go on the ferris wheel and buy her some cotton candy :)
26967,"Aw, that's sweet. What kind of pet is it? Did you wish you could steal it so it could be yours instead?"
26968,"Hmm, I don't think I've ever known anyone who has a bearded dragon before actually. That's really cool though! Did you let the two of y'alls bearded dragons ever interact?"
26969,"Ah ah, have fun."
26970,"That is so cool, what was the project?"
26971,"That is so awesome, so it was a real life advanced battle bots.  So amazing.  Congratulations!"
26972,You must be so excited!
26973,"Wow, that's awful but you know, we all make dumb mistakes like that in desperate times."
26974,That is so wonderful that you give your parents the credit and are so grateful for what they did for you!
26975,I hope my kids say the same thing about me helping them that much when they grow up.
26976,You must cook a lot of tasty food all the time!
26977,hmm did you try calling pest control
26978,yea thats true
26979,i wish i could do that too
26980,"Yeah, that does sound a little scary"
26981,Good for you. How did you know what that meant?
26982,Very nice. I need to learn some new words.
26983,"That sounds awesome, were are you going if you don't mind?"
26984,Nice! The summer is the perfect time for the beach.
26985,I remember my wife saying that when she was pregnant with both of ours.  How far along are you?
26986,That is a very long time.  Is this your first?
26987,Ugh I've been there before... What do they do?
26988,Eeeewwww... some people have no shame
26989,That's great news to hear!
26990,same thing happened to me.. i believe it 
26991,they dont care about you unless you got tons of money in their back
26992,is she coming back ?
26993,oh yea .. well you can facetime or video chat in the meantime!
26994,That would be awesome. What would you do with the winnings?
26995,hahaha have you ever been to Hawaii?
26996,They're checking you out or they're glaring at you?
26997,Ha ha!  Guess they like what they see! 
26998,4 is still a baby for me...but i'd start treating him like a man
26999,I love hondas.  Are you jealous of that person?
27000,"I know that feeling, friend."
27001,Is it for a special event?
27002,I hope you are able to get it done in time - I love cheesecake so I'm jealous I won't be there to eat it!
27003,Oh god. Was it big?
27004,Wow. Does it happen often then?
27005,"That's awesome, she sounds multi faceted."
27006,"That's human, when you live for a while you don't have to get stuff right the first time."
27007,"Oh yeah baby, that sounds awesome. I don't know what it is, but those ""buy in bulk"" stores' food cafes always have INSANE pizza. I'm jealous!"
27008,"Believe me, I've eaten my fair share of it. My stepmom used to take me and my brother there when we were younger. I'll always have fond memories of it. But you're right, I do need to go back and get some more sometime!"
27009,"Wow that sounds exciting and anxiety-inducing at the same time, hope it turns out well for you."
27010,Well it's good you have some friendly support in case it goes poorly.
27011,Oh wow. How many have they had now? lol
27012,Oh not that much really.
27013,"Wow, that's a huge step. Are you excited?"
27014,I'm sure it'll be amazing
27015,Oh wow. I'm impressed he can make furniture! Is he busy?
27016,Awww give him some time. I'm sure he'll get to it eventually.
27017,Oh no!  Did you overdraw your account?
27018,"Ugh, its the worst. I've had that happen a few times to me.  Like a punch to the gut."
27019,"Well, you definitely deserve it then!"
27020,How much of a raise are you getting?
27021,You sound like a very good friend!
27022,I wish I had a friend like you.
27023,"I love ice cream cake, did you enjoy it?"
27024,"Its just cake, there will always be another cake"
27025,"I know what you mean, no one can get to you like your mom. But they are awesome."
27026,"Oh yes, to be raised by or spend as much time with their family. It sure is a crazy world."
27027,Oh damn. Did you do something to upset your dog?
27028,Oh no. Did something bad happen?
27029,they got a ton of worker bees following their command
27030,I'm sorry to hear that. Will you get a day off soon?
27031,I'll pray for ya! You need a break before you burn out.
27032,I guess its an insect?
27033,I guess you have to asks its creator
27034,Oh I get you. It's been raining here everyday.
27035,"I hope you get some sun where you are, too. Too much rain can get depressing."
27036,Now that is one of the most unfortunate things I've heard all week. How did you get it out of your hair? Eeww
27037,"That, I think, is a pretty justifiable response honestly, lol. Now at the very least all you'll have to do is clean the umbrella!"
27038,Wow. That's pretty amazing. You have been through quite a lot in life.
27039,"Hopefully, it'll be smooth sailing from no onwards."
27040,"Oohh...if you're the girl that's ok...if you're a guy c'mon buddy, bring some cash lol"
27041,Tsk tsk gotta have a backup.  Nothing turns a girl off more than having to pay for everything...they like the feeling of security
27042,How much is the jackpot?
27043,That is a whole lot of money!
27044,you were too good for them anyway!
27045,im sure you will do great where ever you end up going
27046,You must be a great student!
27047,I wish you more success in your education.
27048,Yikes. Why did you take it may I ask?
27049,"Ah, well if you haven't sold it yet, there's still time to return it!"
27050,where were you all going to go ?
27051,oh that sounds like fun
27052,I feel like I have heard that a lot tonight
27053,Why are you surprised she asked you out? 
27054,A lot of girls don't follow the traditional ways anymore.
27055,"It is kind of odd to look at ourselves from that long ago, and we didn't even realize what we looked like usually at that time."
27056,It's like you're looking at someone else almost.
27057,Why did they cancel
27058,I guess work does that sometimes
27059,"Impressive! It is all going to be well worth it in the long run, keep going ghost rider!"
27060,"If theres a will then theres a way! Er in most situations, were not talking about you trying to do brain surgery tomorrow or anything. "
27061,Haha. That would have scared me so much.
27062,You never know with those cats. They are very sly.
27063,Oh I hope it does! I bet you've got a super secret ingredient that makes it stand out from the rest of the rabble.
27064,"Then it will be appropriate if it pays off for you. If you win first prize, I'm gonna need you to start getting it put in grocery stores so I can buy some!"
27065,what does she say ?
27066,oh no. this sounds bad.
27067,I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you tried calling your local shelther or animal control?
27068,"Oh, sometimes you just have to accept weather changing your plans. I am sure you can go another time."
27069,That's a bummer. Well I hope you can find another weekend to make up for it.
27070,wow. a cruise sounds pretty amazing. where to?
27071,"Oh man. You'll get to spend time with the family, too. that's what's up."
27072,I know right!  Asian food is pricey.
27073,Wow! That's pretty amazing. How are you gonna spend it?
27074,"hahaha still in shock, hu? Well, as long as it's the good of shock. :)"
27075,Oh no what happened?
27076,Do you think that if you apologized they would forgive you?
27077,Why did you do that
27078,"I understand, people do it all of the time"
27079,why ? im sure you will be fine
27080,Were you able to find your dog?
27081,Oh damn. Me too. What area are you in?
27082,Northeast here. Must be raining all along the coast.
27083,Are you happy with that
27084,I guess it was just meant to be then
27085,Omg that is awful. How long did it take to recover? 
27086,I bet! I am glad it wasn't even for serious than it was already.
27087,"I know, I can't wait either!"
27088,I am rooting for the Longhorns!
27089,I guess people are way more rude these days arent they
27090,"I do miss that as well, maybe it will come back"
27091,"Oh, that's got to feel rough. It's not quite the same, but I've felt similarly when I couldn't get previous ex-girlfriends gifts during holidays or their birthdays or something. But I'm sure she knows you love her anyway."
27092,"It does. Feeling bad about it is enough to show you care about her, which is something, paradoxically, to feel good about I think. Just keep being a good dad to her. :)"
27093,That is great. How old is she?
27094,"At this age, they are cute."
27095,You couldn't say no to working?
27096,That is a real bummer.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  Will you be able to reschedule your plans?
27097,I am sorry it didn't work out. But happy to hear you are happy now.
27098,"That is so wonderful, because that doesn't normally happen."
27099,That must be annoying!
27100,I hope that gets resolved soon.
27101,Yikes. Mine was 210.
27102,Turn the AC up a little :)
27103,It looks good. Should I save my money?
27104,"I thought the name was dumb too, but the previews looked awesome. Is it scary at all because I don't llike anthing remotel scary"
27105,That sounds soooo good! I'm eating low-carb right now but I'm a pushover for good mashed potatoes!
27106,"LOL!  I've done things like that before also, sometimes you just need some me time with some good food ya know?"
27107,"Oh no, I hate when that happens"
27108,"Good luck, lots of coffee!"
27109,"I think it is, that might make you feel better"
27110,Its the perfect time to go see them then
27111,That is tough. Was it a big lie?
27112,You must be feeling pretty guilty. That sucks. 
27113,What kind of test was it
27114,I am sure you will do better next time
27115,Oh gross! That must have been disgusting to see.
27116,"Wow, I can only imagine what other gross things she does."
27117,Is that a video game?  Is it Mario?
27118,I used to LOVE Mario Kart - I'm not a big video game fan but I loved that one.  I can see why you are excited about it coming out!
27119,What exactly did you see?
27120,"Wow that's very annoying, he should be arrested."
27121,"Wow, how amazing is that!? I wish someone would do that for me! I mean, I don't think I buy more than $30 of groceries at a time since it's just me, but still!"
27122,"That's a wonderful idea, I love that! And you know, if you find you can't quite do the exact same thing for someone else, you can always donate food to a food bank or something. It's the exact same thing, and it'll make you feel awesome."
27123,Oh that sucks! Maybe you can go the next day.
27124,Do you normally go very often?
27125,oh wow! that is horrible!! did they get away with it?
27126,i am sorry to hear that. that is a bad incident to have happen on vacation
27127,That is so exciting.  Is this your first?
27128,"I guess you have a plan to induce labor, or a scheduled C-section?"
27129,"Oh, Do you think you did something wrong? "
27130,That's terrible I wouldn't like for that to happen to me.
27131,Where did you go and what happened?
27132,"That's too bad, did you get to the second place after?"
27133,What are they coming to fix?
27134,"Oh my my, hope it gets fixed fast"
27135,Woohooo... I bet you're ecstatic
27136,I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to go to school lol 
27137,That's great.
27138,I know how that feels. Its a good feeling to be on the right path finally
27139,That sounds like a neat tradition. What did you guys do with the apples once they were all picked?
27140,Sounds like a bunch of tasty items! My mom used to make a banging apple pie whenever I came home for Thanksgiving. It was the best feeling in the world eating it.
27141,That is amazing!  I'm so happy for you!  What kind of car did they get you?
27142,"Hey, a new car is a new car!  I'm dying from heat in my car since the A/C broke.  Have fun driving!"
27143,That's awesome! How long do you think it will take you to build it?
27144,Is this the first time you've put a computer together?
27145,"Ah, I know that feeling well. My family moved around a ton while I was in grade school, so I don't really have many long term friends. Don't worry though, you'll make friends at your new job so easily, you won't even remember you didn't have friends!"
27146,"I mean yeah, it can't hurt, can it? I'm sure they'll be excited to meet you and get to know you as much as vice versa. Plus, who knows? Your new best friend might be in there for all you know!"
27147,That bad huh? what was wrong with'em
27148,They? you went on a date with more than one person??
27149,That can be a scary thing to see
27150,"I like cats, but not those kind of cats"
27151,That does sound lonely. Do you have friends to turn to?
27152,Well thats good. If you can find a hobby to occupy those evenings that would be best.
27153,Oh no!  Are you hurt?  Don't even worry about them. It happens to the best of us.
27154,I'm glad you're okay.  It is so embarrassing.  I've done that before but at least you got back up!  Pride can heal and a body takes longer to! 
27155,I bet! I am still too scared to ride one.
27156,Maybe I should get over my fear and finally ride one.
27157,That's really sweet of him. How long have you been friends?
27158,What do you guys like to do for fun?
27159,"Aw, that's too bad. What kind of restaurant was it?"
27160,"Dang, what I would do for some sweet chinese now. Did you find one to replace it?"
27161,I'm sorry to hear that. Adolph must've had a happy life though.
27162,Man. What was it like having a armadillo as a pet?
27163,That's really sad. Were you close to him?
27164,I am sorry to hear that. I was pretty distraught when I lost my granddad as well. May he rest in peace.
27165,It sounds like a big opportunity for you.  Are you ready for it?
27166,"Good luck, I'm sure you will do well."
27167,What in the world. Are they doing drugs?
27168,"Omg, I would be videoing it for sure lol"
27169,What's your favorite Mexican sweet?
27170,I have never had any either. I hope you enjoy them!
27171,That's pretty nice! I haven't been skating in a coon's age. Is the rink nice?
27172,That's great! I may look it up and go to their grand opening as well.
27173,Oh you've definitely done your part to prepare. Good luck!
27174,What is the position for?
27175,"I love reminiscing like that, I hope they were all good memories!"
27176,I'm glad!  It's funny how we can look back and be able to remember the good times!
27177,That seems really nice actually. I do have a few close female friends.
27178,You must really trust these people. Yall must have been friends for a long time.
27179,On no! Did you report it?
27180,Was it a really expensive one?
27181,"That's awesome, It's nice to have friends that are role models"
27182,Hard work is always rewarded!
27183,That's great. Where are y'all from?
27184,I visited once there. The people are very nice.
27185,Why does that bother you?
27186,Sometimes thats the best option.
27187,ah thats so bad!! did you fix it yet?
27188,you would be irritated for couple of days then 
27189,Well dang man. It's never too late! Just hit her up on the ole Facebook!
27190,I am sure you two will be having babies in no time if you hit her up right this instant!
27191,"awww sorry bout your rug...there's a facebook group called doggo you should follow...owners post pics of their dogs with signs around their necks like ""I like jumping out of moving cars just to poop in front of strangers"" you might be less mad looking at them haha"
27192,Yup.  But here's a link https://www.facebook.com/doggocom/photos/pcb.511713622609187/511711852609364/?type=3&theater
27193,what does that mean?
27194,OH like a raise? If you worked hard they should give it to you
27195,oh how did you miss that?
27196,ah thats so bad!!. You are right in this age we need to get rid of this written checks
27197,Oh what happened? Did your car break down?
27198,Ohh I feel bad for you. I am sure everything going to be alright.
27199,I haven't but I am familiar with it.
27200,What team does he play for?
27201,That's really great to hear. It's always good to prepare for big events like that. What's the meeting about?
27202,I am sure you're going to crush it into the ground.
27203,That is great to hear. Are you good at math?
27204,I hope you do well then
27205,"Right, sometimes I feel the same way when I feel like I should have something, but then I realize I would get bored from it after a while like everything"
27206,"Yeah, and it's just one more thing you have to keep track of"
27207,Ohh. Good for him. Some guys are born lucky
27208,Ohh don't feel bad. I am sure someday you will get one.
27209,You are so brave to do that!
27210,Your dog is very lucky!
27211,"ive had one dogg that I love, but since she did its been hard to love again."
27212,yeah she was an older family dog.
27213,"Engaging in conversation, whether the spoken or written word helps to further communication along."
27214,You are doing a great job ! You are following our conversation naturally.
27215,Did he at least take you out to lunch with the winnings?
27216,Maybe you will win next time.
27217,I cant imagine seeing one in real life. I would be so scared.
27218,I dont think I could go anywhere where they may be. Its terrifying to think about.
27219,I agree. That is rude and annoying. How do you handle it?
27220,I generally tend to start walking away from them.
27221,Holy cow! I think I would have passed out if I was you!
27222,"Oh wow, You probably shouldn't be drinking and driving tho."
27223,"I am sure that makes you feel bad, have you talked to them about how you feel?"
27224,That is a sticky situation to be in
27225,Oh I'm glad you got it! Did someone call out for you?
27226,You had that instinct. 
27227,I would be happy too if I had that. What kind of cat do you have?
27228,"Aw, well it's good that you guys took him in. You're a kind sould."
27229,I think some kids go through that. Did your parents comfort you?
27230,Oh no. Did you get much sleep as a kid at all?
27231,Oh god. That must be terrifying.
27232,Oh lord. They're still there?
27233,That sounds very fortunate. Good timing.
27234,Pets are amazing in that way. Glad he was there for you when you needed it.
27235,"Boy, what I would do for a slice o that right now. What kind of pizza is it?"
27236,"Dang, I bet that'll be better than that racist Papa John's pizza!"
27237,"Oh god. Well, at least it died nice and full."
27238,I'm sure it was! Kinda feel bad for it.
27239,That sounds exciting! The seminar will be a great time to connect with your bosses
27240,Great! I'm so happy that your hard work was worth it!
27241,"Oh really, cat does like that?"
27242,ah thats horrible. Did you take her to the doctor's?
27243,Oh man. Did you get a chance to say goodbye?
27244,hm must've been a big goldfish.
27245,That's pretty cool. Maybe you could toss me a few recipes for recently deceased goldfish?
27246,"No, no! I swear I don't! I meant the cracker goldfish! The crackers!!!"
27247,On no! Did you get hurt?
27248,I bet! I would be too! I am so sorry that happened to you.
27249,"That's exciting! I have no idea how that sport is even played, but I'm glad you go to go see it! Did the team you were rooting for win?"
27250,"I will definitely be on the lookout for it. That is awesome though, you were supporting your team! You may have been all by yourself, but you were the only one getting to celebrate! Hell yeah, brother!"
27251,"Well, you can call her today and make up for it?"
27252,Wow how did that happen?? 
27253,Well I'm sure you figured out your mistake right away!
27254,You should do it.  I think you'll do great.
27255,Where are you going to go on your first date?
27256,I'm so sorry to hear that. Why did it happen?
27257,"Yea. So you didn't get that warning not to date crazy, hu?"
27258,"Oh gross, did you spit it back out?"
27259,Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Maybe it's not that bad? just drink a lot of water
27260,"That's terrible, my friend. Is there a chance to get it in the near future?"
27261,I am sure you will. Just gotta keep kicking butt and taking names!
27262,"Ugh, I hate that!  What are they doing to irritate you?"
27263,That's horrible - can you complain the complex or HOA?   Or figure out a way to cut their power is always an option?
27264,Thats going to take forever
27265,Aw. I do that too. I still have my old cell phones with videos of mt babies doing nothing lol
27266,hm is there a reason you are going? have you been experiencing chronic pain?
27267,That sucks. I hope it helps!
27268,Pets are great companions.  Mine follow me around everywhere and I am sure you cat does the same thing
27269,Animals are pretty intuitive.  That are great at picking up people's moods I have found
27270,Oh yeah? Was it any good?
27271,Oh I see. What made you finally decide to try it out?
27272,well that is def a big decision to consider
27273,it is a life changer for sure. it will change the everyday activities in your life
27274,That's exciting! What car did you get?
27275,"Great car! I love Subarus, my favorite is the impreza with turbo"
27276,"Aw, that's so sweet. Why would you say such a thing?"
27277,Sounds like a great girlfriend. I am sure she will be around for whenever you need her like you did last week.
27278,Oh sounds exciting! How'd it go
27279,I should try it one day! Were you afraid of heights?
27280,Oh what was it about? Was it for an event?
27281,That sounds like a touching moment. How wonderful for you!
27282,Ohh that's bad. How did you feel?
27283,"Ohh I am so sorry. That one's my favorite too! But, I feel bad for you."
27284,I am sure you had a really good reason right?
27285,"Oh wow, I hope you get some help soon."
27286,ah that's so sad. You would miss your favorite one. i think you need to find something else
27287,You will definitely will 
27288,That must've really upset you. Did they explain why?
27289,Definitely take some time to vent out your anger. It's totally undestandable.
27290,Wow! What platform was it for? Nintendo or Atari or Sony?
27291,"Sounds like you had a great childhood, you can try playing it now by downloading an emulator haha, I tried that and it was great"
27292,thats nice of you to rely on a friend.
27293,then you got good set of friends. Don't lose them for your life!!
27294,"Alright, I can get behind that. Sisters-in-law are usually angry messes of human beings anyway, so I'll back you up on that. What did she do though?"
27295,"Yeah that's pretty unacceptable. As a former teacher myself, I can assure you that as much as I loved those kids, my kids would always come first no matter what."
27296,"That's too bad. In all fairness, no one really needs a good car. I have a beater, but it's get me from place to place. That's all that really matters."
27297,I am sure you'll reach your goal one day. I do hope you get that brand spanking new car.
27298,did you say something
27299,did your girlfriend like that
27300,I hope you do well on it! Do you feel prepared?
27301,That's great! Make sure to check your answers twice!
27302,I do too! Love going out and swimming in the ocean. Why do you like going?
27303,I love doing that too and the price is totally worth it.
27304,Being alone or going bowling - or both?
27305,I'd get some new friends that's for sure!!  It stinks when they don't stick with you!
27306,"Oh man, what are you getting that for? I hope everything is okay."
27307,I am sure. I do hope that they find the cause.
27308,what was the gift ? i can imagine it was something wonderful.
27309,was it colorful or did it play a tune ? 
27310,Are there any favorite tunes that it plays ?
27311,did you try clear it?
27312,"okay do it continue, it will clear"
27313,I can relate.  What's the saddest movie you've ever watched?
27314,"Yea, that's a really emotional one for a lot of people.  I see that one mentioned a lot for tear jerkers."
27315,That's terrible! Are the police doing anything about it?
27316,"Oh man. Well, be careful out there. Wouldn't want anything to happen to you or your family."
27317,"Me too, sometimes I still get scared to stare into mirrors in the dark"
27318,"Hahaha, me too definitely"
27319,"Yikes, did it take long to clean it up?"
27320,"Well I hope your dog is feeling better, it would be bad if he was feeling sick or stressed"
27321,I am sure you will present a stellar product. What is the powerpoint on?
27322,Sounds pretty cool. I am sure he will end up investing.
27323,Oh yeah? What is the name?
27324,Oh ok. That is a realy good show. I watch it too.
27325,That's too bad. Do you have any friends or other family that you can do that with?
27326,I am sure. I do hope you find peace with your football watching and your good ole dad.
27327,Thats gross. Did you punish the dog at all
27328,"Poor dog, I hope she learns from it"
27329,Really? What was his first word?
27330,That is a really complex word!
27331,That's really great to hear. I love my wife too. What does she do that make you appreciate her every day?
27332,Mine does the same! It's nice coming home to a clean house everyday.
27333,Ah that must have been surprise for you
27334,You should also reach out to  her
27335,"I do feel bad for them as well, its tough to see"
27336,People have to look after themselves
27337,"Wow, that's amazing! I'm insanely jealous! I think it's pretty normal to be scared of that though. After all, it wouldn't be nearly as much fun if it didn't terrify you, right?"
27338,"Exactly! Embrace the danger. Become the danger. Do like 800 flips while you're falling through the air, but do yourself a favor and don't vomit okay?"
27339,ah thats really gross!!. I hate it road authority do not clear dead animals from the roads asap
27340,We need to do an online petition and raise a complaint against authority!!
27341,Nice! Is it your first time buying?
27342,Good to hear. I hope the house warming party is banging.
27343,OMG. I think I would have passed out.
27344,Did you take the time to walk her outside?
27345,ah thats so sad. why did she is leaving her though?
27346,i am so sure you will miss her. Keep in touch with her though
27347,Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that
27348,"I bet, stay strong!"
27349,Nice! Did you get the job?
27350,"Wow...I am really sorry, friend. Any other interviews lined up?"
27351,I hate when that happens and I dont even have a dog
27352,are there places you can take the dog where they teach them not to do that
27353,I'm sorry.  It happens to all of us.
27354,I am sure you can go back.
27355,Yeah? Is it decorated well or just very large?
27356,"Wow, I bet. He must make a lot of money!"
27357,I feel the same way. I never thought kids could be that mean!
27358,It is so sad. I worry everyday about my school age kids.
27359,What kind of ladder was it
27360,You can always try again tomorrow
27361,"thats amazing, and also i would be a little envious, I just want love."
27362,"I believe its out there for all of us, we just gotta find it."
27363,Oh no!  hav you been out looking for her?
27364,Did you put your phone number and things on the sign?
27365,That's too bad. Maybe you should get a new one?
27366,I certainly would. How can you jam out to all the NOW CD's without it?
27367,Why didn't you want to go anywhere?
27368,"Well, in that case it's better that you just relax."
27369,"Yeah, what happened next?"
27370,Why were you not sleeping
27371,have you taken the test yet
27372,if you studied really hard then you should
27373,That's terrible. Have you confronted him about it?
27374,"I'm not sure what that means, but you should talk to him about it!"
27375,Good luck with that. Are you well prepared?
27376,I would do that too. It's a waste of money if you don't finish it!
27377,I am sorry you felt that way.
27378,On no. Did you get a letter from the IRS?
27379,Yeah I would to if I was in your position. 
27380,Oh my! What a smelly situation. Were you able to clean it up and get the smell out?
27381,Is her litter box full? My cat does that when it is too full and I neglect to clean it.
27382,That's such an awful feeling! I at least do it twice a year -_-
27383,I feel you. Last time I did that I was late for work...I hate it when it happends.
27384,"Hmmm, maybe that's because you ate it and you've got a sugar rush. I wouldn't worry! That usually fades in a couple hours. "
27385,"Eh, it's okay. Don't beat yourself up about it. It's truly a victimless crime. There are much, much worse things you could have done, I promise."
27386,I really hate when that happens
27387,next time call the police
27388,"No way, that's gross. What happened?"
27389,That's disgusting. Some people are pigs.
27390,Oh wow. Do you think you might get sick?
27391,I don't think that 's very healthy. 
27392,thats nice family should not fight forever
27393,you only get one family
27394,You must be happy for her!!
27395,ah that sucks!! but you can't help it. It's your friend's decision
27396,What a jerk! Why is she always in your biz?
27397,"I would get up in her face and show her who's boss. Break out the broom and crack it across her old, measly back!"
27398,20 pizzas!!!  How did you fit that in your stomach without it exploding?
27399,I think I'd look into entering some eating contests if I were you!
27400,Oh no... I hope it's for the best
27401,Good luck :)
27402,It's okay to have cheat days sometimes! Start again tomorrow!
27403,What type of diet are you following?
27404,That is interesting. Did you have a good time?
27405,I bet! I would be too scared to even try!
27406,I hope you can get treated.
27407,I am sure you will get better.
27408,Oh no!  Did she say anything about it?
27409,I think that as a bit harsh!  It wasn't like you did it on purpose thinking it would be funny or anything.
27410,"Wow, did that bother your co-workers?"
27411,You might want to find a new job
27412,"Ah, I certainly know the feeling of bringing back old memories. It's fun to go back and remember the people you shared all those classes with, isn't it?"
27413,"I know exactly what you mean! All the old flames, the old rivalries, everything is like it was yesterday. It's a pretty cool feeling."
27414,Awesome. Is he learning to cook for the first time?
27415,Oh wow. Well good for him! I know that makes you happy!
27416,Is that a favorite of yours?  I've never watched it.
27417,I know how you feel. I've had shows that I've loved that have ended and it's like losing a best friend.  I'm sorry it's ending.
27418,oh I only have a few more years with mine too
27419,"Yeah? Me too, I used to be afraid of aliens. What were you scared of?"
27420,Yes he could be! Maybe you should check under the bed right now. He could be watching you.
27421,What a jerk. Why doesn't he get a job at McDonalds?
27422,I would remove him from your family tree. That will show him.
27423,Credit card? That seems like an invasion of privacy
27424,"Yeah, maybe have a talk with her. Or maybe think positive, she might be getting you a gift? Haha"
27425,Story of my everyday life. I swear I ear a jingle for hours
27426,"Ugh, Its such a weird brain function."
27427,I bet! You may have to wash your car to get that smell out!
27428,lol. Hopefully that will be the last one you run over.
27429,It's good that you went easy on her.
27430,That's terrible! Did you confront them about it?
27431,Sounds like the right move. Good on you for standing up for yourself.
27432,How come? Were you scared you wouldn't wake up?
27433,"Aww, that's sad to hear. I hope you didn't lose too much sleep!"
27434,That's too bad. Have you seen a doctor about it?
27435,"Ah, makes sense. Just drink milk everyday and it should be fine in a week."
27436,That's pretty dumb. Did you eventually get the part?
27437,Ah. What a terrible inconvenience!
27438,Oh no! How are you going to clean it out?
27439,Yikes! That must have been terrible
27440,Nice! How did that feel?
27441,"Oh, how did she look? Still pretty?"
27442,wow how much
27443,thats a nice chunk of change
27444,That's really annoying. Was the wrong order any good? 
27445,"Hm.. judging from your conditions, maybe McDonald's isn't the best place for your to eat anyway! "
27446,I think thats a positive thing. Motivation is the key. Do you think he'll follow through and actually attend the gym ?
27447,you will be a great motivational coach. Such positivity !
27448,On no. Dont be too hard on yourself. You must have needed the rest.
27449,I understand. But you are human! 
27450,That's awful! Were you able to clean it off?
27451,"Oh no, I hope you can get the shoe removed from your foot."
27452,"Aw, that's exciting! I think I would swell with pride if a swear word were my kid's first word too!"
27453,"WOWAOEAOEAEOHHHH, now that was unexpected! Are you at all concerned that you're raising a Communist, or have you decided to embrace the hammer and sickle and seize the means of production?"
27454,Were you any good in high school or was it just fun?
27455,Oh okay well that sounds nice. I haven't played much tennis but I miss having more free time to do similar hobbies.
27456,Awesome! What breed is your dog?
27457,How sweet. I might get one myself then.
27458,"Hey now, you're an all star! Did you know they wrote that song with the hopes of giving their fans more confidence? "
27459,"Yeah, they're a great group. Very fun and uplifting."
27460,How fun! I remember the good old days with those games you didn't need a monthly subscription to
27461,"Yeah they're all pay to play, I think you should be able to play the whole game the first time you buy it..."
27462,Why don't you change your provider?
27463,Why you don't have a choice?
27464,That must be annoying.
27465,You should call the police on him.
27466,"Well, they deserve it. Medical school is not easy and they spent unimaginable effort and hard work to finish it"
27467,I truly respect and admire those people. They are the most beneficial members of the society
27468,"Well maybe he trusted you as a good friend, next time try to help him with his homework instead"
27469,"Oh yeah, that's not great. Next time make sure to say no directly to his face"
27470,I am sure you will! Did you make sure you took time working on it?
27471,Then I know you will do great! Good luck!
27472,I love boots fall is best for fashion
27473,now you have me excited too
27474,Is she still single? Some people don't like to be in a relationship
27475,"Hahaha, well she found the ""one"" I guess"
27476,"Yikes, that sounds horrifying"
27477,I would be grossed out too
27478,You are lucky to have that in your community.
27479,It is good that you care about that too.
27480,"Thats the worst part, I just finished one aswell, ended up doing pretty well."
27481,"yep, its the not knowing that gets to you most."
27482,Uh oh. I am sorry. What happened?
27483,I am sorry. At least you tried.
27484,Do you have a pet
27485,Did you gave any pet name to your cat
27486,Oh yeah me too. They can be so rude. 
27487,You are right. Some people should never drive a car again!
27488,I understand that feeling sometimes.
27489,You can tell me anything.
27490,whys that?? were they growing out of them/
27491,"wow, thats slightly harsh, but they have to learn some way."
27492,I like that too
27493,I wants had a smoothie that was terrible there
27494,What a wonderful time for your family! Is it a boy or girl?
27495,Oh fun! A little girl will be a great addition to the family
27496,But america is so great now! look at all the great things that are happening and are great
27497,"No, he truly is lower than a dog himself"
27498,Really??? A power out does not sound that scary
27499,"Now, that is scary!! Without power for days would be a nightmare "
27500,Why and what's HOA?
27501,The thing I don't like is that the HOA monitors that type of stuff.
27502,Did you get really wet? I hope you didn't catch a cold
27503,"Oh well I'm sure they didn't judge you, it could happen to anyone"
27504,I think we all did lol
27505,that had to be a long time ago
27506,yeah may be kids changed nowadays!!
27507,then you should instigate something in school!!
27508,Do you like old western movies
27509,"That's ok, I did not know much about it"
27510,"Ah, new version of Tom and Jerry. You would  be thinking whether to get or not!!"
27511,You should then wait for it. Not sure how much time it will take though!!
27512,"I hope so too, what kind of operation is it?"
27513,"I don't believe in god, but I hope you have a good doctor"
27514,"Oh that's so sad, how often do you get to visit them?"
27515,"Maybe video chat them a bit more, talk to them daily to let them feel your presence"
27516,That's great. I should visit you once for your great Pasta!!
27517,you are so skillful!! you should start your own brand!!
27518,Who is the singer?
27519,I am a huge fan of hers too!
27520,"Fun, did you play with your siblings?"
27521,"Ahh, I don't have any siblings but I bet it was a great time"
27522,"Oh man, that's so disappointing when they do that. Starts off the whole day wrong."
27523,Yeah small hint of peace in the morning before your hectic work day starts and all those meetings.
27524,I know what you mean. I feel the same sometimes but honestly it's not realistoc
27525,That is true. They probably look way different in person
27526,How come? Do you not trust him?
27527,"Oh don't think like that, it will only make things worse. Just be supportive and focus on yourself"
27528,Oh I bet! Did you just go on vacation? 
27529,Wow so happy for you. I have always wanted to go myself.
27530,"Oh no, that is terrible."
27531,I'm sorry that happened to you.
27532,"Fun, what concert is it?"
27533,Whoop! it's gonna be a fun time!
27534,Wow! Did you confront her about it?
27535,What a horrible thing to witness
27536,Yay! where are you going? are you excited?
27537,"wow, you are so lucky, I love the beach"
27538,"Aw, that's a shame. Is he a house dog or an outside one?"
27539,I would be as well. I would just keep a close eye on him whenever you can. Be his eyes.
27540,"Oh well you can celebrate it a couple days late, it's fine"
27541,"Don't worry, just appreciate him everyday"
27542,awwww..its tough leaving lifelong family pets
27543,i dont blame you. i moved out at 17 and i couldnt ever move back..
27544,I hope you pass! You tried your best
27545,You should celebrate when you hear back!
27546,"I have done that way too many times,  maybe use the air drter in the bathroom?"
27547,thats hilarious and terrible at the same time.
27548,Do you just walk alone usually?
27549,"Maybe you can invite someone every now and then, like a neighbor or someone you trust."
27550,She sounds like a good person.
27551,You also sound like a good person.
27552,did you do good? or get smacked around alot?
27553,Thats right! they didnt wanna to see the slaughter anymore.
27554,How sweet. What breed is the dog?
27555,Oh ok. That is so nice of y'all. That does not happen often enough.
27556,Really? Why do you do that?
27557,Yeah I understand that. I hope you feel better!
27558,"Me too, I am very lucky to have moved. I used to live in a place with a lot of earthquakes and hurricanes"
27559,"Yes, it's a traumatic experience to be in an earthquake"
27560,That is a good way to think.
27561,I like your positive attitude!
27562,Where did you go? did you enjoy yourself?
27563,why?? its good time to think
27564,Oh I am sorry to hear that. You will get another chance I am sure
27565,Don't feel too hard on yourself. I am sure you did your best.
27566,oh why not!! quality is better than quantity!!
27567,ah that is also there. You will make new friends!!
27568,"Oh no my dear, what happened to your leg?"
27569,Oh wow. Was it a bad car wreck?
27570,"Good for you. Socializing through such ways is a great way to enjoy your time. And besides, I am not Star Wars fan and have not watched any of the movie series"
27571,"Costume parties are very fun to attend. If i ever attend one, then i will go in iron man suit. I just love that character and its personality"
27572,It sounds like you are a loyal customer! How did you feel about them taking your headphone jack from their cellphones?
27573,"I suppose that's true, although I heard a lot of people were not happy with it."
27574,That sounds scary!
27575,Good thing you didn't get lost!
27576,"oh my god, just your luck huh,  thats crazy."
27577,"Me either, I have broken every phone ive owned!"
27578,WHAT HAPPENED?? DID YOU EVER GET IT BACK?!?
27579,did they have an explenation on what happened?
27580,How exciting! Hopefully it doesn't hurt too bad.
27581,Wow I bet you were surprised!
27582,"LOL a bat, how random"
27583,That's amazing! I love finding new places like that.
27584,I hope it does and you can KEEP going there! haha
27585,Did you cover it up or tell them about it?
27586,Now that is what I am talking about!
27587,Whoa! How are you feeling from it now?
27588,It's okay to give in to cravings every now and then.
27589,Wow you were able to do that?
27590,you should reduce the intake!!
27591,Whys that?! is it rotting out?
27592,"thats gross, go see the dentist please!"
27593,"Unfortunately, it happens to all of us."
27594,You will if you believe you can!
27595,What did you order?! was it delicious?
27596,"thats awesome, I love applbees, I like to drink there alot"
27597,True friends can be tested at such situations. Good for you to have such friends. It is very rare to have such ones
27598,I have only 2-3 close friends with whom I closely associate. I think that is the ideal number one should have
27599,"I agreee, and I see no point in it, This is all our country we are all one here, why fight."
27600,"very bleak, maybe we will have some sort of saving grace candidate."
27601,"I could imagine, we have a whole mountain of it around my apartment building just randomly lying around."
27602,Exactly! I'd like to pick it up with a scooper and throw it in their faces.
27603,oh my god! did you confront him about it?
27604,"Perfect, make him think you dont know, or dont know everything."
27605,OMG I'd be so upset. Did you confront him about it?
27606,I wish you all the luck!
27607,Oh no! Did they even leave a note of any kind?
27608,"I'd be livid! Some people just won't let us have nice things, I swear."
27609,"that sounds great, I hope you get it!"
27610,I'm always nervous at job interviews!
27611,"oh no, were you able to calm him down?"
27612,i'm glad he was able to get some relief from that storm anxiety 
27613,i am sorry to hear that. was it a clean break?
27614,i can understand that. it is hard at first but then it gets better. 
27615,I'm very sorry for your loss.
27616,I hope you will be at peace soon.
27617,Oh no! What was he accused of?
27618,Well maybe this will teach him a lesson and he'll come out of prison a new man.
27619,"uh oh, is everything okay? are you nervous? "
27620,"thats true, its always good to get testing and precautionary procedures. "
27621,"darn, Have you been working towards one lately?"
27622,have you been passed over it before?
27623,Really! I bet he was a real manly man then!
27624,It's always nice to have someone show you things. You're very lucky.
27625,"That sounds great, were you nervous about the interview?"
27626,That's good. Dogs are the best but an obedient dog is even better!
27627,I can't wait to have a dog. Maybe when my daughter is older..
27628,"oh that much, Will you be able to do it?"
27629,that's the confidence. I am sure you will do it
27630,I'm glad that you care about others.
27631,"LOL!! im sorry about that,  did you get him back?"
27632,"hahaha, thats true, thats not the worst outcome"
27633,oh man!! i hope you are ok. please tell me someone recorded it
27634,that sounds like a crazy day
27635,Eek! Hopefully your keyboard isn't acting up!
27636,That's a good idea! Or use a vacuum if you can.
27637,better be careful! the weather has been bad here lately too.
27638,nothing worse than being unprepared for a disaster 
27639,"Oh, what job is it?"
27640,"Wow, that is very high position!"
27641,"oh my god, thats alot of ham, Did he throw it up after?"
27642,"Thats a real eater right there, big belly."
27643,"Aww, I can remember the first time my son said daddy. I thought my heart was going to explode."
27644,It really is. kids can sure bring a wave of emotions upon us.
27645,That's amazing! You must be so happy
27646,Hard work pays off
27647,"I do that all the time lol hey, if it's in there it's up for grabs!"
27648,He should have eaten it sooner!
27649,yes there have been.i live in south texas and they are bad here
27650,yeah those do help.set up a perimiter
27651,I'm sure you'll make new friends really soon. 
27652,That's a great idea! Maybe go to the park too and meet people there.
27653,Oh how horrible. I'm sorry sorry to hear that.
27654,Aww I hope so too. Dogs are precious and they aren't here long. We have to be happy for our time with them no matter what.
27655,"I'm sure you did amazing, did you study hard for it?"
27656,When will you find out your scores?
27657,That would be great! It would certainly save you from having to buy a new car for a while.
27658,What kind of car can you win?
27659,"yea  have a cat, i like him"
27660,"That sucks, I hate when that happens!"
27661,Did you return the favor at all so to speak?
27662,That's good! Have  you met in person?
27663,Totally understandable... I'd be a bit apprehensive too
27664,Really! That's awesome! Was there something new in it you don't usually use?
27665,I think lasagna is one of my favorite things to make
27666,It can be a fun thing as long as one doesn't go overboard.
27667,"Yeah, I have had some legendary hangovers. I try to moderate better these days haha."
27668,That sounds really relaxing and nice.
27669,Well hopefully it doesn't rain or anything.
27670,"its understandable, they are so annoying"
27671,yea i hate it
27672,oh no im sorry to hear that
27673,it'll get better in time
27674,thats insane stuff
27675,"man thats really disheartening, you should type faster  tho"
27676,That's great! Wheer are you gonna go?
27677,That's a fun place to go. You'll have to be sure to take lots of pics!
27678,You can't believe they did it without asking or that the car needed the repairs?
27679,Wow I hope everything works out for you!
27680,"Wow, that's crazy. Is it very cold where you are living?"
27681,Interesting you say that. Here it's warm as well and we had a big rain storm and got some large hail as well!
27682,thats quite nice of them
27683,yea i bet that feels good
27684,Oh no! Hope your cat is feeling okay.
27685,"That's the thing about pets, hard to stay mad at them!"
27686,That's so impressive!
27687,"Hopefully, she seems really smart."
27688,that must be so hard to deal with 
27689,He seems to be on the right path now then
27690,Wow did anyone let you at least know?
27691,"Wow that is super unlucky, did she notice at all?"
27692,thats really annoying to deal with
27693,still tho thats dangerous
27694,im sorry to hear that. loss of a pet is tough
27695,are you planning on getting another pet?
27696,How long do you have to wait?
27697,Good luck! I'm sure you did great.
27698,"Oh wow, how long has it been since you got last promoted?"
27699,Well I hope you get it!
27700,Are you prepared for it? Did you study?
27701,I know what you mean. I think you'll do great though.
27702,sounds quite hard to deal with but good luck
27703,yea i would be too
27704,I definitely understand that feeling.  It took me forever to sign up for my Speech Communications class because of speaking in public.
27705,I actually took it late evening class without too many students and even was scared and only had to speak in front of the professor.
27706,"That's fair, having a father figure be present is really important."
27707,I hate shark movies too. That's why I refuse to swim in the ocean.
27708,The only way I'll get in is if I'm too drunk to care if I get eaten lol
27709,Congratulations! That is great news to hear!
27710,Yes! It is always good to have a positive attitude.
27711,Life can have some sudden turns. But these are very little chances to count on and hope for
27712,Good for him. But do not count on such things happening in life. They are very rare unless you put hard work to get them
27713,"That sucks, hopefully you can come back from that"
27714,That is usually pretty unlikely but I'm rooting for you.
27715,"That sounds nice, how long has it been?"
27716,"Indeed, enjoy your time away!"
27717,What kind of games?
27718,Oh I enjoyed board games when I was little too
27719,oof sounds so bad
27720,"Oh no, that must have been embarrassing! "
27721,Did anyone see it happen?
27722,"Wow, that must've been really scary!"
27723,I'm sure I would've been shaking as well!
27724,What do you mean exactly? She doesn't have the same passion when speaking to you?
27725,"Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. That must hurt."
27726,wow. are you ok? that can be really unnerving 
27727,i would be to. people need to be more aware on the road
27728,thats very cute to do that
27729,yea i bet it does
27730,I love watching heavy storms with thunder and lightening!
27731,"Yeah, as long as it is loud but not too close I usually love it!"
27732,"That sounds terrible, I hate losing a pet..."
27733,Did you end up getting another ever?
27734,That's great! It's such a good feeling working with people you actually like..
27735,I hope you have more nights like it!
27736,That's great! What are some things you're enjoying about life right now?
27737,"Oh man, having weekends off is such a deal breaker for me too. "
27738,"Kids are sweet. They will do everything to get what they want. So, did her mom made him Kraft Dinner eventually?"
27739,Don't be upset about it. Kids do not yet have conscious ability to think concretely in terms of other's feelings
27740,That's very nice of you. I hope she gets the issues sorted out!
27741,"Yes, I can imagine it must be hard for you as well. I wish you guys all the best."
27742,that is terrible. nevermind being embarassed i would have been mad and hungry!! 
27743,i dont blame you
27744,That's a good sign you did great then@
27745,Good luck! I hope you get it.
27746,Oh no! I would have asked for the manager! What did you do?
27747,I can't imagine why that person would do that! So unreasonable.
27748,Was there any reason you couldn't go? Did they not invite you?
27749,That's wonderful! I hope you had or have a great time!
27750,That's so cool! I really wish I had a dog!
27751,I really like cats but I want a dog at some point.
27752,"Ugh, I hate when that happens. Do you think the cat ate something bad?"
27753,"I bet. Poor kitty, I hope he/she feels better soon."
27754,i bet it did i would be too
27755,"i bet it is, good luck with tha"
27756,Oh yeah I hate rats too actually.
27757,Oh wow that sounds so scary! I might have done the same actually!
27758,I am not a fan of snaked either.
27759,"I once was bitten by a snake, luckily it had no venom."
27760,Sorry to hear that. Must feel quite lonely for you.
27761,Luckily you can always contact your husband to see how he is doing and hear his voice.
27762,"Oh no, did you tell them?"
27763,"If it's not bad,, I wouldn't tell them"
27764,"haha, welcome to Tinder! It's the app of mixed signals. Did things work out finally?"
27765,"Yeah, usually you just move on. There are plenty more fish in the sea!"
27766,"I know what you mean, scary movies really terrify me!"
27767,That's always a great way to make me feel more at ease!
27768,"Same here, who accused you?"
27769,Frick isn't a curse word.
27770,Same here! What makes you nervous>
27771,Yeah that's the same reason as me.
27772,that is bad news. my mother is going through the same thing unfortunately. landlord became widowd and now is moving with her daughter in anothe state so will be selling the house
27773,that is tough. my mothere also has her little dog. but more than likely she will move in with my family
27774,"Double the fun, are these your first children?"
27775,"Congrats, you should try to sleep some thou."
27776,You sound very confident! how will you make that happen?
27777,great! I wish i could find a profitable business.  i don't like worker for other people.
27778,I have not seen those but that sounds cute. Are you married?
27779,Yep there's nothing wrong with either of those things!
27780,I hate those kind of storms for good reasons.  We have lightning storms all the time in Georgia.  The power is more than likely to go out.
27781,"Yes indeed,  I've had to deal without power for 48 hours the last bad storm.  Almost three years ago, I was actually struck by lightning while in my home. "
27782,"thats so cool, nice job of him'"
27783,thats great good for you.
27784,Oh that's great news!
27785,You are a good friend I think
27786,Really? That's insane!
27787,"Cool, that sounds like a great weekend!"
27788,I do not like Tinder. What did she do?
27789,"That is too bad, don't give up hope thou."
27790,Oh that is pretty terrifying! What caused it?
27791,Oh that's a relief though!
27792,That could have been a scary situation. How was the party?
27793,That's good. I guess you never know what to expect sometimes.
27794,"I love Disney World, who are you going with?"
27795,Hopefully you have enough time to see all the parks.
27796,Oh no! Don't blame yourself. It happens
27797,Better luck next time!
27798,thats a fair point
27799,yea i bet it is
27800,"That's great, how did it go?"
27801,Yep that's the way to do it!
27802,that would be cool. do you have singing experience ?
27803,"so am i .im a guitar player, not a singer"
27804,Did you figure out a way to pay it thou?
27805,That was very nice of her.
27806,"Aw that's the worst, especially when the clothes are new!"
27807,That's pretty annoying that nobody told you!
27808,"Wow, that's good for him. What do you think changed for him?"
27809,That's cool! It's always good to hear when people decide to take a good step forward.
27810,Are you happy for him?
27811,Do you have a girlfriend?
27812,I've never even heard of that before!
27813,Oh cool! Sounds like fun!
27814,why do you say that? are you worried about the current state of affairs?
27815,He may not.  He has certainly made a few enemies.
27816,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that about your grandmother.  I'm close to my grandmother so I would definitely need for the doctors to provide the best of care.  I'm sure you are looking for a speedy recovery."
27817,That's a great position to take especially when something like this occur.  It puts so many things in perspective on what's important.  I'm glad you have good doctors so you can focus on just being there for her.
27818,Oh no! I always like to pick out what I'm wearing the night before. Maybe that would help?
27819,It really could help. I heard Einstein used to wear the same clothes everyday because it would help him stay focused on his studies! 
27820,eh its worth it tho
27821,still worth it imo
27822,"That was nice of them, did you pay them?"
27823,"That was nice, you should help them next time."
27824,What did you get him?
27825,Does he grill a lot?
27826,Oh so it was your work? That's understandable then.
27827,Wow that doesn't sound like a very good relationship. Did you talk to her about it?
27828,Wow I'm sorry I hope you can figure something out!
27829,"Good for you. I had couple of interviews couple of years ago. Was very nervous, but thankfully they all went well. My advice, just try to hide your nervousness and show confidence"
27830,So when are you expected to hear back for final decision on your hire?
27831,thats understabled i get it
27832,i get what you meam
27833,what?!?! how? what happend if you dont mind me asking
27834,wow. glad to hear you are ok
27835,Oh no! Did she move away from your city?
27836,Well hopefully you feel better about the situation. It will hurt for awhile.
27837,You must of been so proud of him.
27838,Will he be going to college?
27839,Did you get the B?
27840,"That is great news, good job."
27841,Oh that sucks. What role were you applying for?
27842,"Cool, sorry to hear that you didn't get it."
27843,How did he do that?
27844,"That is great, do you ever help him study?"
27845,I'm not that into sports. What do you like about them?
27846,"That's fair, good for them then!"
27847,Aww.. I am so sorry for your loss. It is so hard to lose our loved ones. 
27848,It sometimes helps to remember the good times you had together.  
27849,"Geez, hopefully they get caught someday for driving so reckless. Good to hear you are okay."
27850,thats smart of you
27851,i would always do that
27852,"That sounds great, it's always nice to have a new place to play like that!"
27853,Glad you have a place like it to enjoy
27854,How long dd you do that for?
27855,The cat must of got tired.
27856,That was brave of you to talk to her.
27857,That's always a good idea. I respect that.
27858,That's a good way to be a parent. They will grow up to be more honest and respectable.
27859,How long has he been in the Navy?  I have a bonus son (my son's best friend) who has been in the Navy for about a year now.
27860,"That's a nice commitment.  My father is an Air Force veteran.  I'm not too fond of the military, but it definitely makes a difference in the lives of many."
27861,"Yes, I love 80s rock n roll."
27862,"Yes, I wish I could go back in a time machine."
27863,"Ugh, tell me about it. Her and Trump both make me feel that way."
27864,"He doesn't really say anything of substance in my opinion. Just vague words. But hey, to each his own!"
27865,Does she come over every day?
27866,Maybe you should cook for her one night.
27867,I am sure a B or A- is just as good.  Which class was it?
27868,"Ohhh that's a hard subject. I struggled with physics a lot, but not as much as chemistry."
27869,That's so lucky! How much did you win?
27870,"That's a good amount, cool!"
27871,Are you going to see her again?
27872,I thought you hit it off thou?
27873,wow i would be so sad if i saw that
27874,yea i would die if i saw that
27875,"Oh god, what happened?"
27876,I'm glad you are okay. That sounds terrifying!
27877,"Congratulations. That is very good luck you had. To be honest, i am not really interested in those scratch tickets as i think they are just waste of my hard earned money"
27878,Good. But my advice to you is do not count on them too much as they have astronomically low chances of winning even anything at all
27879,"Holy cow, that's a large limit! And I thought my $2500 limit was decent!"
27880,Just be careful and don't get too excited and start swiping it all over!
27881,"Wow, that's pretty impressive! Have you been training a lot?"
27882,That's awesome to have that type of dedication.
27883,When is her birthday?
27884,Where will you have the party?
27885,Where did he meet her?
27886,"Not when, where I asked?"
27887,I hope so too! So are you a teacher or substitute or what?
27888,What kind of math do you teach?
27889,What did you steal from him?
27890,Why don't you return it?
27891,"Same, especially being as attractive as he is."
27892,He pretty much has everything at this point.
27893,Where and when did this happen?  I haven't looked at the news lately to avoid hearing sad news.  The last incident of the duck boat accident was very saddening.
27894,Oh wow.  I will definitely need to look at that.  Was there many casualties?
27895,I think kids should all be home schooled.
27896,They can hire teachers to come to the house.
27897,I love tacos! Do they serve other mexican food?
27898,Sounds delish! I really like Moes southwest grill. If you get the chance you should try it.
27899,"Sorry to hear that, will you get another dog?"
27900,Do you have any other pets?
27901,That's non fun. I'm sorry to heard that. Maybe you shouldn't go there anymore?
27902,The food is not very healthy so you are not missing much
27903,thats no fun! i love to swim and be in the pool or beach. but i work too much to go
27904,yes you should. its not hard!
27905,"I love cruises, where is your cruise headed?"
27906,Have you ever been there before?
27907,Sorry to hear that. It's tough when unexpected things like that happen.
27908,"Man, the tax system needs a complete overhaul. Hope things work out for you in the future."
27909,Did you tell him you wanted it?
27910,Will he buy you a cake when you shop next time?
27911,You sound very confident! What sport do you play?
27912,"That sounds fun! I like boats, but I don't think I would be a good rower."
27913,What plane crash are you referring to?
27914,I never heard about it. I'm glad nobody died though!
27915,Why don't you do the same thing?
27916,All you can do is keep working hard.
27917,Happy Birthday to You!  I love birthdays so much.  Just recently celebrated by youngest daughter's 14th birthday on August 9th and my granddaughter's 4th birthday on August 10th.  When is/was your birthday?
27918,My daughter just had a nice birthday dinner with family.  My granddaughter had a couple of parties. What kind of party do you plan on having?
27919,Won't you enjoy less chaos?
27920,The kids can always visit you.
27921,Have you ever talked on the phone at movies yourself?
27922,Well Its always fun to get the people on their phones thrown out of the movie theater
27923,That's awful! What kind of car do you have?
27924,Those are good cars.  I have a volkswagen beetle and I love it!
27925,"Make a pizza, it is a fail safe choice."
27926,"Yes, pizza with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar dipping. "
27927,Did you get hurt or just your car?
27928,I hope they caught the guy.
27929,I hope it's not Game of Thorns??
27930,"I need to look it up, never heard of it."
27931,"That is a well trained dog, how did you get it to respond like that.?"
27932,"My dog is the worst, Always crys, he is pretty young. But I wish he was like your dog."
27933,"Uh oh, that sounds bad.  Is it your wife?"
27934,Do you know who it is?
27935,those are always good memories
27936,i agree. no one can ever take those from us
27937,Aw that sounds sweet. You're wonderful for doing that and I'm sure you can't wait to get there!
27938,I hope everything goes well for you!
27939,"what kind, is she alive?"
27940,"Too bad, is you window broken now?"
27941,Did you threw it back into his car?
27942,"Unfortunately there are people like that in this world, but maybe they can change someday."
27943,were you happy to see him after that long time?
27944,"seeing the people you love in real life feels always different, i'm glad you were happy!"
27945,"Yes, I think people that work these jobs should call in sick when they are not in a mood."
27946,"Same here, CS is just as important as the products we buy."
27947,Did you end up reading any reviews on it first?
27948,Well you should take a leap of faith and go in with an open mind.
27949,"Great, for what store?"
27950,It's rare this days for people to hand make gifts or anything.
27951,Why didn't you ?
27952,Did they get mad at you?
27953,were you shocked it happened so fast?
27954,best to block her in every way so you don't hear about her life
27955,What happend? Do you have test results pending?
27956,Well what you should do first is be with your family and those who care about you.
27957,"Cool, where did you go?"
27958,This is a trail where you can walk for months?
27959,I love coming home too. 
27960,I just love relaxing here. My favourite thing is no neighbours !
27961,really? what was it about?
27962,that sounds so interesting!
27963,Is this your first time?  I know that is something that I would even ever consider.  My fear of heights would render me completely lifeless.  So are you doing the real skydiving or in one of these indoor skydiving places?
27964,"Well, I am working my way up to taking a flight across the oceans perhaps one where I'm in a plane in the sky for over 8 hours.  Outside of that, I will give it to you that you are really brave."
27965,If your son is very young and you give him an allowance then tie it to that!
27966,Haha sadly it does not. I still hold off on doing it in my own apartment at 26. Unless they are very young I don't think here really is a good way unless it smells
27967,how what made you feel? do tell
27968,wow!! that sounds horrible! i cant believe she even tried to get your number! did you give it to her? hahah
27969,"man what happened next, i would have been looking for a place to hide"
27970,I bet that was a relief and pretty funny when you look back on it.
27971,That sounds like your job is going well.
27972,I bet you feel really respected and welcome there.
27973,"That's great for your sister, but you must have felt left out."
27974,Did she invite you another year?
27975,Did you have fun when you got to go?
27976,I guess learning to appreciate positives and get past negatives is part of life :)
27977,What instrument do they yplay?
27978,Oh that's great! You must be very proud.
27979,do you have all your gear ready to go ?
27980,"that sounds fun but dangerous at the same time, is it ?"
27981,Oh no! You must have been pretty frustrated.
27982,That's great that you had someone to help you.
27983,Oh yeah? Are you excited?
27984,That's great. I hope you have a wonderful time.
27985,"Oh no, i bet that is frustrating. Have you ever used him before?"
27986,I cant stand noisy pipes. I hope he is able to fix it for you. 
27987,"That's a bummer. Sorry to hear that but I am sure you can reschedule, right?"
27988,I would be to if I were in your shoes.  I would be very disappointed too.
27989,"Awesome, I love pasta. "
27990,"Lol that sounds wild, did you text them something appropriate?"
27991,"Hopefully he can take constructive criticism, I think more people should be open to that."
27992,That's the worst! What did you do?
27993,Saved you the money from having to call pop a lock.
27994,Awww how sweet. is he your only child? It does get easier....
27995,I felt the same way when my youngest started school. They grow up so fast. 
27996,"I just cannot understand why people won't do their job properly, I had to cut my lunch break in order to do more work"
27997,"That is so sad, they don't seem to understand workers."
27998,That is nice from you. What card is it?
27999,"Oh wow, that sounds unfortunate. Is there no way to ask the neighbor to take it easy?"
28000,That sounds terrible. I hate to hear single mothers dealing with extra problems like these. If anything I would advise your son to be careful and defend himself.
28001,"Aw, good on her. I bet she knew exactly how it would make you feel, too. Things people do personally themselves always have the better result."
28002,"Now it's your turn! Surprise her with something that will remind her of something special too. People hate to hear it, but our parents are only with us for so long, and when they're gone we have so many regrets. Use that as a motivator"
28003,"I know that feeling, so frustrating!  Do you think there's a chance the person will change?"
28004,"I'm sorry!  Maybe you could try distancing yourself from this person, you have to protect yourself first."
28005,Oh god..They do that to me TOO! And we have poison water! Are they going to fix it?
28006,Oh..the phone part is the worst! And being transferred and re-telling the story! I am glad they reversed it though! Most companies won't!
28007,I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan to change things?
28008,"That's terrible, but good for you for having a plan. You'll get through it, your happiness is the most important thing!"
28009,Oh that is nice! Why did they move back?
28010,Oh fantastic! I am sure they are happy to be home.
28011,That happens sometimes but I'm sure you will make a lot of new friends in your new job.
28012,"That is good, maybe you can still hang out with them outside of work."
28013,Could it be fixed at all? 
28014,I am sorry to hear that but luckily noone got hurt.
28015,Good friends are invalueble.
28016,I know how you feel... people also get married and have kids.
28017,Was it a slow leak or was it somethign else?
28018,As long as you have an easy way to fill it up.
28019,"That's great news! I find most people are good, honest folk. It's the few rotten ones that make us forget that."
28020,"That's so nice of you. As I said, most people are very nice. You at least now have peace of mind."
28021,"Wow, Did you see a doctor?"
28022,That is good.
28023,Do you expect it to be positive?
28024,"If your review is good, could you get a bonus?"
28025,"That is good, are you going to have a nap?"
28026,What do you do to relax?
28027,That's great. Do you get a bonus?
28028,That's great. What do you sell?
28029,That must be such a relief to get another semester behind you. It's hard waiting to get your grades though I'm sure.
28030,Best wishes to you on your upcoming courses. I have a feeling you will be very successful.
28031,"Well, it is good you have a friend that is so close to you that you feel comfortable sharing with them. "
28032,"Trust is a hard thing to find, I am so glad you found this bond with this person."
28033,That's so annoying. Maybe you should leave earlier next time too.
28034,oh
28035,About what/
28036,I am not really a football fan but it is fun to be a part of something!
28037,Really?  What did they do to impress you so much?
28038,Wow!  That sounds amazing and complicated!  Now I understand why you were positively surprised!
28039,That is great. Did you watch all Harry Potter movies?
28040,I like also a lot Harry Potter movies.
28041,did it bring a lot of memories?
28042,yeah there's nothing like the good old days
28043,"Well, that wasn't a very nice thing to do! Think of it as getting a new beard, rather than losing the old friend."
28044,I don't think you're overreacting. That is something important to you and they should have realized that. Maybe it's time for new friends?
28045,"Yeah, I have a few ""friends"" like that. We hang out now and again, but there are others I'd rather spend my time with."
28046,That's nice of her.  What was the occasion?
28047,"Ha that's nice of her! Well if you haven't had your wedding yet, I hope it turns out super nice!"
28048,That must be stressful to your friend.
28049,That's good that you are content with what you have. 
28050,Omg that must have been really embarrassing. Did anyone came to your rescue?
28051,Haha. I can just imagine you running away. 
28052,Oh that is so nice! Was it a special occassion?
28053,That's lovely. I love when people just give small gifts to each other for no reason.
28054,Hows that working out for you.
28055,I once lost a wallet with a heavy sume of ash in it and I tried to have faith tht I would find it or some I trusted would find it and return it back to me.
28056,"Yes, you were just mentioning it. What happened?"
28057,Did you have your wallet returned to you? If it's your relative I think that everything should work out for good.
28058,Oh that is so wonderful! How old is he?
28059,That's so sweet. 
28060,That was nice of you. What kind of soup.
28061,That sounds really good!
28062,Where did he go? Is he calling you?
28063,That's annoying. Have you talked to your boss about it?
28064,That can be tough. Hopefully she'll understand.
28065,Oh that is great! I have had great success doing keto and fasting for not feeling so hungry! Carbs and sugar do me in! What kind of lunches do you make?
28066,"true! I don't mind the same things. You can do healthy, it just takes more prep and ingredients sometimes to do it tasty and healthy"
28067,That's horrible! What happened to you? Who stabbed you in the back?
28068,"That's really difficult to deal with. When you love someone, you lower your guard for that person and more than anyone else they're the ones that can hurt you the most. I hope you find a resolution to your problem."
28069,"That sounds interesting, I would love to get a piercing. Where will you be getting the piercing?"
28070,"Darn it! I have never seen that before, now I am would like to see what it looks like"
28071,Oh no! I would be so angry! 
28072,That's so wrong. Id speak to a supervisor
28073,"Wow, I bet he was really surprised he got to meet him. What did he think of him in person?"
28074,That's great. It's good to see celebreties be the same in real life as they are on the internet or TV.
28075,"Oh god, I hate flying. I always seem to get the plane that ends up having some issue."
28076,"Yeah, I will drive almost anywhere rather than fly if I can."
28077,"Haha.. I'm sorry, that made me laugh a little bit. I do that sometimes too, and have no idea how I can forget so many times. I think at least if it happens, almost no one can really tell or notice, if that helps."
28078,"Well, you could have been going commando, too. And shame on them for not letting you know. Let's focus on the positives--you can pull off skinny jeans, and you're interesting enough to want to wear Superman underwear. Keep it up"
28079,Did the company not pay you well enough?
28080,"Well, that was a long time ago, I don't think you need to carry it around with you anymore, unless you're still doing it."
28081,Gross. What did you do?
28082,i think you could have removed them and still ate it. isnt that normal for them to have bugs in them sometimes?
28083,That is amazing! I bet she had to work hard for that.
28084,That's great. I think education is more important than ever
28085,"I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully she naturally mellows out."
28086,"Wow, that doesn't sound good. Situations like this are hard because you probably don't want to offend your family and stuff."
28087,How exciting!  I remember when my girls said their first words!  What was his first word do you know?
28088,"Yeah, that seems to be what a lot of little ones say for their first word.  Something about it being easier than ma ma - congrats to the little tyke!"
28089,"wow, good for her! I'm sure she worked really hard to get a degree"
28090,i'm sure she will be able to find a really great job now !
28091,I am so sorry that you have to go through that on your day off. Just try to be nice to her.
28092,Maybe you need to go to the store and bring her flowers and chocolate
28093,I don't envy you there. I have done the blind family meeting at a holiday dinner before. It's nerve racking. 
28094,"Well, my advice is to give in now, because you probably will in the end anyway and avoid any extra arguing you two would do because of it."
28095,"Oh no, I am so sorry you have to leave your furbaby! Give her lots of extra snuggles and explain to her that you will be back and I am sure she will be delighted to see you upon your return!! Have you ever left her before?"
28096,"I believe dogs can understand what you tell them, they understand if we say treat or ride after all lol. Maybe you could send a small blanket that smells like you or an old tshirt you have worn to bed. That may help her to feel more comfortable!"
28097,That's awesome!  Does he have any plans for what he's doing after high school?
28098,That's great to hear!  Good luck to him!
28099,Awesome! What does his new house look like?
28100,Oh a pool! Inground or above ground?
28101,Why did they left half of the trash?
28102,Did you complain to municipality?
28103,"That's awful, what was he yelling at you about?"
28104,"LOL.  Yeah, been there. Even when those guys do that and are wrong they typically never apologise. They just pretend like they weren't acting like a jerk."
28105,AHHHHHHHHHH!  That is amazing.  I am so jealous of you.  Where are you going?
28106,Where is that?
28107,Have fun!  I'm sure you will.
28108,Ah thats so bad. why not raise a complaint
28109,Hope it get resolved soon
28110,Oh no! Do they have. alost and found?
28111,I hope you can figure it out soon!
28112,Oh nice.  Is he the type to tone himself down in social settings...but he's secretly a wiz kid
28113,Well gotta watch out for him...it's the quiet unassuming ones that are usually full of surprises
28114,I call them hypocrites. They take advantage of people whenever it suites their needs. Can't stand the presence of such people
28115,I knew a couple of people whom I suspected of fitting the description we talked here. And I tried to stay away from them as much as i could
28116,"I love dogs, and have three myself. What type of breed is the puppy?"
28117,"I have two wiener dogs, and they are both spoiled brats, but I love them. You should be very happy with your girlfriend's choice of gifts."
28118,Oh no!  What happened?  Do you think you did ok anyway?
28119,"That's sad to hear :(  That happened to me before and I came out ok in the end, I'm sure you will too :)"
28120,"I know how you feel, my brother is my best friend but I only talk to him about once a month because he is so busy.  Where is your brother now?"
28121,"Well, I hope you get to talk to him more and maybe can get over there for a visit!"
28122,Oh no! Did it leave a dent?
28123,I know how you feel. If I had an accident like that I wouldnt be able to pay either.
28124,Nice! How'd you do
28125,That's pretty awesome.  How much richer are you now
28126,Did this happen recently?
28127,That is good that the person was courteous. That may not happen everytime
28128,"I'm sorry to hear that,  Was it his fault?"
28129,That's good to hear. How did the other person fare?
28130,Are you jealous by this or does it make you angry?
28131,Are you going to be able to purchase the truck for yourself anytime soon?
28132,True. Do you have any plans for the weekend? 
28133,That sounds fun. I love going to the lake its so relaxing. 
28134,That is awesome that you have such friendly coworkers!
28135,Make sure you give each of them a thank you card
28136,Did you find out what it was
28137,Haha that's pretty funny
28138,"I'm glad you're feeling well, it's always important to make your health a priority, without our health we have nothing!"
28139,"You sound very dedicated, that's great you're so focused on your health, you will age gracefully I'm sure!"
28140,That's disgusting. What kind of parent lets their child run around like that.
28141,"Yeah, really makes you want to touch anything in a store with booger hands wandering around putting his hands on everything."
28142,Sweet! Wouldn't mind one myself. What do they cost new?
28143,Woah! I could live for ten years on that. Hope you wrote down his tag - maybe you could sweet-talk him into going for a drive!
28144,That is really mean. I am sorry.
28145,That is so sad. Have you seen or heard from her again?
28146,Do you think she will keep you awake? How old is she?
28147,"Maybe you can hide some of your things, or put them in a safe place. "
28148,That is so amazing.  Animals have an amazing ability to find their way home.  I wonder if it was out there having a Homeward Bound style adventure.
28149,"That is so great, I'm glad you got your little friend back."
28150,Oh that would kill to see. Maybe he will hook you up.
28151,I would be very jealous. Dont let it get to you too much. At least it doesnt seem like you see him all that often.
28152,Thats awesome. Do you look like him?
28153,That is really nice to have found. I hope you hold onto them in a safe place.
28154,A little homesick?  Are you traveling for vacation or for work?
28155,I understand how you feel.  Maybe its time to change locations?
28156,"Oh my god, that is terrible. Has it affected you knowing you slept through that kind of event right next door?"
28157,I would have as well. I am sorry that happened to you and I hope you can learn to sleep peacefully again.
28158,"Yes, it's important to find somebody who you will be able to trust and also somebody who will love you for being you"
28159,that's great to hear! I hope you will meet your true love soon! I believe when you do you will now right away. When i met my husband i knew right away he is the one. such a strange feeling. But we've been married for 5 years now and still crazy about each other
28160,Oh no! Can you ask for an extension? Sometimes they'll be quite accommodating.
28161,That seems strange in this day and age. I thought everything could be done online. Perhaps you could hand deliver those parts.
28162,Good. Where are you going?
28163,I understand. Have a good trip. Are you traveling alone?
28164,Now that is something I would imagine is hard to deal with. I hope you are in a better place.
28165,You just have to keep working at it.
28166,"Oh that's terrible. I wouldn't shut it all out though, you could miss out on someone great."
28167,Yeah you are right. Better to take things slow and figure out what they are all about first.
28168,That's really kind of you. Not everyone can or will do that. I do hope she pays you back!
28169,"I'm sure! It's always nice to help someone in need, but you do hope they'll do the right thing by you when possible."
28170,You're obviously a very good person and I'm sure your friend knows that - she'll repay you when she can.
28171,Then you'll be fine :)
28172,"That's pretty heavy. I hope that doesn't discourage you from trying again in the future, especially with a rescue dog or something in that area. If you don't mind me asking, what happened?"
28173,"I had never heard of that before. That sounds like tragic timing. And you're right, I probably shouldn't have brought up getting another one so soon, it just sounded like you'd be a good owner, since you seem like you care so much. It makes sense for you to not rush right back into it."
28174,"That is so great that he was able to go.  I had the same problem as you, but I started at community college when I was 26 and finished at a 4 year college when I was 32.  It is never too late for you to go."
28175,"They are the best.  I think it is good to go later, because you know what you want more and don't waste time and money."
28176,Awesome. Is it the first ime?
28177,Maybe you will a friend soon. Or even meet a nice guy.
28178,That's horrible. Is it treatable?
28179,"I'm praying that she will be fully healed, and that you will take good care of her."
28180,"Everyone in life has problems, do not feel bad for sharing yours I hope it gets better for you."
28181,"You are welcome, I am glad I can put you in a better mood."
28182,That's fantastic! It must be a good day for you.
28183,I'm sure you were pretty nervous after you applied.
28184,A little anxious?  Have you ever flown on a plane before?
28185,I'm sure you'll be fine. Statistically its safer than driving.
28186,That sounds cool. Do you go fishing a lot?
28187,My dad really enjoyed fishing. I think I'd like the peace and quiet of it.
28188,How awesome! She must be proud of herself! Where does she work?
28189,It isn't easy to be successfully self-employed but she did it! 
28190,"That is awesome, how long have you been playing?"
28191,Have you thought about getting back into it?
28192,Awesome! Do you think did well?
28193,"Nice, what job did you apply for?"
28194,These people are not people you see everyday. I wouldnt worry about it
28195,Watch some youtube videos of other peoples misfortunes so you can forget about yours quickly!
28196,Why would anyone make a party in a shady area? Was it your friend's party?
28197,Probably it is just the theme of his party. He wanted to have some fun in the form of cautious excitement
28198,Awe. That is soo sweet. You have some really good friends
28199,That is really nice to have. Most people don't even have one good friend.
28200,"that is really such a pain, i remember when i had to do my paperwork for school it is not fum"
28201,well i really wish you very good luck with all that
28202,That is so nice what kind was it?
28203,That sounds so good I love coconut rum that would have made my birthday awesome I'm glad you enjoyed it. 
28204,I used to be that way too.  One thing to think about that might help is even if you do look stupid for a second nobody is going to remember 10 minutes from then.  Another thing that helped me was thinking about how good it felt if a stranger started talking with me in public for a 2-5 minute conversation and how it didnt upset me or make them look stupid so I shouldnt look stupid if I did the same thing.
28205,"Oh really, do you feel like you did a great job?"
28206,"Thats good, it must be relieving to feel so confident."
28207,oh yea.. whats that?
28208,Oh nice.  where can I find it?  Netflix?
28209,Did you do something to cause the breakup?
28210,Oh no! That's a lot of money. Did you get any of it back?
28211,"Doesn't give anyone the right to steal it, tho'. I'm so sorry - how awful for you. I hope they had a horrible time when they tried to spend it!"
28212,"Oh geez, stay safe!  Tornadoes are one of those weird things for me.  They sort of scare me but before they happen and its raining yet still outside I love going out to see whats happening."
28213,"hahaha, I dont know if people today would rather lose electricity or get a tornado.  Either way I hope you stay safe and if a tornado does come you dont take any damage!"
28214,It is important to have a focus on something positive.
28215,"Nothing in life is certain, the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you."
28216,"That must mean they think you're a pretty cool person! People usually don't go through that kind of effort unless they think you're worth it and deserve it. So, kudos to you for having that kind of effect on others!"
28217,"Oh, you don't work with them anymore? Or maybe it was because you decided to be a stay-at-home mother? "
28218,You may need to go to the barber shop!
28219,The barber shop is totally worth it. They do such a good job.
28220,That's terrible! I hope it didn't end up inside them?
28221,Okay well that's good at least. I hope you find it soon!
28222,"Well that was rude, did you confront him?"
28223,"I would ask him how it went and casually say ""I would have gone had you asked""."
28224,That's awesome!  You're really lucky.
28225,I'm sure it took a lot of hard work to get to that point!
28226,Oh man! That sucks! Did anyone happen to see it?
28227,I am sorry you have to deal with that. What a pain!
28228,Congratulations! That sounds like a lot of great news in one month!
28229,I really hope it does. Just stay positive!
28230,What did you find out??
28231,"Oh wow, are you excited?? I would assume so if you agreed to go on a date.  I hope you guys have a great time!"
28232,I'm so curious. What happened at church?
28233,"Oh little mistakes like that happen, it's no big deal!"
28234,You hate it when what happens?
28235,"Oh yeah, that it the worst. Were you able to wash it out at least?"
28236,I get really anxious too. What are you having surgery on?
28237,I've had that done before.  The waking up with gauze in your mouth is the worst part.
28238,did it bring back a lot of memories?
28239,yeah there's nothing like the good old days 
28240,Good for you.  How is it going?
28241,Pretty good here - just a homeschooling mom of 2 trying to get some laundry done.  I'm glad you are on the path you want to be on!
28242,Lol I love a good Jason Statham movie
28243,What made you blush so hard?
28244,Hey you have got to do what you have got to do. Hopefully next time you're closer to home when you need to go.
28245,Did you watch it late at night? I rarely watch scary movies.
28246,I dont blame you. You are going to have to watch them during the day next time.
28247,That sounds exciting!
28248,How old is your nephew?
28249,"Yeah, glasses suck but, so does not being able to see. Good that your class mates are nice people."
28250,"Yep, I've got terrible eyes. I know what you mean."
28251,"Oh well that would have been embarrassing, but if you were trying to shed a few pounds I would say your doing a great job! "
28252,Go buy you some new snazzy belts! Haha!
28253,Thats interesting!
28254,I know how you feel. What helped me was getting a bicycle and get out in the sun for some exercise.
28255,I feel you. Well it sounds like you keep yourself busy with a hobby at least. 
28256,That is really something to be thankful for. I have lost 2...So for sure!
28257,It's okay! Life happens! Cherish your babies always :)
28258,Where did you go shopping?
28259,I love the thrift stores. i can spend hours in there.
28260,"I buy a lot of kids clothes from there. I also go to a salvage store called Dirt cheap, great deals!"
28261,Sounds like a cool Goodwill.
28262,Do you feel like you are prepared?
28263,"Well make sure you get a good nights rest, sleep is just as important."
28264,wow thats horrible.  I hate the way they make the system to steal money
28265,"Maybe it might be worth trying again now, with another doctor?"
28266,I saw it when I was much older but my parents didn't let me watch it when I was young.  I bet.  That wouldn't be like real life for really being left home alone. 
28267,I forgot about that part!  Yes!  Terrifying!  Hope you didn't have too many nightmares over it.
28268,I didnt have an interview.  did you?
28269,I hope you get it too.  Goodluck
28270,Wow! Did she say yes?
28271,Sorry to hear that. Are you breaking up with her?
28272,"Oh no, I'm sorry.  What went badly?  One things or just lots of little things?"
28273,I completely get it.  Hope things are better tomorrow!
28274,Oh fantastic! What did you guys do?
28275,By her you mean wife?
28276,"That's so embarrassing, but hey everyone has those moments once in a while. "
28277,"Good idea! And if ever you go back, just take it slow and easy."
28278,"that's sad, bad memories ?"
28279,"yeah i understand you, but people change and we learn from them and that helps us grow more, don't take it too personally "
28280,Oh good luck man! Hopefully everything works out! 
28281,We can only hope so! Get her some flowers! 
28282,"Hm, thats not good. How so, if I may ask?"
28283,Sounds like quite a problem! I think you should try different foods and narrow down which ones trouble you.
28284,WHAT? Do live in california?
28285,That is so awful! Did you have insurance??
28286,He sounds like he got really lucky. I'd be pretty jealous of him if I were you.
28287,"Well, that's not a very friend like thing to do."
28288,"THAT'S AMAZING, what test was it?"
28289,"algebra? WOW i love maths, that sounds great i am so happy"
28290,"Oh no, what did you do?"
28291,"Oh no!  Does he know you did it or did you never tell him?  Yeah, we all have things we regret, its how we move forward and resolve the situation that matters."
28292,Wow that must of been such a great surprise.
28293,Dang he should clean my house too then while i am gone.
28294,No way! Congrats!!! I bet you feel really excited.  How long had you been developing it?
28295,"I bet, 4 years is a long time to work on a project too.  I may not know you but as someone who had once wanted to get into development, I feel really proud for you.  That is a huge accomplishment! Congrats again!"
28296,haha! I hear you! It helps if you have more money to save too!
28297,Lol! Well that would be great. Give me some of that luck! ;)
28298,Where are yours and what's going on withthem?
28299,So sorry to hear that...wish you blessings and health and peace
28300,that was so nice of her i bet you was so happy you much be very special to her
28301,one day i wanted a rabbit and my mom got me one she told me not to feed it food and i gave it house food and it die lol
28302,"I guess neither do I, sorry to hear about your rabbit though."
28303,"Yes its a good lesson for you, hopefully you dont repeat it!"
28304,Your a pretty tough guy and you have the wits too dude. You got this.
28305,Like i said you got this and going in with a positive mine you might as well take the world while your at it.
28306,"Aww, that's sweet. I love animals! They love you unconditionally."
28307,"Uh oh, someone's in trouble! It's funny how smart dogs can be sometimes. They were trying to butter you up before you saw what they did!"
28308,Oh no I hope you didn't spend much on it 
28309,That's such a shame! I always hate getting let down 
28310,Aw you must have felt really nostalgic in that moment. Sounds like a great memory.
28311,I would highly suggest you do. Moms deserve all the love.
28312,Ugh hate when that happens...do you live alone or with roommates
28313,Man I woulda smacked him on the head...lol rotting food/dirty dishes are the worst
28314,I hope it does.
28315,"wow, thats horrible. what were they stealing?"
28316,thats horrible.  im glad they got caught
28317,That's cool. Sounds like you're an animal person
28318,If you could..would you get a cat or a dog
28319,"I agree, but maybe you should be a little less aggressive "
28320,"I dont know, I just wouldnt be that aggressive. I'd still try to protect her though"
28321,"oh im sorry to hear that, what caused this?"
28322,"no one deserves this, this is the worst thing that can ever happen, im sorry to hear that "
28323,"That's fantastic, you must feel really confident in your ability."
28324,Do you receive feedback often?
28325,That must have been nostalgic. When did you last pick one up?
28326,"What a beautiful game, hey?"
28327,Oh no!  Was it expensive items?
28328,That is so awful.  I am so sad that happened to you.
28329,"Interesting! I could see how you thought that. Just because they're homeless and have fallen on hard times doesn't mean they're dumb. But yeah, there's a good chance they did something wrong to be in that predicament, so their judgment could be questionable. "
28330,"You're right, sorry for putting words in your mouth. And yeah, I don't know how to engage with them either. As a college student, there are plenty that kind of stalk the campus and ask for spare change. But I have little spending money, so I always have to turn them down"
28331,"Haha I""m terrible with names too.  But for me there are only 2 types of people: ones that are memorable and ones that are boring and if you're boring I definitely won't remember who the hell you are"
28332,That's good.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  People should be begging for your attention. Not the other way around ;)
28333,That is very lucky! Did you see who dropped it?
28334,Oh wow! Lucky you!
28335,Is everything going perfectly?
28336,I get that! What show is it?
28337,"I have never heard of it, I did watch the movie though. It would have been cool if they got Jennifer garner and Ben Afleck in it"
28338,Oh no! Was anything taken?
28339,You're very lucky!
28340,We all have weeks like that. Don't be too hard on yourself. Everything will get done eventually.
28341,"That must be hard, I'm sorry. Just do what you can though. I would help if I could."
28342,Thats great. Im sure it was cheaper than having to buy a brand new one.
28343,I bet. The grass has been growing so fast right now. Your yard is going to look great again.
28344,Oh my goodness! 3 months?! Where are you going?
28345,That is amazing! What places do you want to visit the most?
28346,That sounds like a great way to keep yourself motivated! 
28347,Everyone needs some way to keep them going! 
28348,What kind of job?
28349,Well confidence is key so I bet you will get the job :)
28350,"oh no, how did it happen? were you in a hurry?"
28351,"this is the worst, i can understand why you are mad, i'd be the same as you, argh im sorry"
28352,"Oh my, that is tragic. I hope you are there to support him."
28353,Good of you. Times like these can be tough and he needs all the support he can get.
28354,That is pretty hard my dude. But join some clubs or get to know some people in your dorm area.
28355,Also try joining a club you might end up in apartment with someone next year instead of the cramped dorms.
28356,Do you trust other people at all?  It seems like it would be hard to trust someone if you think only you can know what is best for you.
28357,Thats great.  It seems like you turned your life around.  It just seems like it would get lonely not being able to trust anyone.
28358,how big is it ?
28359,ah .. well i guess its not that bad yet
28360,Did you think a bear was going to eat you?
28361,Had you forgotten your pepper spray?
28362,"oh wow, this is my passion too, which EU country are you going to start first?"
28363,"i have, and i plan to travel the world in 1-2 years with my wife, spain is amazing, you're going to enjoy yourself i wish you the best"
28364,well atleast when you finish you can pop a beer and enjoy your hard work
28365,hahaha yeah or go to a nice restaurant to feel relaxed after all that hard work
28366,As reunions go I guess. How was it crazy?
28367,"Oh wow, bet you felt guilty saying no!"
28368,"Good for you.  We only get one body, gotta take care of it best we can!"
28369,"Yeah there's no escaping things that humans have chemically altered, and we consistently put in our bodies."
28370,lol. Well then darnit I want to be a unicorn.
28371,lol- Well that's true. Darn all those people who stopped me from being a unicorn. Well how on earth did you get back to earth then?
28372,Or unlikely ;)
28373,I am sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately a lot of dog breeds have a high risk of cancer.  Is it treatable?  
28374,Oh my.  I have been in that situation before.  You have my sympathies.  
28375,That sounds terrifying! I wouldn't want to stay alone either. That was nice you guys took her in.
28376,I don't blame her. I am sure she felt more at ease staying with you guys.
28377,"that is not good, why did you miss your son's game?"
28378,well if it is work then it is ok because you have to put food on the table first i can relate to that
28379,Did you try to pick her up and take her outside?
28380,You should try and use a toy or something to get her to chase dogs love those.
28381,Why do you say used to be your favorite restueraunt?
28382,Wow.. that really stinks that that happened to your favorite resteraunt 
28383,Oh no! That is horrible! Did you get it back?
28384,That must be so stressful. I am sorry.
28385,"That's cool, was it nostalgic? "
28386,"Yeah, it's crazy to think how long ago some things are"
28387,"oh no thats horrible.  Im glad i didnt see that, i wouldve been so upset"
28388,yea thats what I was thinking too.  poor doggy :(
28389,"what time was it? please becareful with these kinds of things, you were lucky and i am glad nothing happend, but people don't realise how dangerous it is at night, why were you out so late?"
28390,please becareful my friend had his phone stolen recently because of the same thing
28391,That sounds wonderful! I bet it was amazing
28392,Wow! I wish I could see something like that
28393,That is very disgusting. I hope you complained!
28394,"That is nice. Sometimes things like this do happen, but it is not something you like to see!"
28395,"oh im so sorry, please don't worry, i know it's tough but i learned that death is only a beginning not the end "
28396,"just like birth, death is the start of another process unclear to us, the unseen, and i believe in this deeply, your mother is fine, she is always there"
28397,"aww, im sorry. thats always hard"
28398,I hope you are able to make some new friends.  Or keep in touch with video calls
28399,"A road trip sounds fun, but I agree with you. I feel like I am a cab driver when people are on devices and not talking to me at all."
28400,Yeah can you take turns driving?
28401,"Good luck with that, its rough out there."
28402,I hear ya. Perhaps they will though? gotta stay positive.
28403,"That could be embarrassing, do you have a new partner?"
28404,"Oh no, let's hope she's up for some action with another girl."
28405,Did he finish it all? 
28406,What did the shirt look like?
28407,"oh god that's worse than thinking you lost your phone for a second, i am aware of the feeling, how are you feeling now"
28408,what did you learn?
28409,Did you try to find who the $20 belonged to? 
28410,I would feel guilty keeping money that I did not earn or that was not mine. Maybe you could give the $20 to charity?
28411,"Dang, that's a nice honor. Shows you what he thinks of you. I would like someone to ask me to be their best man one day! Congratulations to the both of you"
28412,"Oh yeah, I forgot that's one of your responsibilities! Well, you know your brother best, so I'm sure you'll know what to do. But if you think he won't like the typical drunken debauchery stripper party, don't do it just because it's the thing everyone does. When my brother had his wedding, we just sat around and played video games"
28413,Well its good that you are helping out your friend. I'm sure he appreciates it.
28414,It's good that you are making an effort. That's more than a lot of people do. 
28415,"oh welcome to the long distance club! i am exactly in the same situation as you, we are going on a cable car, we are going to meet in 2 weeks and i also can't wait, i feel you, LET'S HAVE  A BLAST"
28416,"Yup i totally get you, it's same here and now it feels time is going super slow, these next 2 weeks are going to be hell before i go to see her, make sure you enjoy yourself!"
28417,Oh no! That's sad
28418,why was it amazing?
28419,ah thats cool then
28420,Thats really sad.  Im sorry to hear that.  Getting old stinks.  I feel bad when I see someone who seems really lonely
28421,"Yea thats hard.  You cant do anything now, but maybe theres another neighbor that you can get close too "
28422,"That really is something to get excited about! I've never been outside of the country, so I'm jealous of people that get the chance to. I hope you're able to get everything out of the trip that you want to"
28423,"If I were you, I'd be the same way, just counting down the days. I hope your travel goes smoothly. If you're going with someone special, I hope you guys both enjoy your time there"
28424,"That sounds really annoying, i bet thats making a huge mess"
28425,Yea train her to push the stuff into the garbage can
28426,Sorry to hear that. Maybe your luck will turn around soon!
28427,I hope you weren't too jealous of him! I hope you win next time.
28428,Well if he was good at the trick its understandable. As long as you were a kid.
28429,"Wow, you better let someone else do your due diligence you might fall victims to scammers."
28430,Must be disappointing knowing the spark isn't there.
28431,"I guess, as long as you are happy enough."
28432,Im happy to hear that! That is a big step and he needs as much support as possible! 
28433,"I bet he feels so good about that, its amazing to watch a big milestone!"
28434,that stinks i'm sorry.
28435,our weather has been so extreme this year. its scary.
28436,That's awesome! What did they do?
28437,That is really cool! You have some really great coworkers!
28438,That's good! Always smart to be prepared!
28439,"Yeah, I always make sure to have things like band-aids or tape with me in case of emergencies."
28440,"Good for you, how did it turn out?"
28441,"At least you tried, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't give up."
28442,"that sucks, perhaps he should of be saving his money to pay for his apartment, instead of having two dogs."
28443,"Well that was nice of you, glad you took the dogs in."
28444,That sounds very depressing.
28445,You will for sure be next if it stays like that.
28446,Have you gone to a doctor about it yet?
28447,Well would you rather have it creep up on you out of the blue?
28448,"That sucks, I imagine nothing ever became familiar to you."
28449,"Yeah, a bit like how my employment goes."
28450,oh my goodness. what did you do? are you alright?
28451,i would have pulled into a public place or police station. i'm so sorry that happened to you but glad you are ok.
28452,Do they live far away from you?
28453,wow that is far.  I hope you guys use video chats
28454,uhoh.  I hope it was ok.
28455,ewww thats so gross.  I hope you didnt have to clean it up
28456,that is awesome. stay positive i hope things will work out.
28457,i'm so glad. marriage is tough but when you love each other it's work the effort.
28458,Oh really did you meet them from tinder
28459,"Try not to scare them away, could be your last shot at love."
28460,How did you celebrate after?
28461,What's your favorite alcohol to drink?
28462,That is pretty awesome my dude.
28463,Man that would of been cool but thinking about that was cool.
28464,Did he get soaked?
28465,That's so cool! I would love to have a car like that!
28466,"Yeah, I feel like we are living in a science fiction movie sometimes!"
28467,Thats so nice of them! Did you enjoy it?
28468,"I agree, they must really love you a lot"
28469,Well did people  help you get cleaned off.
28470,Hopefully you didn't miss the best part of the fair. That would be unlucky
28471,I love when that happens!  I did the same thing not too long ago when I was in the area I grew up in.  
28472,Yup!  It really makes you appreciate life!
28473,"Oh my, I hope it was only a sincere error and not the charger being malicious"
28474,Ugh that must be so aggravating that you can't even get your money back. I would suggest calling and telling the manager.
28475,"As you should, spitting in food is never the right answer. Hopefully you learned something from this."
28476,Oh really? Did you go check it out?
28477,Yeah I think I would have felt the same!
28478,Why inspired you to do that?
28479,"I suppose if any car should be fit for such a task, it would be a Tesla. "
28480,Sorry to hear that! It must be infuriating to have that happen
28481,"Neither would I. Hopefully, the other person is paying up for the damage at least"
28482,"that is awesome. where is your ""home""?"
28483,that is amazing. my mom never really cooked for us but she was a great mom. i bet you miss home.
28484,What are they making you feel like?
28485,"Wow, that seems bad. Why are you taking them?"
28486,"oh really, did you prepare it yourself."
28487,well good thing you listened
28488,That must have frightened you.  Was it the beef jerky sasquatch?
28489,What is a potato camera?
28490,"Oh my, how are you going to bathe and use the restroom?"
28491,As you should be! I think you need to call another plumber
28492,That's awesome. Do the people you work with know it?
28493,I hope you get a raise soon
28494,That's great! What kind of car?
28495,"Good, my son could be driving, but he doesn't have a car to drive or the real need to. He likes to walk to places"
28496,Oh no ! Did she offer to replace the cost of the plants at least ?
28497,Oh thats quite understandable then ! I try to never let small things overcome a good relationship with friends =)
28498,I am scared of those things too.  Where did you go?
28499,I don't blame you one bit!
28500,Nice! Always good to go on a date and celebrate your love.
28501,Oh! Sorry to hear that! Will you get a divorce now?
28502,Oh man that stink. I bet you will find someone though.
28503,Yeah we've all felt that at some point in life. 
28504,It must be such an exciting time for her and your family!
28505,Get a nice gift for her to let her know how happy you are for them!
28506,Do you think you have pushed your self enough or are you worried? 
28507,"Great, I wish you all the lucky in the world."
28508,"Wow you must be pretty old, did you have indoor plumping "
28509,"Well that sounds pretty fun, It must have been nice to grow up during the 60s"
28510,That's aweful! What do they do?
28511,Your boss. How do they take advantage of you?
28512,why did you not get your raise?
28513,that stinks. i know how that feels.
28514,That's awesome. Was it worth it?
28515,I hope you got plenty of photo's?
28516,that is awesome.
28517,i really wish i would be able to do so well in math
28518,What is your goal weight?
28519,"I love horses, what other sports do you play?"
28520,Did she appreciate it?
28521,"That's amazing, I would love to have some today."
28522,What was chasing you?
28523,I bet your friends were laughing the whole time!
28524,"Why are you angry, did you sister get unfairly fired?"
28525,Sounds like in the long run they will all end up fired if they don't get their money right
28526,That's great. Its good that you have a support network like that. 
28527,Are you always alone?
28528,I can imagine. Why don't you take a lyft or uber?
28529,A walking buddy then? they should be free.
28530,That's great. Is it his first year?
28531,"Wow how exciting, has he been practicing a lot? "
28532,"Its definitely not fair. It seems almost as if people do not TRY to create a friendship or are playing both ends of the candle to see which bargain (plans) per friends are better, and then make a choice"
28533,"Yes, true friends understand and will work around your schedule and won't put you off, or make you feel like you have done something wrong.  "
28534,"Sorry to hear that. My parents used to struggle with health issues too, and I'd worry just as much as they would. Do you know when it may be rescheduled for?"
28535,It sounds like you're patient and prepared to take it. I wish the best for you guys!
28536,That is good. What are some of your favorites?
28537,Those are really cool traditions.
28538,that's cool. what kind of job did you apply for?
28539,that would be amazing. i hope it works out for you.
28540,That's awesome! Why are you proud of her?
28541,Good for her. It's great that she is pursuing her dreams!
28542,What happened to your grama?
28543,"I'm sorry to hear that ,were you close?"
28544,Sounds pretty tough
28545,That is awful. I hope you are okay!!!
28546,I'm so sorry that happened to you. It must have been so scary.
28547,Well you must be very lucky then.
28548,"Things seem to go in cycles, sometimes you just got to make it through the other side."
28549,"Wow, how fast were you going?"
28550,"That can happen to anyone though. It was speeding, but at least it wasn't wreckless driving!"
28551,That is awesome. What is your future endeavor comprised of ?
28552,Thats quite the diverse field ! My son changed that major because it has too much Math involved. He graduated with an Infomatics degree
28553,What is he doing?
28554,Can't you report him?
28555,"Wow that,s exciting! What are you planning on majoring in?"
28556,That's a very interesting field. Are you nervous?
28557,Much luck to you!
28558,What was tempting you?
28559,"Yes, that sounds quite hard!  Good for you for being faithful though!"
28560,What went right last?
28561,Wow where are you working? That's amazing.
28562,I do too! Have you had a specific situation lately?
28563,That sucks. You can't really get away from that situation. Maybe look for a new job?
28564,I'm sure you'll be fine if you study enough!
28565,Excellent I hope so
28566,I hate when that happens. It's such a bummer!
28567,I'm sorry. You should go out and enjoy yourself and rub it in their face!
28568,Oh that's really cool. Was it from your childhood?
28569,Well I think it's really good you found such a cool think from your childhood
28570,Thats good wish my brother was like that.
28571,Man that just makes me jealous some.
28572,How likely is he to go ape shit?
28573,You may want to replace that beer. lol
28574,"Oh yeah, I have seen those kind of micro bikes before. Takes some skill I suppose."
28575,Maybe that's all he could spare for. Still got to stunt whenever possible. 
28576,Yep I like them too. Especially Frozen.
28577,"Oh yea, that movie was one of my favorites when I was a child"
28578,"I love cats, did you punish her?"
28579,Oh that's awesome. Finally ready for the baby? 
28580,I see. That's a long time. I wish you the best of luck this time!
28581,that is so stinking awesome
28582,it will be an adrenaline rush for sure
28583,Are you not able to make ends meet right now?
28584,That's a good attitude to have!  Stay strong!
28585,I would never be able to do that!
28586,Stay on the ground my friend.
28587,That's great! What do you have planned?
28588,That does sound like a lot of fun!
28589,That had to be a weird feeling.  How was it?
28590,"I can imagine.  Ive never been back to mine, but i can still picture in my mind what it looks like"
28591,Uh oh! I would hate that 
28592,That's always got to be the worst thing to deal with
28593,Oh yeah? What is the exam for? I hope you do well.
28594,Oh man I always found calculus to be really tough. I'm glad you seem confident. 
28595,Thats awesome.  Make sure you wear sunscreen.  Dont want to get burned
28596,I need some time off of work too.  Maybe I should take a vacation!
28597,Uh oh. A little too much to drink?
28598,That is about as bad as it can get right there. I think you might have to tell her. The guilt will eat you alive.
28599,Wow he must have been hungry as hell.
28600,oh it was one of those chalenges things?
28601,how are you doing now ?
28602,yea thats good though that you are moving forward
28603,Damn was it a bogus call or what
28604,Well I hope you'll have a better ref next time...just keep hustling
28605,"I agree, they think they're so smart but they are not!"
28606,"Exactly you got it, they will make their mistakes."
28607,I know the feeling.  I wish i could go back to being little again
28608,yea and I didnt have to go to work!
28609,What was the bad thing about it?
28610,Man that does sound scary! I hope that it didn't follow you home!
28611,That's great! He sounds like a good addition in your life.
28612,"Awe I love my dog too, she's really sweet. Well except my dog doesn't listen, so I guess your dog beats mine, lol."
28613,Are you jealous of them?
28614,"That sucks, i just had a massive meal myself."
28615,Hopefully you do well with it!
28616,You will get in and do great things!
28617,"ohno, what did you have? what was bad about it?"
28618,ewww that sounds disgusting.  I would have complained
28619,That was really nice of you. Did you find it?
28620,Well keep looking and maybe check the local animal shelters if you haven't already.
28621,That's pretty compassionate of you!
28622,Do you have any pets of your own? you sound like an animal person
28623,Good times indeed!  Those were the days.  It seems cliche to say they were simpler times because I remember them saying that back then about when they were younger.  History repeats itself.
28624,When I think of Christmas with families I tend to think about National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  A classic.
28625,how come? is everything alright?
28626,that would be great. i'm hoping all goes well with you.
28627,I hope everything goes well! What are you worried about?
28628,Well I hope that it is nothing serious. 
28629,That's great! 
28630,I hope he does!
28631,Wow. I wish something like that would happen to me. That is so cool.
28632,Maybe you can pay it forward next time you see someone buying a drink.
28633,Are you sure they were werewolves and not regular wolves?
28634,when is the beat down scheduled for and how can i help?
28635,"no no, we need revenge. think about it and let me know"
28636,I think that way too!
28637,"If you expect the worst, you won't be disappointed. "
28638,Hate when that happens...if it happens more than once you can file a complaint with the city council
28639,Or next time stand in the garbageman's way at your neighbor's to confront him about it haha
28640,who? is everything alright?
28641,oh my goodness i'm so sorry. i really hope she comes back soon
28642,Do you have a plan made up?
28643,"I think you can do this, I'm proud of you."
28644,Whats your first step in the plan to get back on track?
28645,"I love Nintendo, I use to play every time."
28646,I know. The news said it was 100% but nothing so far.
28647,It cool things off a little bit too. We could use it.
28648,were you in bed with your roommate ?
28649,oh yuk. next time threesome! goodluck
28650,That is impressive! Where they ok afterwards?
28651,That's what they get for eating that much food!
28652,I'm sure you did great! I hate public speeking.
28653,I bet! Well it over now and I'm sure you did great!
28654,Is the friend a female?
28655,Should you be worried?
28656,Oh shoot! That's never fun. Did you get a ticket?
28657,That was very lucky!
28658,Dammmnn is your cat ok??
28659,That is f***king ridiculous I would've chased that car down and beat the living s**t out of the driver
28660,You sound like you'd be a good therapist.
28661,"It's been to be humble than rude or mean, that's my motto."
28662,That's great that you had such a good time. You sound like a good parent!
28663,That really is. When I comes down to it what a kid wants most from a parent is love. 
28664,Oh no! Why are you worried about that?
28665,Well it is good that you are prepared. It is always important to have extra supplies in case of an emergency. 
28666,Whoa!  I saw his initial performance and was blown away!  That must have been amazing to see!
28667,That is good news!  I'm sure you will look forward to it as will I
28668,Oh no!  I remember doing something similar when I was younger.  There was a pool outside of our screen door.  I went to run and jump into the pool from in the house and smashed right through it!
28669,Gotta roll with it!  Just play it off at that point.
28670,know it all people drive me nuts too
28671,people need to learn and be humble honeslty
28672,Are you a college student? Or just living far away from them
28673,Wow that's pretty far...do you call/facetime them during the week?
28674,"Oh no, that sucks man. I hope you didn't miss out on too much when you had to go into work."
28675,"Oh well that is convenient, good thing that they didn't remember that it was the day that you had requested off. Lol."
28676,How did that happen? I am so sorry.
28677,Well at least it sounds like you lost some weight. Dont let it get to you that much though.
28678,what is the job for?
28679,"oh wow, well best of luck!"
28680,"good, any plans of leaving?"
28681,Hey me too! What are you looking forward to the most about it!
28682,Yeah it's going to be great!
28683,that is great reason!
28684,oh yea its out in december right ?
28685,its gonna be epic 
28686,"Oh no, I've never had a cat because my husband and brother are allergic. Is she trying to mark her terriorty?"
28687,I bet! Maybe get her checked and see if she has a UTI or if its just behavioral.  Ask on your local pet page if its normal for cats.
28688,"oh, well just talk louder!"
28689,I'm more of a dallas fan myself.
28690,We will for sure win this year!
28691,It sure is.  It is an important step in this road we call life.
28692,And now he can focus on the next phase of his life.  Which should be exciting
28693,why did it go off?
28694,"oh, well you live and you learn"
28695,That is a strange scenario. Do you live in chicago.
28696,"Oh wow, yeah that is a pretty terrible place. Your should get out."
28697,Nice. What was his first day?
28698,How it went for hime? Did he cry?
28699,I would be so frustrated.  Do you have any way to make him do the necessary fixes?
28700,I don't blame you!  It might cost more to sue than to break the lease and move.
28701,I wish you the most success.
28702,That sounds really good! I'm kind of jealous1
28703,What kind of cheesecake are you thinking of eating?
28704,Oh no. Whats wrong? Why are you going?
28705,I'm sorry I hope it nothing serious. I hope it just seems bad but is easily fixable. 
28706,I know exactly how you feel. Sometimes it is for the best if they are suffering though.
28707,Oh definitely. I can say that it does get better with time. 
28708,"wow, that is awesome, go you!"
28709,well sometimes luck is in your favor!
28710,That is exciting! You'll have some free mommy time or be able to go to work while they are in school. 
28711,"Defenitly! Plus the first few week of school can be hectic, it'll be nice to have that downtime after you drop them off."
28712,Where were you when you noticed that is broke? Maybe it's possible to find it!
28713,I'm sure you feel terrible about it. I hope you can find a replacement for it or have it fixed!
28714,oh that sucks .. celebrate during the weekend
28715,there is always next year!
28716,"oh, I am sorry to hear that..."
28717,MY little cousins are too. They love that game
28718,I have watched them before but never played.
28719,that is not in your control!
28720,"awesome, get any pictures?"
28721,Yeah me to. It's going to be so great!
28722,I think the new characters will be really cool to play with. 
28723,Thats pretty cool...what's the number one thing you're most grateful for
28724,"That's great, I'm thankful for my self-employed status and all the money I'm making for my future family.  Wish y'all the best"
28725,"i can totally relate. i'm currently on a medication that has me feeling mentally, emotionally, and physically ill"
28726,i'm switching to my new pill tomorrow and i'm hoping that i will have better results
28727,"I'm sorry to hear that, I have two dogs and know how they become part of the family."
28728,"I know, it's defenitly painful to have to go through but its part of life. Maybe get a new puppy to start loving/sharing life with, shelters have so many dogs that need homes!"
28729,"Oh okay, sorry about not getting off for work. I hope the new pizza place is good at least. "
28730,Uhhhhh..... you okay man? I advise against arson.
28731,Wouldnt that be something... I suppose you're a massive fan of them
28732,"That is some dedication, will you go to watch it live in the stadium?"
28733,why did you do that?
28734,That is very annoying. Did you talk to them?
28735,Did you try to talk to your landlord?
28736,That's terible. Did you call the police? There has to be consequences
28737,It still could and it could be worse. I hope not for your sake
28738,Aww thats great! Sounds like you two are a power couple!
28739,"Sounds like you two are the perfect match, cherish your marriage."
28740,"I agree, its one of best smallest things in life that make it worth it"
28741,"Yup, I make it a point to have dinner with a friend every now and then"
28742,Oh that dont sound really good
28743,"I think you make a wise decision, never drink too much again"
28744,you better be cause im coming for it
28745,you wanna put some cash on it or what
28746,Oh that's too bad. Maybe you could have someone walk with you?
28747,Whatever makes you feel safe!
28748,I bet you'll have a little extra power now
28749,That's awesome!  You should get back to work and kick some butt :)
28750,Why weird
28751,Oh haha well that'll be interesting...at least the kids will feel good that they were braver than Mommy hahaha
28752,"Ah I am an eagles fan, but we finally got you this year"
28753,"that is funny, you gotta be aware when in the presence of greatness"
28754,Good.  It's important that we all feel satsified with our situations.
28755,"Well I hope nothing changes, and you stay happy forever!"
28756,I've never been into pokemon but my brother is a big fan. When does the game come out?
28757,Thanks! Maybe I will get it for his birthday in November. I will have to look into it.
28758,You should use it as fuel and keep going.
28759,Then you need something to motivate you. Try watching the Rocky II
28760,Are you leaving on a jet plane?  I am guessing you are going on vacation?
28761,Nice.  I love Florida.  What part of the state are you going to?
28762,You could have gone to a bar and found some friends 
28763,That's what the alcohol is for lol
28764,Oh wow I hope you are save did you have to evacuate to a shelter or to family house away?
28765,Glad you and your family is safe and let's just hope the storm passes by and cause no damage to home town.
28766,Did it tear up your car?
28767,The guy didnt even stop did he?
28768,"Aw, I bet she makes your life so much more happier. "
28769,You must have taught her to be very well behaved
28770,Oh shucks that's bad!  Did you call in sick?
28771,oh haha.  Awesome!  Now what are you gonna do?
28772,what are you gonna do 
28773,"Oh no, were you able to get into you work ?"
28774,I'm sure you will not be the first or the last to lose one of those.  My husband has lost his a few times as well.  Hopefully it's a simple process to get a new one made.
28775,"Oh, I'm sure that's a bit boring have you had fun stuff to do?"
28776,"I'm sorry to hear that. If your neighborhood is rough take precautions, otherwise maybe try to find a tea or something to help sooth."
28777,Lucky! I love when that happens! 
28778,"Yum, sounds like a good use of the money! Hopefully you find some more spare money haha"
28779,"I imagine that was a pleasure that was simple at one time, but one you really appreciated when you came back. Thanks for your service!"
28780,Absolutely! It can often take really significant events to happen before we realize it too. 
28781,"That sucks, I hope you found your dog."
28782,What a bummer. Landlords suck for the most part. 
28783,Do you have a lease?
28784,"I understand. Me too, I don't like people talking too much."
28785,Are you still seeing him?
28786,Did he give her a haircut?
28787,How long did you live her with him for?
28788,Oh no. Did the waitress realize it before you left?
28789,"I see. Well if you go there again, be sure to leave her a bigger one!"
28790,ewwww did you eat it??
28791,haha I bet.  Did it smell too?
28792,Should have fed it to the birds!!
28793,haha hopefully not :D
28794,Oh yeah? What kind of restaurant? 
28795,"Oh cool, I hope it ends up being nice and tasty."
28796,"Oh wow that sounds scary, I hope your alright? "
28797,"Thats great, glad someone you knew passed by. Hope its not going to be expensive to fix."
28798,I'm very glad you can rely on yourself!  I def trust you already.
28799,"I'll email you right away, keep a look out for that :-)"
28800,That is pretty exciting :) do you have kids of your own
28801,Nice looks like you're gonna be racking up some babysitting hours..lol hope you're ready 
28802,Nicde
28803,"No, I never had."
28804,Man that's pretty gross
28805,I would switch computers...or ask him if he's found gold yet
28806,That was really nice. I hope you had a good dinner.
28807,Sounds like you have a really nice brother. You are very lucky!
28808,"That's interesting, I haven't seen a good magic show in a while."
28809,"Very cool, I hope more people continue to recognize his talent and he gets the acclaim he deserves."
28810,Sounds like a great lady.  I am glad you are appreciative of her 
28811,Yes it is.  You should take her out to dinner or something to say thank you.
28812,Happy birthday! Did you have fun?
28813,That sounds like a lot of fun. You have some pretty great coworkers!
28814,I know how that is. What happened?
28815,That is so sad. I have dealt with something similar. Good luck!
28816,Ive been there. It gets old real quick.
28817,Just try and keep a low profile and stay busy. 
28818,How did she get them if they were sold out?
28819,Wow thats awsome man. Who are you seeing?
28820,"That sounds horrible, and scary"
28821,What did you do after
28822,"Aw, I hate it when that happens, but I bet the relative understands.  Sometimes things come up."
28823,They've probably been on the other side of this situation before.
28824,Sounds fun!  Where ya headed to?
28825,Oh cool.  Sounds like fun!  Be safe!
28826,Are you excited for them
28827,That sounds like a good year to me
28828,That's awesome! What are you going to study?
28829,That's really cool! Good luck!
28830,"That's awful I'm sorry to hear that, what are you planning on doing?"
28831,"Definitely, I'd look to move on if I was you."
28832,"I love me some pumpkin pie, whats she going through?"
28833,"I'm sorry to hear that, I love animals. I hope she cheers up."
28834,"Are you nervous about which schools you might get accepted for, or do you feel good about it?"
28835,"Oh wow, yeah you should have no problem! I did just fine with way worse than that."
28836,"I bet, that is a great achievment! Loosing weight is hard! Keeping it off is even harder. "
28837,You can do it! Keep up the hard work :)

28844,"Um, you seem really upbeat and happy!"
28845,Are you really excited about somthing going on in your life?
28846,That sucks so much. I hope there isn't any tension between you and your friend.
28847,"I hope you can both work it out, it would be awful for a friendship to end over something like that."
28848,What happened to him
28849,That sounds very painful. I am sure they were glad you came with them
28850,That is very good news. It means that you are doing a great job.
28851,What are you planning to do with the money?
28852,"I love Halloween, what is horrors night?"
28853,"That's fun, do the ghosts chase you around?"
28854,Ah you aren't a big fan of tomatos?
28855,"Yes, if you requested no tomato, you should get a refund!"
28856,What does that even mean?
28857,"Interesting, what caused you to do that?"
28858,What's your favorite kind of cake flavor
28859,Ice ice baby widen your horizons maybe can't identify with the girl or guy who shy's away from chocolate cake b***h u craayy
28860,Yeah and I understand. It's not for everybody!
28861,lol why?

28863,You should turn the lights on!
28864,Did you call him to complain about that?
28865,"That's awful, my air conditioner is cleaned thankfully. "
28866,I'm right there with you!  That is the best thing in the world! Are you there now?  I'm talking to my husband about moving to the beach permanently.
28867,I'm so jealous!  I haven't been in years now!  Breathe in the salt air for me!
28868,"You must be a savior to him, is he paying you for that?"
28869,"Very true, I hope he knows how lucky he is."
28870,Have you been working hard in the off season?
28871,You sound very confident. Sounds like you put in the work. Good luck.
28872,That is great how do you think you did?
28873,Congratulations that is so awesome to have passed such a intense exam.
28874,Uh oh! Are they picky?
28875,That's not cheap at all! 
28876,Are you gonna complain to someone about it?
28877,I am sorry to hear that then...
28878,I understand. I had the same feeling. When did she passed away?
28879,How old was she when she passed away?
28880,"good stuff, you picked a good time to do it!"
28881,"wow that is pretty soon, it snuck up on me"
28882,Me too!  I used to be able to watch some when I was younger but then I realized I was torturing myself because I hate them!
28883,I agree.  They literally haunt you forever.
28884,"oh, that makes sense. why yesterday then?"
28885,Oh I am sorry to hear that. You must have been close to her.
28886,"Yes, at least you have those memories of her to cherish and hold forever."
28887,"I get that, but money talks at the end of the day"
28888,That is what it comes down to sometimes!
28889,"That is always tough to deal with.  Time can help, but it can't get you over the loss of a loved one."
28890,"I agree.  Things can always get better, just remember her and honor her the best that you can."
28891,I can imagine so! I bet you are one tired person when you hit the bed at night!
28892,I hope you do! I really wish you the best.
28893,I bet that will be fun. Do you do that a lot
28894,I need to game more when I can
28895,Well with what?
28896,Well best of luck!
28897,That's awesome!   What does she do?
28898,That's amazing!  What a commendable job!  Good for her!
28899,"Wow I love nintendo, you should get an NES classic!"
28900,I am so sorry to hear it! 
28901,Hopefully you can go back and get it! 
28902,That sounds like a lot of fun! What were some of your favorite games to play?
28903,That is really cool. It's nice that you could rediscover a bit of your childhood. 
28904,Thats great news. Where you expecting it?
28905,Well that is great. Sounds like you really deserved it.
28906,That's a rip off at that price.
28907,Did you ever try netflix? It's great.
28908,wow. thats kind of cruel
28909,What is that game about
28910,"That sounds really fun, I am sure it will be good"
28911,"that is good, it has been hot here recently"
28912,"that is good, cherish that stuff while it lasts!"
28913,That is very nice to have someone providing support
28914,Good. It is important to be open about all subject. Is she accepting it?
28915,Did you tell him about it or no?
28916,You should tell him he will like you for it.
28917,Aww dangit!  Maybe he'll let you drive it
28918,And then just keep driving and don't take it back lol
28919,I have been there. It is nice to have those memories
28920,"i get that, I have one coming up as well"
28921,"just stay calm and collected, talk slowly, gather your thought"
28922,That is so awesome. I hope you show them how grateful you are.
28923,Well I am sure you deserve it. Just take real good care of it.
28924,That is great you should follow up with them in a few days.
28925,I was going to ask if it was for a manager that is awesome you got this they will be hiring you on the spot.
28926,"I have.  It was a long time ago.  I had a lot of fun watching it with my daughter but I always feel sad for the animals, until I found out that the circus I went to helps injured animals have a home."
28927,Yes!  I'm very much against animal cruelty but not every circus is bad thankfully.  Do you love the circus?
28928,Did you see the person that got shot when it happened?
28929,Oh no! Are they just scared?
28930,I'm so happy for her! Hopefully everything goes well for her
28931,"Oh no, I'm sorry man. Hopefully next time. Were you at least able to reach out and see what you could improve upon? "
28932,I bet that is pretty disappointing. Maybe some ice cream will make you feel better.
28933,"You are saying it as if it's a bad thing, are you left without friends?"
28934,"My friend just stay strong, family and kids can suck you life away(not always of course)."
28935,I guess you got an A?
28936,"Well done, what other exams are left?"
28937,Where have you been traveling
28938,Oh that sounds very exotic
28939,Maybe you can catch up on some sleep?
28940,I know it will feel lonely but a good weekend to recharge will do some good.
28941,Are yall gonna go on a date?
28942,what is the dinner?
28943,Yum!!!!! I literally just watched a recipe on how to make a vegan chocolate cake so I'm craving one!  With tons of icing!
28944,Yum! Have a piece for me!!
28945,Yeah that must have been a trip down memory lane.

28948,It will always be a nice reminder then
28949,You got some good new? 
28950,I cant think of better way to have fun with friends. Sounds like a great time.
28951,I understand. He need to rest and take a nap.
28952,You should. Thats not nice
28953,well i hope you learned your lesson
28954,Health is truly a blessing! How old are your children? 
28955,I agree. I can't imagine what it must be like to be a parent and go through that. 
28956,Eww! I really hate olives also. What things do you like in your salad?
28957,"I'm just a plain salad person, but I do like my bacon bits and croutons in a salad. Also some carrots."
28958,That is very tense to be waiting on that kind of call you got this positive thoughts only. What position is it for?
28959,Just be patient you aced it and you will get that position and call soon. 
28960,Ohhhh sophomore year can be tough. How do you feel about that?
28961,"Wow. He's taking on quite a lot, but it'll be good for building his character as he gets older!"
28962,Oh that's awesome!   Congrats!!
28963,I hope it's a baby!!!! Good luck!
28964,"Oh wow, how were you doing that? "
28965,"I'm sorry you feel bad about it now. I'm not really sure what I can say, it's not like you can change the past. You could try volunteering. "
28966,Why so interestin?
28967,I know the feeling. Do you huys get to talk?
28968,Why was it not a good day? What happened?
28969,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  My father in law had to have hospice and although it's not what you want to hear, the people that work with hospice are really a lifeline for the family."
28970,That sounds like a lot of fun I have never been to one before.
28971,I may to check one out. I like trying out new places.
28972,What kind of test is it
28973,oh yea what is the meeting about ?
28974,"oh that sounds interesting, good luck"
28975,I have seen them eat bigger
28976,Why that response?
28977,"Yes, the lines are a pain."
28978,What was the news?
28979,"That's so tragic, did the doctor say what happened?"
28980,Have you been studying for it?  I hope you do well.
28981,Then hopefully you will do really well on it.  It's normal to be a bit apprehensive before a big test though.
28982,"Really, where is that?"
28983,Well at least you are not in the middle of the flight.
28984,"Very wise of you, experiences are all that matters."
28985,"I see, but you do realize that happiness for the most part is immaterial, right?"
28986,Do you feel guilty now?
28987,How are you going to make up for it?
28988,What a nice surprise. What was the card for?
28989,What is limiting your ability to visit?
28990,"Don't be, it's a destructive emotion. "
28991,"Isn't it grand, I bet we no very little authentic information about them."
28992,I bet they are much older than we believe them to be.
28993,I would be sad about that! I'm so sorry
28994,Did you finally get it working ?
28995,Is doctor pepper your favorite?
28996,"That's awful, sorry to hear that. I love me some Sprite."
28997,Thats interesting
28998,Thats awesome. How was the first day for him?
28999,"oh wow, i wish i could go there, do you plan to return one day ?"
29000,that is something i hope to do one day as well. good luck
29001,That's the best way to go in to an interview. How do you think it went?
29002,Oh congratulations! What kind of job? 
29003,I am so sorry. It happens to everyone and no one is ever prepared for it
29004,"Thats the only bad thing about having animals, you are going to outlive them"
29005,Is you cat ok now? What do you think it is?
29006,Most likely. They can be skittish little things.
29007,That's awesome!  Congrats!!
29008,Wow!  That's a long hard battle!  Poor little kitty
29009,Which amusement park?
29010,Roller coasters are fun but you should stay safe too.
29011,What other rides should you take?
29012,That's one thing I don't miss is having someone stay above me did they dog make lot's of noise?
29013,That is so rude and disgusting I know you was a tad bit furious. 
29014,That would make me SO angry. What kind of drugs is it? I would make sure the police took him out.
29015,Well I have the same issue..they aren't afraid..they're just corrupt..but I just yell at those people myself. I don't put up with the ghetto corrupt crap
29016,Is he a pervert?
29017,That's great!  Did she move recently?  Do you miss her?
29018,I'm sorry.  That can be so tough when you're used to her being so close.  Did she move far away?
29019,wow. Where are you going?
29020,omg. that is going to  be so nice
29021,It is good to have someone that can provide support. Do you have a depression?
29022,It is very nice from her.
29023,Are you disappointed with it?
29024,I feel like you should take it up with him.
29025,I cant imagine how much that hurts.. I would be so sad.
29026,It always hurts more when its unexpected. Hopefully time heals.
29027,Where are you vacationing too?
29028,"I love the heat, you're going to be melting up in Florida though."
29029,I can only do about 5 don't feel bad do you try them often? 
29030,If you practice everyday you will get better I was the same way.
29031,I love seafood! What kind of seafood dishes? 
29032,Awesome! Cooking can be pretty hard and it's an essential skill to have.
29033,what is bugging you today
29034,you didnt get an invite ?
29035,"Oh, did you have plans after work?"
29036,"So sorry you had to miss it, maybe take him out to ice cream to console him"
29037,That's fantastic. It always feels good inside when you make a good impression. 
29038,That would be so nice for you. I really hope it works out. 
29039,"Cool, what's truffle oil got to do with mac and cheese?"
29040,"Oh okay, that sounds good"
29041,Oh yeah me too! Even though it makes me a little nervous to think about it.
29042,"That's a good idea. I'd feel better doing it that way, at least the first time."
29043,"That's great, your hardwork totally payed off"
29044,Stay positive and keep up the good work!
29045,That sounds like fun! Which amusement park?
29046,"In that case, more terrifying than fun. I hope you find rides you'll enjoy and not fear!"
29047,Oh thats's nice
29048,Mine too. I love the trees in fall
29049,What did she or he do lately?
29050,Do you plan on arguing to him about it?
29051,I didn't even know that was a thing. Im sorry
29052,"uh I've heard way too many people experience that. Why don't people just not hit you in the first place, if they don't want to take responsibility?"
29053,I really wish those people who get fined just like those traffic cameras that send you tickets in the mail for speeding. It would really reduce hit and runs.
29054,Wow I wish I could make a change like that!
29055,Long time but I'm sure very beneficial
29056,what kind of cake cake cake?
29057,oh you try baking it with the cherries on already ? its great
29058,That sounds like a lot of fun! Who ya going with?
29059,Very nice! I bet your more than excited about it!
29060,Oh no! Dont be anxious or worried! I'm sure you did good on the application. 
29061,Have more confidence in yourself! Take pride in your work! 
29062,what did you try?
29063,yea it looks gross
29064,Oh that sounds delicious!  I bet you could do it!
29065,Did that guy finish it?  Did he get an award of any kind? 
29066,That's rude. Do it they do that often?
29067,You should definitely talk to them about that.
29068,I love fried rice
29069,Oh. I am the same with lemon icebox pies and my grandmother
29070,It is very nice from him. Until what time did you work?
29071,It should very hard to work that late.
29072,It happens sometime. Just try not to forget next time.
29073,Eek! Sounds pretty scary! I hate to be alone at night. 
29074,Yeah pretty creepy. Turn on some music or something so you don't get too nervous or anxious. 
29075,"Headaches really suck, I'm so sorry to hear that. Any idea why you've been getting bad ones?"
29076,"It could be. Also may be related to dehydration, and eye strain related to visual problems. Try and drink more water and have your eyes checked to be sure!"
29077,"That sounds exciting, what kind of restaurant is it?"
29078,OO that sounds snazzy!  Perhaps that will also mean bigger tips!  I hope you do amazing on your interview with them.
29079,She must be so excited! How long will you guys be there for?
29080,Wow. That's a lot of places. Sounds fun!
29081,I'm sorry to hear that. What's got you feeling so tired?
29082,"Being a parent really is a thankless job, until your kids get older and realize how tough it is."
29083,"Wow, your dog is that cat's hero!"
29084,I bet your dog is pretty smart. I mean she was able to notice a cat in danger and helped out and all.
29085,I don't understand why people just don't break up. Why cheat?
29086,"People are just so inconsiderate sometimes. Even if you don't love the person anymore, at least treat them like someone you used to love."
29087,Oh no! Im sorry. Im sure your excited now!
29088,Oh no! IM glad your no longer feeling hungry. I bet your content with it now
29089,Oh man! That would scare the heck out of me 
29090,Would that even change anything?
29091,i only do that at the seafood buffet.
29092,I used to work at a buffet lol. You're not the only person who over ate at a buffet before
29093,"That sounds delicious, do you know how to make it now?"
29094,You sound like a great parent. you should pass down the recipe to your kids too
29095,"Wow, why stay with him for so long if she was going to say no?"
29096,"Yeah man, that sucks"
29097,Tell him he owes you one now. Can't just be taking people's ice cream.
29098,"Oh man, now I want some ice cream."
29099,Oh.  What happened?
29100,Oh that's amazing!!! What did you name her?
29101,She won't remember that for much longer.
29102,"I would be too, does she live in a bad neighbourhood?"
29103,"That's smart, you sound like a good sibling to her"
29104,It will happen eventually. Enjoy being single while you can.
29105,It will come to you when you least expect it! Until then enjoy yourself!
29106,"Oh no, people are so reckless."
29107,I hope it isn't too expensive to have repaired.
29108,Yea? How'd it go?
29109,That's amazing! Congratulations!
29110,Do you feel more lonely?
29111,You should consider getting some new roomies.
29112,I assume that this job turned out to be the complete opposite of what you expected?
29113,"I'm so happy to hear that! Often, many people find themselves stuck at jobs they hate and it isn't healthy."
29114,How long have you had your cat? Mine used to be like that.
29115,ah a little old lady. Has she always ignored you?
29116,Oh does she feel weird about that? Where does she work?
29117,"Yeah, hopefully they will hire more women soon"
29118,Oh no.  Did something happen?
29119,Yikes!!  I bet that was scary!
29120,"oh cool, did it get the job done ?"
29121,Reeboks? Save your jealousy lol
29122,I have like 20 pairs of converse lol. I love them
29123,Where are you meeting her?
29124,You should try to get on tinder.
29125,I wish I could be broke doing something as cute. Seriously that's awesome in a way.
29126,"I know how you feel. There's a rabbit that lives under my shed, and I try and feed it. "
29127,That makes two of us! Big old baby dogs are the cutest though.
29128,Ah pets. What could we do without them?
29129,"Yeah, and it's not too far away from halloween now"
29130,I went to one and I kicked a ghost because it tried to grab me haha
29131,Did you discipline him?
29132,Awe is it too warm out? Keep him inside more.
29133,What happended?
29134,Did you not like the person?
29135,What is she doing to boys?
29136,"Wow that's no good at all, do you have any idea how to fix it?"
29137,That's awesome. When will you get your results?
29138,Have you started?
29139,"Man. I should start, too."
29140,"That is a good friend, but I'm sorry you tore your pants.  Why were you climbing a fence?"
29141,"Well, at least your friend was there to help you out.  Maybe you should have picked up a sewing kit at the grocery store to try to fix the jeans also - LOL!"
29142,What do you plan on doing while you're alone?
29143,You are an inspiration to me. I need to hit the gym.
29144,lol is he younger or older?
29145,Ouch that's awful!  Did you get it back yet?
29146,Sheesh.  How much was it?
29147,That's bad I'm sorry :(
29148,Are you switching jobs? Does the new one offer more money?
29149,"Ahh, maybe you can ask your boss for a raise instead? Haha"
29150,Oh did you? What happened?!
29151,uh oh when was the last time you checked your weight before this?
29152,That's awesome. You must have trained really hard.
29153,That's great dedication! I just know it will go well!
29154,Nice! I bet your excited about it. I love trying new places. 
29155,"Yes it is! Thats sounds disappointing, but Im glad you found a new place you will hopefully like. "
29156,"Yikes, maybe it's time to switch banks"
29157,"Oof, are they even allowed to do something like that?"
29158,That is bad. You should have immediately gotten a towel and dry yourself. You could get sick
29159,Did you spend the whole day with wet clothes at work? Didn't the manager allow you to go home and change?
29160,I hope you studied for it!
29161,That's great! I hope you do well on your exam! Reward yourself after too
29162,"Well, I think that all depends on where you're eating and how much you eat. Do you think you're eating anywhere unhealthy?"
29163,"Mine too. Whenever I go, I tend to get 10 happy meals. Gotta get all those toys!"
29164,Oh god. Did anyting get stuck on your car?
29165,Wow. Would have drove that car straight through the car wash.
29166,Nice! Where are you going to go? 
29167,That sounds like a very romantic destination. I wish you the best of luck.
29168,Oh no! Whats taking you so long. Are you having sentimental moments?
29169,"I know it can be upsetting and emotional, but Im sure you are happy!"
29170,haha that's awesome!  Congrats to him!
29171,LOL they sure do!  Do they have any babies yet?
29172,Oh yea? Where ya headed?
29173,The beach is awesome. Have fun!
29174,What things are you wanting to go as planned?
29175,"Very true, I am sure those instructions are forth coming.  He wouldn't leave us hanging."
29176,I can't even imagine what would make them ban certain dogs to begin with
29177,I've heard that fear makes people do all sorts of crazy things.
29178,"I admire people who can care for dogs, i can barely take care of myself!"
29179,"I was only 18 when my daughter was born, had no idea what i was  getting into!!!"
29180,Does he get anything else?
29181,"Oooh, that doesn't sound great, but at least he's not causing any trouble. It's hot outside, everyone needs some clean water"
29182,Hmm..I think we've all been there one time or another.  Are you going to admit it?
29183,"Well you certainly don't want that hanging over your head for the rest of your life.  It sounds like you have a good moral outlook on life, I think you have to admit it."
29184,Oh no! Why did you cancel? That's the best time to go!
29185,That's a really good reason to do so. Wouldn't want his mom getting any sicker with no one around.
29186,You should go for it! How long have you known her?
29187,"that's cute, you guys will be very happy together I think"
29188,You should totally go!
29189,"If there's a time to treat yourself, it's definitely on your birthday!"
29190,Im so sorry! I bet your very sad right now!
29191,"Im sorry to hear this. Times like this can be terrifying, but you can get through it. "
29192,Why did you decide to tell your mom you washed it?
29193,"That's okay, sometimes little white lies like that won't harm anyone!"
29194,"Oh my god, that's so sad to hear. How is he holding up?"
29195,"Aw, cheer up, friend. It's rough now, but it will get better! Maybe you two should go to the pet store to try and find a new dog for him!"
29196,"Me either, so rude! It happens too often. "
29197,Yeah people who do that have zero self awareness. :/ 
29198,That's so great! You guys have been able to stay close after so long! You must be very compatible with each other
29199,Amazing! I wish I had some friends like that in my life
29200,I know what you mean!  I've been homeschooling my girls forever it seems and my oldest graduates this spring.  I'm ready to be done with school too - LOL!
29201,Oh no. How long will he be away for?
29202,Maybe you can get him on Skype or something?
29203,Oh no! Did you look in the places you've been all day?
29204,That's so sad. I hope your spouse won't be too upset with you.
29205,Do you pull it up?
29206,That wouldn't be good.
29207,Were you in a tight spot? How much did you borrow?
29208,What a good friend to lend you money in your time of need. You should thank him and take him to dinner after everything is sorted.
29209,Did you perform well?
29210,Don't worry. You'll get good score.
29211,OH man! I bet you were overwhelmed! did you stay faithful to her?
29212,Thats good! I would of been anxious to get out of that place if that happend. 
29213,Oh no! Why are you nervous?
29214,What topics will the exam be covering?
29215,I hope so too! Do you know if he is planning on proposing anytime soon?
29216,"Bah, he should just do it already! In the wise words of the late Rhiana: ""If you like it you should put a ring on it""."
29217,How come? Were you scared of the dark?
29218,Oh no! Did your parents check your closet before tucking you into bed?
29219,Oh no! I know car problems can be frusterating. 
29220,I hear ya. Stay hopefull. It will come soon with dertermination. 
29221,I agree. Im sure you will find something. I get anxious for new things as well. 
29222,Awesome!  Cute kitties!  Did you feed them
29223,Yeah.  you can always take them to the shelter or post on FB if someone wants to adopt them!
29224,Wow. That's pretty amazing. So many people break up so easily.
29225,She's a lucky gal!
29226,These people are becoming so pathetic and out of touch with reality that logic and reasoning are becoming an aliens to them
29227,People at CNN and the whole liberal media who ignore the reality of the people's lives and try to project their own moral wonderland onto them
29228,Then be as prepared as you can.
29229,Why do you feel bad?
29230,Oh. I'm sure she didn't mind it. Dogs seem to be a lot less sensitive than people. 
29231,Very good! I bet your anticipating a good turn out!
29232,Well you prepared really well. I feel you will do well on this test!
29233,Where did you lie? I'm on a new diet that I'm really happy with
29234,"Yeah I know, it's time for us to get healthy!"
29235,"I love Canada, do you speak French?"
29236,Where did you grow up?
29237,That is a miracle.
29238,I hope you make sure the dog is on a leash from now on.
29239,It will be here before you know it.  Are you a big Georgia fan?
29240,"Wow, that is exciting.  The first game of the season is always the best one. "
29241,oh congratulations to your friend!
29242,I wish them the best! Have fun at the wedding!
29243,"Ooh, where are they going?"
29244,"Wow, I have a friend that went there for school too!"
29245,"Being nervous is totally understandable. They chose you, so they definitely think you can do it!"
29246,"Hey, you'll be going up that ladder and will be looking back at how much you've accomplished one day."
29247,Oh no! Have you gone up to check if there's a leak? 
29248,Oh gosh yeah be careful...I hope it stops raining soon :( 
29249,That sounds scary! Has your place been broken into?
29250,What did they take from you?
29251,"Oh no, I hope you find him."
29252,"He's probably just gone on holiday, I'm sure he will come back with gifts."
29253,What was the prize?
29254,Did you keep the pen or sell it?
29255,"Oh no, Did you lose it?"
29256,That's good. Glad ya got it back!
29257,It's good. Do you prepare him that ?
29258,It's lovely. What's her name?
29259,I am so sorry to hear that. Do you have a job? Where do you work that you could not make even a rent payment?
29260,So where are you spending your nights? Are there any homeless shelters provided by the social services?
29261,"Nice, you must look like The Hulk."
29262,I run every day.
29263,It'll take some getting used to. Keep at it!
29264,Are you a hockey fan?
29265,"That's great! I also have a cat, she's so precious"
29266,"A couple years, she's a persian mix"
29267,Oh no you should buy her a new one!
29268,I'm sorry :(   I bet she got upset
29269,Then why are you excite about it?
29270,Oh I didn't know that was really happening.
29271,So does that mean she isn't chubby now? Or still chubby but grew into it?
29272,That's good to hear. So did you match with her on tindr or something?
29273,Nice! Is it a fancy One?
29274,Very nice! Were you excited to drive it?
29275,I'm sorry to hear that.  You should have some friends over.  Throw a party and catch up on old times.
29276,"Yeah, it's always good to hang out with friends.  That cheers me up when I'm down."
29277,"That is awesome, was he scared of you?"
29278,"me too, I'm long overdue to go to the dentist"
29279,"ugh, I know, I just keep putting it off, nasty root canal"
29280,No. What is it?
29281,What is it about
29282,Why did you guys get divorced?
29283,"Well, then it seems like it was a good choice.  Next time around you will know more what to look for before getting married.  I hope you find someone that matches up better with you."
29284,Did you like living with your Dad?
29285,That was very kind of her.
29286,oh no! I bet your so sad right now. im sorry for your loss
29287,"I know it can be upsetting and sad, but take your time. It will be ok. "
29288,"That's awful, I'm sorry. Does she want to be with the other guy instead of you?"
29289,I hope it all works out with you and your girlfriend.
29290,Nice movie! I bet you had a fun and joyful time watching it. 
29291,Nice! How exciting. 
29292,Hey me too!  What are you working on?
29293,"No, I meant I hope you get the funding.  Sounds interesting!!"
29294,Yikes! Y'all need another new printer 
29295,That can be tough. I hope everything is okay.
29296,Good luck with it all.
29297,"Oh no!  I'm so sorry, we just went through that with our pup.  It's a hard choice to have to make."
29298,"I'm sorry you are having to make that choice, but I feel it's our duty to them to help them pass on when they are not going to get better and help them not suffer any longer."
29299,Me too. 
29300,"Once, but it burned the wall so my mom got rid of it"
29301,That's so sad. What do you think about that?
29302,"It might be best to send him then. On the bright side, you will still be able to visit him and I am sure he'll be taken care of very well."
29303,"I agree. Its frusterating, especially when it was an important conversation. "
29304,How annoying. Dont pay them now mind! do your own thing
29305,Yum! I have never had it. I bet you enjoyed it!
29306,Maybe I should try it out! It will be exciting to do so. 
29307,"Oh yeah, I can relate.  I always get uneasy before a big test.  And I always end up cramming and studying the last minute."
29308,"Well as long as you know the basic concepts and material and have it fresh in your mind for tomorrow, you should do fine.  I find I always worry and end up doing better than i expected."
29309,I cannot stand that!  Did this happen to you recently?
29310,Did you say anything to the waitress? I've always wanted to but never have.  My husband tells me not to say anything because then they will spit on my food.
29311,Beautiful! You must be so proud!
29312,That's such a great idea! Dance is a great exercise for kids.
29313,That's sounds like a lot of fun! What did you guys do?
29314,I am glad ya'll had a blast. It's always good to spend some quality time with the fam.
29315,Did you have fun there by yourself at least?
29316,You should have joined one of the other groupls and pretended to belong.  See who would've said something first.
29317,Me too! Gouda is my all time fav. What's yours?
29318,"Oh yeah, a good mozzarella sounds pretty primo right now. Perhaps I'll get some mozz sticks from Little Caesars."
29319,Whoo! What trick was it? How old is he?
29320,So cute! You must be so proud! You should teach him more tricks!
29321,Could there be a reason that he is?
29322,It must be frustrating! How are you gonna go about doing it?
29323,Fun! You guys got to spend a lot of time together?
29324,Did he pass? At least you got to appreciate him and show him your love
29325,I agree! How annoying that is!
29326,I was of been furious as well. How could they ruin a nice day!!
29327,Wow that is a long time. How did you keep it together that long?
29328,"I was hoping for an easier way, but I guess like all worthwhile things hard work is key"
29329,Oh what show?
29330,hm must've been a really controversial show.
29331,"Oh, me too! What do you love about it?"
29332,"If only it was Christmas all year long, hu?"
29333,How exciting!  What kind of restaurant to you want to open?
29334,"That sounds amazing! We need a Korean restaurant in our town, I would love for one to open here!"
29335,That's so sad. Did she live a happy and fulfilled life?
29336,That's so nice! Perhaps you should dwell on good memories like that of her to rid yourself of your sadness. We have to remember the good times with our loved ones!
29337,Oh I bet!  Did you take him outside?
29338,I use puppy pads in my house in case my dog needs to use the bathroom in the house.   Those seem to work pretty good!
29339,oh wow nice! its never too late.
29340,"makes me think, what am i doing to reach my goals today?!"
29341,That's great news! You must be excited!
29342,Oh gosh. Wonder why she won't be upfront about it.
29343,You must be so proud and happy! What a young athelete in the making
29344,Wow! Sounds like he was the MVP of the team!
29345,"Tornadoes can be so terrifying. My house was swept up by one when I was a little kid. But I guess it was okay, since I ended up meeting a talking scarecrow, a tin man, and a big ole lion."
29346,It is indeed! It was all swell and dandy until the darn flying monkeys swooped in. That really put a damper on things.
29347,Oh my! What did she do?
29348,"Wow, she sounds like an awful person. I feel bad for her son for not being able to get his car."
29349,I bet your excited about it!
29350,I bet you anticipate it to be good like usual!
29351,I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a similar place around you!
29352,How long have you been waiting for? Hang in there.
29353,"That's awesome. 1 year down. Keep at it, buddy."
29354,hahaha I have not heard that from many people.
29355,"I know! Then you get to the bowling alley, try to do what they do, end up getting 3 gutter balls in a row, and fall flat on your butt to boot!"
29356,"Me and you both, friend. We can always try and have a blast though! I'm sure if we keep at it we'll get a turkey in a century or two."
29357,"Ugh, are you nervous about it?"
29358,That's great to hear. Your confidence will no doubt help you tomorrow.
29359,How did that go? Studying is very important in order to do good. 
29360,How annoying that could be. She could have alittle more respect for you. 
29361,How frustrating! I hope you were able to study just a little though.  
29362,Im sorry man! stay optimistic! dont be sad about it. 
29363,You should definitely change roommates. I had been through such experience and know how more difficulty he can bring. Stay away from irresponsible people
29364,Don't get emotional with him and don't let anger to ruin your relationship with him. Just distance yourself from him. That is it
29365,That really stinks. Is there any way you'll be able to keep up with him to ease the sadness?
29366,"That's really rough, my friend. I am sure there must be other folks that you can befriend! There's plenty of nice and kind people in the world."
29367,Oh no I am so sorry to hear that! 
29368,I can't imagine how much that much hurt. I hope you can at least cherish the memories you had together.
29369,Nice! What so happens to be on the Master Chef's menu?
29370,That's sounds delicious. I am sure it'll be much better than whatever Pizza Hut can make!
29371,I would have been running away. What did you do?
29372,LOL....that trash would have been on the ground.
29373,Oh nice. What type of stuff does the store sell?
29374,That's cool. I like when stores are organized and not a chaotic mess!
29375,Did this happen recently?  Did you take it back and admit the error?
29376,"Well, you may want to think about admitting it to the store manager and paying for it.  Especially if it's bothering you this much, it's the ony way to resolve it."
29377,"That really sucks. Is it because your mom was in the hospital? I am a psychic, so I tend to know these things."
29378,I am so sorry for your loss. It seems that I have to re-calibrate my psychic abilities.
29379,Are you nervous about it? Hope it goes well.
29380,Well maybe you should start with a small slope and work your way up. Don't terrify yourself.
29381,"Oh man.  Now I am having images of the movie ""It"" in my head.  What did you do?"
29382,That is unusual behavior for a clown.  I would say you might want to call the authorities.  There has to be a law against a creepy clown stalker
29383,"Yeah, ice cream really hits the spot when you're tired.  Especially when it's hot in the summer time like this."
29384,When the sun is burning like this I'd like nothing more than to just lay under a soft serve machine and pull the handle.  Good times!
29385,Nice! I bet your are excited about this
29386,Nice. Its nice to know he is content with this decision. 
29387,Oh no! How boring. Could you call up a few buddies to hang out?
29388,I can agree. Dont be too down. Im sure you can find someting to keep you busy. 
29389,That's horrible. Were you able to get it up before it stained?
29390,"Yeah, one look at a cute face like that and it's hard to be mad."
29391,That sucks. Did you tell him to go back and get the other one?
29392,I would've taken that pizza out of the box and smack him upside the head with it. What a lousy guy!
29393,Oh no! Did your dog have to go really bad or what happened?
29394,Hopefully with enough training your puppy will let you know when she has to go. It takes time.
29395,I feel ya! Do you have any big plans?
29396,"Nice! I've been in San Diego for the past two weeks hitting up the beach. I wish I could go with ya, since my vacation is coming to an end!"
29397,Are you ready for it?
29398,Yeah I have faith in ya!!  Tear it up!
29399,That is amazing. What a lovely and caring partner you have. You must be a happy person. Was it for any special occasion or just a surprise gift?
29400,That is cute. You should also surprise your partner then with some adorable gift in return of this favor
29401,"That's good to hear, friend! I've been trying to work off my debt as well. Once it's done, I'm going to chop those things up."
29402,I hear you. That really helped me out a bunch too. It'll be so nice when we're both debt free!
29403,"You must be so proud, but what was it for?"
29404,He must have worked really hard and it paid off. Good for him.
29405,That would have been a pleasant surprise!!
29406,you got a special niece. So talented and Kind.
29407,Oh wow! I bet she and you are so excited about it!
29408,What a nice surprise that is! I bet you anticipate her to love it!
29409,That's awful. I hope you can find a new job.
29410,That a fart can hospitalize anyone is pretty impressive.  Did your story make the local news?
29411,"Oh no, do you think your teacher will find out?"
29412,"At least you have learned your lesson, I hope? "
29413,Did you have fun? It's always great to face your fears!
29414,"Yay! I always find myself really nervous before the ride, but once I'm off of it, I want to go again! "
29415,That sounds so embarrassing! Are you okay?
29416,I am glad you're okay and you laughed it off. Just be careful the next time!
29417,How exciting. What was it and did you cry?
29418,Now that is a very interesting first word.
29419,"Holy cow!  Why didn't he say Bernie Sanders ""match me""!?"
29420,"What really grinds your gears, friend? Rotten potatoes? Beverly hillbillies?"
29421,I hate mine too! I want to smash that thing with a sledgehammer!
29422,Oh no! Was your neighbor upset about it.I bet your embarrassed.
29423,I agree. You must find a way to preventthis so you dont get embarrassed again. 
29424,I am sure they were happy tears.  How long had it been?
29425,That is a long time.  I am sure you have a lot of catching up to do
29426,omg. Driving skills are going down nowadays. You must very angry about it
29427,You should have chased him and must give your piece of mind
29428,Oh me TOO!!!!  That and Hee Haw both!  How did you cope?
29429,Oh man.  So the cancellation of Beverly Hillbillies took a toll on your health?
29430,Oh wow! Sounds like a wonderful time. Which one you taking them to?
29431,"Whatever they preach on Beverly Hillbillies is the law of nature. If they were afraid of coasters, I would be too. Tread lightly, friend."
29432,Nice! Where are you going to do it?
29433,"I am sure you will too. When I did, I thought I was on top of a mountain! (but I really wasn't because I was plummeting towards the earth)"
29434,Wow you must be so happy about it. 
29435,"Anyway, you got it now. I so happy for it. Next you need take a precaution"
29436,Oh no! I bet your disappointed in his actions!
29437,Im sorry about that. Im sure hes embarrassed about. I would be furious!
29438,Good Job to her! I bet you were so proud of her!
29439,Thats so good.I bet your overjoyed about it
29440,That is never good.  Did you go out and check on it?
29441,At least you will have a fun story to tell at parties.
29442,Oh nice!  Did you have fun?  Did you finally jump?
29443,haha.  I would've passed out and never woke up!  Silly me!
29444,Do you like toads?
29445,"That was nice of your girlfriend, do you love her?"
29446,That's nice. What color did you paint it?
29447,Those are swell colors! I am sure they will bring any guests much joy and merriment.
29448,"That's disappointing. I'm glad that you didn't let that stop you, and that you still went out and had a good time!"
29449,Why weren't your friends able to come?
29450,"Wow, that's kinda mean"
29451,You think he will be there next time so you can help him?
29452,"haha, was that intentional to get revenge on him/her. or just that you were hungry?"
29453,haha. Did you tell him about it?
29454,Very nice. I bet you were full of joy to see them.
29455,I bet they are very sentimental to you. Being able to remember those days must feel good
29456,Very sweet of him. Did he surprise you?
29457,Nice! Hes a sweet kid. I bet that brought you joy as well.
29458,"That is good, maybe you can get a raise."
29459,Will you work there forever?
29460,"Ah that sucks, you were going for any business meeting?"
29461,i hope you didn't lose that client
29462,"Oh wow, that's not good at all"
29463,"Yeah, that sounds no good, what will you do now?"
29464,"wow, you must have been out of this world"
29465,Only woman knows the hardship and endurance of pregnancy. I am happy for you
29466,How nostalgic! Was there anything in there that surprised you?
29467,That's so cute. How old were you?
29468,What is going on this weekend?
29469,Are you driving with anyone?
29470,Uh oh.  Better go back and get it!
29471,Oh dang.  Thats awful.  Maybe someone will let you borrow some?
29472,That's awful. Did you confront him?
29473,Is it your first date with her?
29474,Where are you taking her?
29475,That's exciting! What do you plan to do with it?
29476,Wonderful! Where are you going to go?
29477,Are you looking forward to an event happening then?
29478,Awesome! That should be a lot of fun!
29479,"That is great, how long have you been married?"
29480,Third is very good! What kind of race?
29481,Oh wow! Do you do a lot of marathons?
29482,Hey you should give that back
29483,Hey you should give the money back
29484,Did you take a photo of them?
29485,"Keep trying, never give up."
29486,Maybe you should go to a temp agency.
29487,I am so sorry to hear that. How long have you had him?
29488,"You must have developed strong attachments to him over all these years. To be honest, I am not an animal lover individual"
29489,I know exactly what you mean. It's really tough but when I make decisions I try to stand on them and be willing to pivot if necessary.
29490,That sounds right to me. I actually have a few people around me that give me straight forward advice like that.
29491,Sometimes it can be true. Don't be taken for a run 
29492,I hope that everything turns out the best for you too! 
29493,"Congratulations, that sounds like things are moving along at a nice pace."
29494,"That's understandable, I'm sure it will be exciting to customize and furnish your space."
29495,How long has it been since you had your old dog?
29496,It might take a bit of time to get back into the swing of owning a dog. I'm sure you'll be ready soon if you still think it over.
29497,"I lost my job, so I know how you feel. It is tough not have a source of income. "
29498,"Sometimes you got to just do it and hope and pray all comes out like it should, and it usually does. "
29499,It's never to late to continue on that path or find a new one. Same happened here.
29500,I always try to remind myself. Tomorrow is a new day. What do you want to do with yours?
29501,"That's terrible. I don't know what's up with this world anymore, it seems like things are always getting worse."
29502,"Well if they were family heirloom or photographs, I don't really think the money would have been important. The family passes down antiques and precious items for keeping."
29503,Have you tried talking to them about this? 
29504,"That's really frustrating, they'll realize only when you start distancing yourself from them"
29505,Did you hear anything about what happened at that camp in your absence? I hope there were no hard feelings!
29506,"Sorry for the delay. I had a technical difficulty. Either way, I'm sure there were no hard feelings. A lot of people sign up to work those camps every year."
29507,That's completely understandable. Have you tried distracting yourself with hobbies or productive chores?
29508,That's the best thing you can do really. I hope she comes back soon for your sake!
29509,"Any ice cream on sale sounds like a good time to me. I've never heard of Blue Bell though, is it any good?"
29510,I'll need to find some and give it a taste myself! That sounds awesome.
29511,"Oh no, that's such an awful thing for them to do. Do your cats often ruin things in the household?"
29512,Oh odd. That's a good way to look at it though; too many people get too angry with their pets over these type of things.
29513,And is he okay with that?
29514,"I suppose that makes sense. As long as both of you are happy with your relationship dynamic, that's all that counts!"
29515,What happened to yours?
29516,"That is a real shame, at least you can hold on to your memories."
29517,Dang that's a definite mood killer. At least you've got a fix on the way.
29518,One can only hope!
29519,Well from what i have read we will all be drowning which isn't good.
29520,Yeah forest fires are getting really bad.
29521,Odd! Any idea where you went wrong?
29522,Practice definitely makes perfect!
29523,"Soon they will be leaving the nest, hey?"
29524,I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you better now?
29525,"I hope it is nor Samonella, just a temporarily bug."
29526,"You guys sound like great grand kids, I bet she wholeheartedly appreciated it."
29527,I bet you guys were close and this certainly brought you all closer together. I'm so happy that you had these connections with your family.
29528,Sounds like fun!  Did you enjoyed it? How far did you go?
29529,Great! love road trips!  I hope to take one soon.
29530,Why has your week been so busy?
29531,Do you know what movie you plan on watching?
29532,yikes! That must have caught you off guard.
29533,Murphy's law i suppose. I'm sure it wasn't so bad though in the end.
29534,Oh no! Did he take it okay?
29535,That's sweet that you guys are able to let the small things go. It sounds like you have a great relationship.
29536,I'm in the same boat. I'm so happy to hear that and I hope you get the job!
29537,Companies that pay their workers well equals happy workers!
29538,Are you excited for the new group?
29539,"Well, I hope it goes well!"
29540,Must be hard when you can't physically see what you are doing.
29541,Yeah YouTube is a good source of information.
29542,Oh no that sucks! What book?
29543,"Ah I've never read it before, I was hoping it would have been one I'm familiar with."
29544,Oh the nostalgia of watching old movies. What movie?
29545,Unfortunately I've never heard of it!
29546,I used to want to do that so bad when I was younger. Was it amazing?
29547,That's so awesome. I don't think I would have the courage now. Will you do it again?
29548,That's a great goal to set for yourself. Where do you work if I may ask?
29549,Sounds important. I hope you're able to meet your goal!
29550,"It must be nice to have that kind of trust for someone, and motorcycles can be fun!"
29551,"Awesome. I've only rode dirt bikes personally, but i definitely see the appeal. "
29552,"Aw, I've been there, I bet you like it!  Especially after you get used to it."
29553,That is such a great attitude!
29554,That's terrifying! I bet you didn't sleep that night!
29555,"HA! Are you a fan of horror movies now, or do you still find them scary?"
29556,"Yeah, me either, although there have been some good ones lately. Better stories, more plot. "
29557,"I am sorry to hear that,  I hope it is only a temporarily situation and you will be on your feet in no time."
29558,"Yes I know.  It hasn't been easy for me either, but I believe think will go our way pretty soon."
29559,Wow that's so exciting! I bet he's a nice guy in real life. 
29560,Cool! That's so neat. 
29561,"Oh no. Maybe you can find one that is used, or even rebuilt. I got my car for 75% less than what I would've paid from a car dealer!"
29562,"Well, stick through it! I wish you luck :) "
29563,"Oh, I could do that if I didn't have bad teeth and can't handle the cold. I would regret it if I did though because I really need to lose some weight."
29564,"Lol, burn those calories. Hope you have a high metabolism."
29565,"Well, you gave him the benefit of the doubt. It was his decision to cheat. "
29566,Now you have more information to base your next decision on. You live you learn.
29567,That's kind of him! Is he good at that sort of thing?
29568,Yes you'd have more warranty kind of things with work from a dealership
29569,That's awesome! I wish someone in my family was so handy!
29570,Wow! Maybe you should take uncle out for dinner! LOL
29571,Me too. Old photos bring about such nostalgia.
29572,"I can only imagine! When my parents open old photo albums of my siblings and I, they get teary-eyed."
29573,"Wow, that's such an honor.  How do you feel about it?"
29574,I'd be very nervous too.  I get stage fright.
29575,I bet that whipped up a lot of feelings inside of you. I'm sorry for your loss.
29576,That's great. It's just as good to remember the great times you spent together as it is to grieve.
29577,Get away with what?
29578,Did you get caught using them?!
29579,Wow! That's terrible! Maybe next time just get a tutor instead of cheating!
29580,Sorry this happened!
29581,Oh dear! What happened!?
29582,Oh my goodness! Good for you for getting away from that trouble!
29583,Next day guilt when the fun is done. How awful. I wonder if they'll fess up.
29584,Yikes. I'm glad you're not mixed up in that!
29585,How did that go? Do you like that? 
29586,Oh no! Really? Were they upset?
29587,Who was it with?
29588,Were you more mad at them or your spouse?
29589,What was it?  Did everything turn out alright?
29590,Phew! I'm glad that's all it was.
29591,That's terrible when friends fight. What was it over?
29592,That's got to be a tough phone call to make. Did you two make amends or is she very upset?
29593,Uh oh don't want to be that kid that's for sure!
29594,How interesting.  How does that make you feel?
29595,"Yes, I think that would be a little surreal, and I might feel ambivalent about it."
29596,"I felt the same way as you, but what's the point of keeping things you don't use and having it take up space? Do you use everything in your closet? "
29597,"So the items are sentimental to you? I know how hard it is to part with items that have memories behind them, but at the end of the day, they are just items! :)"
29598,Oh how sweet! What did it say?
29599,I love finding treasures like that! 
29600,I hope that I am able to share such nice things with my own kids one day.
29601,I really enjoy that too!
29602,That is a lot of work! But I bet the reunion will be fun. 
29603,"Yum, I love making and also eating desserts! Do you have a specialty?"
29604,Oh that's one of my faves. My go to is cheesecake. 
29605,It's a crowd pleaser. I love the dips and apps at get togethers like that. 
29606,Is that like hospice care? How do you deal with seeing loss so frequently?
29607,I'm sure you do a great job of making these people feel cared for and loved in their final times.
29608,I bet it is. Thank you for giving your time to this type of work.
29609,You deserve them! That's excellent to hear.
29610,Oh no! I hate when I'm hungry for something and it goes wrong like that!
29611,The worst! Did you find something else to eat?
29612,Better than nothing but still no patty melt!
29613,That's exciting. Is that something you want to do?
29614,That could definitely be tough. Especially with a baby.
29615,"Really, did you get to pick the movie?"
29616,Oh wow thats always nice when everyone can agree on the same movie.
29617,"That's always nice, how did you respond?"
29618,"That's cool, nothing wrong with being faithful. "
29619,"Nice, jobs are ok, but a new ride is really fun. What did you get"
29620,Toyota's usually last a long time so it might be a good decision.
29621,"Wow, was it embarrassing?"
29622,Dang! Well at least you got a good story to tell now!
29623,"oh really, hopefully its a pretty nice job cause moving is not fun."
29624,Well at least you get to be with the man you love...hopefully
29625,As long as you're safe about it. You can meet up at police stations too! 
29626,More people are open and into it so yo ucan always talk to your police about it
29627,Wow. That's a long time. Longer than I've been alive! Congrats on your successful marriage. Got any tips?
29628,Thanks for the advice. I have trouble letting the petty things go but I think I'll learn to be better as time goes by. I wish you a happy marriage! 
29629,"Ohhhh, that's so sad. I remember (long ago) when that happened to me. Did he/she live a good long life?"
29630,"Yeah, that is a shame. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I know how important a great teacher can be your life."
29631,Are you nervous? Or do you have amazing confidence in your ability?
29632,Do make sure to get a good nights sleep before hand. That is just as important.
29633,How old is your son?
29634,I can understand why you felt so nervous. A mothers attachment is rather strong to a newborn. You should get him a gaurd dog when he's a bit older if you still feel that way.
29635,Wow! I enjoy watching Overwatch on Twitch occasionally. Would you say that's your favorite game?
29636,I never got into COD and I tried Overwatch when it first came out but I wasn't very good. Fortnite on the other hand I'm alright at. 
29637,That's awesome! What did you have done?
29638,"I can imagine. Things like are always so stressful, but so nice once they are completed."
29639,Make sure to bring smores and bug spray. I hate bug bites. and love chocolate 
29640,Make sure you bring something to drink as well. can get quite thirsty ya know.
29641,Oh I feel you! Every time I go back to stay with my family it feels... claustrophobic almost.
29642,"I'm sure they are! Itll feel more normal soon, I am sure"
29643,What's wrong with your tooth? I hope it's not too painful of an experience.
29644,Yikes! I've had that before. My thoughts are with you. I'm sure the dentist will take care of it though.
29645,That's awful.  What are you going to do?
29646,Interest are you going to try and get him to sell it?
29647,"That will be fun, maybe he will even let you play his xbox on it."
29648,Same. When you had one phone in the middle of the house with the SUPER long phone cord so you could at least get around the corner to talk.
29649,"I agree. The convenience is nice now, but the quality is much lower."
29650,Were you close to your wife's grandmother?
29651,That is very heartbreaking. Im sure she had a very positive opinion of you as well.
29652,Im sure your wife also appreciates you getting along with her family.
29653,Those times seemed much simpler didn't they? Do you ever break out of the routine?
29654,I see. How do you like playing the piano?
29655,That's the spirit. I bet you're a wonderful pianist.
29656,Awesome! Anything exciting on the horizon to treat yourself?
29657,What's the one you are most excited about?
29658,Well that stinks.  What are they drilling for?
29659,Are they almost done with it?
29660,That is sad.  I am sure you can come up with a good career.  What do you like to do?
29661,That's exciting and nerve wracking at the same time I bet. How do you feel about it?
29662,For sure. Well good luck! Nurses are very under-appreciated. I hope you get.
29663,that can be tough but it also can be great to have time for yourself
29664,i can see where isolation can be overwhelming and the need for social contact is desirable and needed
29665,Oh that's exciting. Are you nervous to have them over?
29666,I bet it's all in your head. I am sure it will all good smooth.
29667,Aww that's so cute! Was it tough trying to get it to swim?
29668,Proud of the little pup!
29669,That's so creepy and scary. What happened next?
29670,Why are there so many weirdos in this world? I'm glad you made it out safe.
29671,What for? I hope it wasn't for anything dangerous.
29672,"That's a little dangerous. I'd definitely talk to her about why you didn't allow her to go to that party, and maybe she'll realize that what you're doing is for her own good."
29673,Yes I understand!  It is so hard to lose weight!
29674,Yes.  Chocolate is my nemesis.  I think it is more addicting than cocaine
29675,"Ouch, that's unfortunate. Hopefully it turned out okay though?"
29676,"I can imagine, talk about bad timing injuring your toes!"
29677,Oh no! Did you get in trouble?
29678,Good for you for standing up for your little brother. hope the kid is ok though.
29679,Sometimes when you are looking back at a situation you get a whole new perspective now that you're away from it. I'm happy that you have that realization.
29680,Are they gone now or is a reunion possible?
29681,God's Plan! Do you know why he did it?
29682,"Dang, I wish I could have it happen to me someday!"
29683,That's great!  Such a satisfying feeling!  Did you get a good grade?
29684,I hope you were really proud of yourself :-)
29685,That's really good news. It must be frustrating to move from place to place constantly. Is your family happy with the place?
29686,I hope you and your family enjoy the new home.
29687,Amen. What kind of dogs do yo have?
29688,Aw little guys. Do they walk well on the leash?
29689,That's about how mine is. He is a bit bigger so he pulls a little harder. I found using a harness has helped.
29690,He is a mix breed. We don't really know.
29691,That sounds great! Are you excited?
29692,I hope you accomplish everything!
29693,Oh my goodness. That must have been traumatic to see. Do you know what happened to the dog?
29694,"Well, I'm sorry you had to see that!"
29695,I agree with that. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt at first.
29696,Oh man. Bless your soul! I bet that can test your patience.
29697,Im sure it can be highly rewarding too.
29698,I'm glad it's over and nothing happened. do you have an underground shelter?
29699,"Oh, I would be scared too. apartments seem safe unless the roof gets ripped of of coarse."
29700,I hope you do it!
29701,congratulations! that is exciting. How long have you been waiting for this.
29702,Very cool. I wish you all the best.
29703,I'm a freelancer
29704,started out slow but now it is!
29705,Oh no! Not the old pop on the rug trick. Did you yell?
29706,What kind of dog? I have a boston terrier. She's the cutest. 
29707,Oh cute! What a devil. 
29708,"Mine too. Can't help it, those eyes!"
29709,Oh no! Did you have to go home and change?
29710,What a bummer! Sorry to hear that. 
29711,That is so cool! Im not married yet
29712,"Maybe, im not sure yet"
29713,Aw that's tough!  Have you talked to him about it?
29714,It might have upset him but I'm sure he'll understand!  Everyone loses their temper sometimes and it's not like you didn't have a legit reason
29715,I hope it's a lot more than just a gift card but at least Starbucks should be a lot of money because it's so expensive there!
29716,oh yes then you need much more than a starbucks gift card!  good luck!!
29717,I am sorry that must have been tough.  She probably felt bad for you.
29718,That is great because friendships are very important
29719,"Ok,thats lovely"
29720,Its shows a lot of care
29721,"A point of what? Like, of land?"
29722,Oh boy. I'm not sure where you'd find one. That's pretty old fashioned. Did you find one?
29723,Oh no! That must have put you in a bad position. How did you handle it?
29724,Sounds like a great way of handling a potentially sticky situation - good job!
29725,hi friend who is too good to you?
29726,that's good though! I bet you're grateful.
29727,Thats so cool of you
29728,"Yea,thats the right thing to do"
29729,I know! That must be frustrating. Do you have enough money to cover it?
29730,Oh wow... it seems like bad things always hit at once like that. Hang in there - I hope it will get better for you!
29731,I'm sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger! 
29732,Oh that's so great - and now you can feel comfortable leaving them with her more often!
29733,"It does sound like fun, though. Did you have a good time?"
29734,Are you ever going to do it again or are you done? I went when I was a child. 
29735,True. Easier said than done though. How can we be?
29736,Definetly! it starts with a single person right
29737,Did  you layer had the surgery?
29738,"Oh,congrats dear"
29739,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! That must have been upsetting."
29740,Then you must have felt relief.
29741,"oh I am so sorry, I am assuming the injury was serious?"
29742,oh man I hope you got a second opinion? I would be so worried about your injury. I am so sorry.
29743,Hasn't everyone done so at some point?
29744,"Atleast it wasn't in class at a college or something, right?"
29745,"I wouldn't sweat it, chances are you won't see any of those people again right? Even if you do, it's unlikely they'll remember you let alone your smelly fart."
29746,oh my gosh that's so cute! I bet they were the cutest.
29747,"I'm sure it does, I don't have any of my own but I would be really sentimental."
29748,"Yes, but think of all the opportunities it can open up. Don't let fear stop you!"
29749,"I know, but I'm sure you'll do great! I went to school for many years through a Master's degree, and although it was hard, it was worth it. "
29750,Did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in?
29751,Be happy that you were able to spend some time with her and sharing personal time with her by helping her with her homework. Not many parents do that for their children
29752,oh no! I bet you were so mad! were you able to find something else to snack on?
29753,That is heartbreaking. That sounds really good. Never purchased one of those.
29754,I am completely agree.  How long have you been married?
29755,Constant work and attention is key to a great relationship!
29756,That sucks.  I hate having scratched glasses
29757,Yes and it always bothers me looking through scatches.
29758,I'm so sorry to hear that. I was together with my wife for 7 years when she left me so I know your pain.
29759,It takes awhile for it to be over. Find a hobby to take your mind off of it. It helps to ease the pain.
29760,"yes, that is always a hard situation.  "
29761,oh man that is horrible!  I am so sorry
29762,"That's the best decision. I know mine wouldn't either. If he is a good guy, he will understand."
29763,That's good. No sense in rocking the boat.
29764,It is definitely good to get that looked at right away. Then they can take care of it!
29765,Oh I know it's hard. Just try to relax and it will go quick. 
29766,Nice! Did it help you become less stressed?
29767,"Dang, well I hope you can continue your goal of meditating every day!"
29768,Scared of what
29769,"Oh,dont mind me,just been curious"
29770,"I feel that, plus it's nice not to have to worry about returning it."
29771,Oh thats not good..sometimes teenagers can be alittle messy
29772,Well I am sure he will get better with age
29773,I think theme park rides are scary! Was it scary when you were stuck?
29774,They are really good about that. They have a lot of safety features you don't even realize. We were stuck on Space Mountain once. 
29775,"Awww, you're speaking fondly on when he was young. Is he not as nice anymore?"
29776,"That's depressing to here. I have family members who are still cool now as well, but I just think so fondly on when they were younger. They grow up too fast, and it really is amazing when they're young and innocent and haven't been exposed to the real world yet."
29777,"I suppose, but research and concrete knowledge is more beneficial as it is a very hands on and physical occupation, especially when the health of others are in their hands."
29778,That is true. There are many situations where experience can strengthen your skills compared to just learning it from a book.
29779,Dogs are wonderful pets. They are so loving and devoted. What kind of dog do you have?
29780,"That's an awesome name. I have two feists. If you're not familiar with the breed, they resemble Jack Russell terriers, but they are bred for squirrel hunting. Their names are Whiskey and Ruby."
29781,all the time I am not sure I believe in God
29782,that's pretty crazy you could of had your money and the care package too
29783,yeah I understand what you mean definitely
29784,"Oh, I am so sorry! I am an animal lover, too. We have two dogs now, but used to have cats, too. We did have to say goodbyes to some of our pets over years. It's heart breaking..."
29785,How long did you have your cat?
29786,Was it a holiday?
29787,It sounds like a fun event.
29788,Oh no! That is so frustrating.
29789,That is good that you are a nice friend to her. 
29790,I am sure you were.  Was boot camp really hard
29791,I could never do something like that.  Thank you for your service
29792,Oh wow. I would hate that. What ended up being the issue?
29793,Maybe he has forgotten how it feels to randomly be called into your bosses office. He's moved on up.
29794,Oh no -- how is she feeling now?
29795,"Yeah, that had to be tough. I'm glad she's doing better now though. "
29796,What a bummer! What place did you end up getting?
29797,I know the feeling. You work so hard just to feel crushed.
29798,Did you get hurt or drown a bit?
29799,"Nice, well hopefully nothing like that ever happens again!"
29800,I sure hope the hot dog was fit to eat 
29801,"Oh, you shouldn't feel bad about it, i'm sure it was fine to eat!"
29802,That's really good you guys can trust eachother like that. That helps make you both grow in the relationship.
29803,Wow! You don't see much of that anymore. So true.
29804,"Yes, I am a product of a broken marriage. My children are too. Keep up the good work you guys!"
29805,Where were you not invited to?
29806,You were not invited?! That's awful. How close are you to your friend?
29807,"Hey,were you injured?"
29808,Hope they took it easy with you?
29809,Aww that is so sweet.  I completely understand why!  Oh and thank you for your apology but I am truly content and have accepted it.
29810,Men are crazy sometimes!  LOL!
29811,Sounds like a fun one to me. Are you happy there?
29812,I agree. Im sure you get bored or lonely while traveling too. 
29813,who is that?
29814,sometimes we have to learn how to not be jealous of things
29815,Thats always a good feeling. I bet you are excited to come home everyday.
29816,What a good dog and full of joy!
29817,I bet she loves you just at much as you love her.
29818,I hope you have a good time and you enjoy it.
29819,"I bet, everyone should take time out yo enjoy life every once in awhile."
29820,Did you do it? How far does he live from you?
29821,Oh no! Was he mad?
29822,What happend?
29823,What is a hot slap? Sounds painful!
29824,"They haven't called you back yet? I hate when that happens, they make you wait by the phone on pins and needles!"
29825,"Don't let it break your confidence though, it just wasn't meant to be. I think you'll land your next application though."
29826,Uncertainty can be so agonizing. Just keep your head up though!
29827,Oh my gosh! Have they broken it? That would drive me nuts.
29828,Have you spoken to them personally? Maybe they should pay for you to move it!
29829,Wow. I'm so sorry. Maybe you could put concrete around it so it damages their car? lol
29830,"Wow that sounds intriguing, what new things did you try?"
29831,"That's awesome, cows are amazing"
29832,"Yeah, it's crazy how each year seems to go by faster than the last too, having kids must be surreal"
29833,"Me too, it's like you realize more and more that all you have is the present moment."
29834,"Wow, congrats, what did you end up naming him?"
29835,"You are lucky, and I am sure he will be tons of work but it will be worth it."
29836,sounds exciting. I always wanted to leave my were I was originally from so I could experience and see new things
29837,"No, but i hope things work out for you in this new part of your life."
29838,Oh definitely. Why did you?
29839,I can. I'm so sorry. Was it something really bad? Or were you able to move on from it?
29840,It's always fun to get new clothes! Is the wedding soon?
29841,"I'm not very fashionable, but I do have some t-shirts that I love to wear because they fit me really well."
29842,Sounds like a real hard decision. I would be very apprehensive as well.
29843,You sound so excited about it and your future there. I would be full of joy as well.
29844,That sounds like some good work experience. How long is he in.
29845,"Well, hopefully he is as good as Sherlock Holmes and saves some lives."
29846,That's the worst. I wonder if he was trying to prove something.
29847,Good! I don't know why people think they can get away with things like that.
29848,"congrats, how did you handle the pressure?"
29849,"It can be pretty nerve racking, but it is always great practice. You will only get better."
29850,OMG! especially recently. a week seems like one day.
29851,That's so true. My daughter moved out this year and I'm wondering where the heck the time went!
29852,Oh really? Are you a massage therapist?
29853,Wow congratulations! You must be so excited!
29854,"I'm good, what's up?"
29855,"Yeah, that must be difficult"
29856,Way to go! If it makes you feel better I would be your friend if I was there
29857,"I used to, but yeah especially if you're not in school"
29858,Hope you didn't take a bath after that
29859,Minus one for cats
29860,Wow Brazil? Isn't there a lot of crime there?
29861,"What is she going to do there, sounds kind of dangerous."
29862,"That's good, how does that make you feel"
29863,"Nice, I like your attitude"
29864,"Nice, too bad I wasn't invited!"
29865,Sounds fun! Keep fighting the good fight lol
29866,No! I think that should be on my bucket list though.
29867,I bet that would be cool. I've watched on Tv. They know what their doing.
29868,What are you waiting for?
29869,Oh I totally know how that goes. I moved to small town and didn't have many friends at first. Once I had my son and made more friends it got way better lol!
29870,"Thanks, you as well. I know how that is. give it time and things will get better."
29871,"Yeah, I think it gets more difficult as you get older anyway."
29872,"Aw, I know how that goes. Do they visit often?"
29873,Wow that's sad. I'm sorry.
29874,That does sound exciting! Why are you scared?
29875,"Oh, that is definitely a change! But at least you can still keep in touch nowadays."
29876,"Yeah I have one, but they're all over the place it seems like"
29877,"That's funny, just don't let it in your room while your sleeping!"
29878,Babies are pretty small and delicate they look like they might break at the slightest bump.
29879,"It's a pretty small percentage, but it would definitely be something to worry about."
29880,Wow that would be terrible news. I can't imaged shit is taking it well.
29881,Hopefully she has a supportive partner to help her as well. Glad you are there to help her.
29882,"That is horrible, I am so sorry, It is hard losing a baby animal, you are not expecting them to pass, like when you have an older sickly one"
29883,"That is crazy, I wonder what was wrong with it"
29884,"Wow, I never knew cats could even get an aneurysm, but I guess like humans why wouldn't they be able to?"
29885,Ahhhh thats amazing! I stay home with my kids too! How many kids do you have?
29886,"It definitely can be a challenge. I have a 10 year old boy, an 8 year old girl, and a 2 year old girl. I love being home with them."
29887,"Oh no, what happened? Did they do or say something?"
29888,"Oh girl, that happens to me all the time too. So frustrating, just leave us alone."
29889,"I'm sorry, is it difficult to take care of her?"
29890,"Dang, I hope everything turns out okay for you guys"
29891,"Hmm, how did that make you feel"
29892,"Yeah, at least now you're more aware, it can be pretty tough when you're trying to break the habit though"
29893,Good to hear that you keep your word
29894,Keep it up brochacho
29895,At least that shows that you have a conscience. I hope that you made it up to them.
29896,Confess to them what happened. Let them know how you have changed.
29897,"Wow, I am sure the Veterans loved it! What kind of treats did you and the kids bring to them?"
29898,So thoughtful of you! What did the kids think of visiting the veterans?
29899,Wow that is some really early christmas shopping. you must like to plan ahead.
29900,Yeah spending money on things is always a temporary high.
29901,I love vegetable soup. So were you able to enjoy your nap ?
29902,Well I'm happy for you. Its hard to catch a nap around here sometimes.
29903,Sounds like she has some underlying issues with trust. You may want to sort it all out before you get too involved.
29904,Maybe you couldn't but it sounds like something is going on with her. 
29905,That was nice of them. Did you have any problems with their car?
29906,THat is good to hear. What happened to your own car?
29907,Well at least you can trust him to be careful.  I dont think I would be able to trust my nephew as he is only 18 and not very responsible yet.
29908,Yes its amazing how much of  a difference a few years can make in age.  It seems that males take quite awile long to mature than females.   
29909,"That's so nice of you, I would have chased down the car, but you did the right thing"
29910,"Feels bad, hope you have someone to talk about it with!"
29911,What kind of job is it?   I will keep my fingers crossed he gets it!
29912,"THats awesome, does it pay better than the one he has?  A pay increase is certainly helpful."
29913,"oh wow i am glad she was happy, why were you nervous?"
29914,"oh don't be, you should be happy for her, there will come a time where you will get something back in return :)"
29915,Boy o-boy bet she is having the time of her life. How many vacations have you taken this year?
29916,"Me too, maybe our wish will come true only time will tell."
29917,"Oh, no! What happened?"
29918,Oh wow! That's like the worst nightmare! I'm so sorry that happened to you!!
29919,Were you able to get out of there without anybody noticing or did you die from embarssment?
29920,I'm sure that was not a fun ride home. 
29921,where you disappointed? 
29922,I remember the same thing. And the joy that followed for the next moth was pure bliss
29923,"Alright, so do you ever have to evacuate?"
29924,maybe go earlier later?
29925,"oh, that's kind of weird"
29926,"... im sorry, how did it happen"
29927,"that sucks, but hey man it's okay one day you'll find right person "
29928,Nice! The married life is expensive
29929,I hope you two have a nice future. At least you know the family will support you!
29930,Oh! What happened?
29931,Wow! You lazy bum. You disappointed me too!
29932,That sounds awful. Who was it you wronged?
29933,Was she understanding and forgiving?
29934,I'm sure you will be able to get another one fairly quickly!
29935,"I hope that you see amazing results, and you continue to enjoy yourself!"
29936,Do you think it's possible that he does still love you and also made a horrible mistake?
29937,"I think that when people cheat and lie, it's because something is wrong with them and not their partner.  If he doesn't realize his mistake, then he doesn't deserve your love.  I wish you all the best!"
29938,"I hope you realize your worth too. I do this thing where I think about another woman in my life who I really care about (mom, daughter, etc.) and I think ""if this was happening to them, what kind of advice would I give them?""  Sometimes, we think we deserve less."
29939,what do you mean?
29940,"oh, what happend"
29941,"yes i do, that's why i only trust one person, my wife"
29942,"im sorry, what did happend next? how does that make you feel?"
29943,That's horrible! Did you have any sort of tracker on it?
29944,"Awwe that is so sweet, how did you two meet? "
29945,Wow that sounds like a really big journey. It must have been really hard to connect with one another only through online chats.
29946,Mmm that sounds delicious. There is always time to make pancake Tuesdays at home!
29947,"I see, memories will always stay, sometimes good old days just can't come back."
29948,"I haven't, but it's definitely on my bucket list!"
29949,I bet it helped having someone there who knew what they were doing. 
29950,I have a friend who recently became certified as an instructor. He jumps almost every weekend. He will be taking me when I go!
29951,I believe I was fifteen. I drove a soccer mom van!
29952,Did you ever get caught?!
29953,Oh no! I would have been furious! Were you able to catch him?
29954,Oh im so sorry! I bet your are devestated! I would be tool.
29955,Oh okay.... was that even a temptation to begin with?
29956,"Alrighty then, just seemed like a really weird thing to say. "
29957,Oh no that is awful! It is against the law where I live to ban animals from the house. So legally I am allowed to have a pet even if the contract says no pets allowed. 
29958,Canada! You should check the laws in your area to see whether or not you are legally allowed to have a pet even if the land lords do not approve.
29959,"I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope she'll be doing good, she is very lucky to have someone taking care of her."
29960,"You must have a very good connection, that's beautiful."
29961,Oh no! Hopefully you didn't get too many nasty stares!
29962,"Oh well, accidents happen!"
29963,I've had a similar experience with a gossiping coworker. It made the workplace such an uncomfortable environment!
29964,It's a good lesson to learn! Don't worry about it too much. I am sure that the truth will surface eventually.
29965,"wow that sure is a lot of stuffed animals, did you play with toys alot at a kid?"
29966,what kind of interests?
29967,That's very exciting! I'm sure he put a lot of work towards that.
29968,All the work paid off!
29969,did  you end up ending the friendship?
29970,you didn't let anything affect the friendship! that's good i am proud of you
29971,Oh that is definitely something to be excited about!
29972,That is quite unique. I'm happy to hear that!
29973,"that must have been so painful, don't get embarrassed it happens to everyone, people fart in public transports, people fall and rip their jeans, people cry over stupid things, it's a totally normal thing "
29974,"you sure will, besides hot jocks doesn't sound too bad too me :3"
29975,Was that your idea? Why did you decide to do that?
29976,You must really trust her to let her hold on to your life's savings!
29977,My condolences to you. Will you be able to visit his gravesite?
29978,"Yes, it will be worth saving up for. I hope it works out for you."
29979,I hope that nothing came of it though.
29980,I'm sure nothing happened! Gotta have some trust.
29981,Great confidence! what do you anticipate your grade to be
29982,You prepared well! You will do goo.
29983,That's great! good luck
29984,I can agree with that
29985,I a so sorry to hear that. How are you coping with your loss? 
29986,"Yes, sometimes that is the only thing you can do. I hope you are also getting some support from family and other friends "
29987,You sound prepared for it! Im sure you have practiced.
29988,Very nice! Keep the confidence and dont doubt yourself tomorrow.
29989,Hey what is up? 
29990,"Oh, no want to talk about it?"
29991,"Oh no, that's terrible, what are you going to do?"
29992,"Well that's no good, you could try taping it back together"
29993,That's great I always love to hear about happy couples. Too much bad news in the world.
29994,"Oh, eats lots of cake and make sure to have a nice dinner with candles. Maybe a bubble bath too."
29995,"Hi there, how're you?"
29996,"I'm doing well. It's quite early in the morning though, that's for sure."
29997,I know the feeling When you finally have your own place to do what you want.  
29998,Good or bad I have been in that situation many times.  More recently when I was separated from my current wife.  My own place.  Finally!
29999,why? what did he do?
30000,"oh i know this feeling, but don't worry it's okay! these things happen, soon feeling will disappear "
30001,I hope you do too. Sounds like you did well preparing. 
30002,Very good! I anticipate you will get in!
30003,Is your dog ok?
30004,Does your sister usually have problems?
30005,That sounds like the worst feeling.
30006,"ah i know this feeling, how did the conversation go?"
30007,"it's okay, next just tell them that you didn't quiet understand what they meant and so they will explain it again"
30008,"You shouldn't be so attached to your old stuff, you might end up a hoarder!"
30009,Well that is a good reason to keep holding on to something!
30010,Oh no. Did you study for it?
30011,I hope it goes better than you expect! Cram all that information into your brain!
30012,"What makes you so afraid of them? They do eat all the other creepy-crawlies, after all. "
30013,"True, they aren't a very visually appealing species. But at least they're more afraid of you, that's some consolation. "
30014,Oh no how did you feel?
30015,"I totally understand that feeling and know what you mean! But I wouldn't sweat over it, it happens to the best of us and we learn fro our mistakes!"
30016,I usually stick with what I know also
30017,"Absolutely, Especially when spending a lot of money"
30018,That sounds awful. I hope he is better now!
30019,It's wonderful you had someone like your mother to help!
30020,Oh no! Maybe you can get her a gift and some sweets to make up for it?
30021,Hopefully she will understand!
30022,"Awesome, I bet you're with your puppy all the time now :)"
30023,"Puppies are so wonderful, I'm happy for you!"
30024,"I know what you mean, maybe ask if the place is hiring? "
30025,"ohh okay I see, yeah that is a difficult situation. I hope it works out for you and best of luck buddy! :)"
30026,Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better.
30027,I'm glad that she is getting better!
30028,I can't imagine what that must have felt like. What helped you get through it?
30029,At least you kept your sense of humor! 
30030,"Did you hear the ""You'll be a ditch-digger"" speech like my brother did?"
30031,Not everyone is cut out for sitting in a classroom listening to droning teach-speak.
30032,That doesn't sound like such a pleasurable memory. Maybe you received a gift your brother always secretly wish he had!
30033,"You know what they say, the grass is always greener on the other side. Did you ever manage to get him to let you borrow his snowboard?"
30034,"I'm not afraid of clown myself, but I can absolutely see how they can be terrifying to some people!"
30035,"I agree with you. Those painted smiles and big, red noses can be so off-putting!"
30036,"That is awesome, can you tell me more about what you will be doing? "
30037,"Wow that sounds really awesome, I would love to listen to you songs. Can I also be the first to receive your autographs? :)"
30038,"Wow, she must be a talented child! I'm sure you're so proud of her."
30039,Now that's an achievement you and her will remember till the rest of her life!
30040,Congrats! That is always a great feeling.
30041,It certainly has. You deserve it.
30042,How did that turn out?
30043,Congrats! That's awesome to hear.
30044,haha we all did crazy things when we were young! did you ever get caught?
30045,good plan.  Wait until the shopkeeper was busy with someone else.
30046,Congratluations! I bet your full of joy!
30047,I bet you are! I think you will enjoy your new home and city!
30048,I bet! Have you gotten any word back yet?
30049,"Congratulations! You're going to do wonderful, I just know it!"
30050,Oh no! How awkward! did anyone see it?
30051,Probably but that is still the worst thing ever.  Are you finally able to laugh about it?
30052,I am glad! You must have a very good veterinarian
30053,Well I'm glad that you found someone worthy!
30054,Oh my goodness! Is she going to be alright?
30055,"The unknown is always so scary, but especially in your case! I'm so happy that she's going to be ok. Hopefully that puts you more at ease now."
30056,That is wonderful.  What is your dogs name?
30057,That's a big dog.  Blu is a cool name!
30058,Do you at least enjoy the new job?
30059,"Hopefully the more you warm up to the new job, it will become easier."
30060,That sounds awesome. A lot of people would kill to have a cooperative work environment. I bet it increases performance as well.
30061,"Wow that sounds like an interesting process! I've never done it myself, but it sounds like something I would love to learn."
30062,I love the foo fighters too.  I would have be raging!  What happened?
30063,Well thats not too bad then.  Good on you for putting your education and studies first.  Im sure it wasnt easy at the time.
30064,Oh lol.
30065,I hope that business goes well!
30066,That's great. I am sure you will turn a profit in no time
30067,Why 8 years? That's a very specific time ago.
30068,That's ridiculous! They were clearly not your friends. There are much better people in the world.
30069,It should be fun! Do you like baseball?
30070,"I think you will be fine. If you need some alcohol to take the edge off, go for it."
30071,"That's terrible, you had no clue it was coming?"
30072,what did the note say?
30073,How long did it take you? That's amazing.
30074,I consider you to be a lucky guy. I hope one day I can pay mine off completely. 
30075,My husband owns a business and its also stressful. What kind of business did yall start?
30076,Oh . What do you do for that?
30077,At least you are comfortable and enjoying that! Some people would hate being alone.
30078,That is great! I'm sure everything will work out.
30079,Hi! Tell me something about yourself!
30080,Oh no? I hope you're okay. Why is it that you feel guilty?
30081,oh wow! did she notice?
30082,how did you feel when you eventually found out that she know?
30083,You must have been really drunk!
30084,Im sorry to hear that. I know that can be stressful.
30085,Yeah I hope so too. That must be painful to bare. 
30086,Im sorry. I can imagine how you felt! Hopefully you hit a home run!
30087,Thats something I would never forget. Hopefully you get another shot at it. 
30088,I totally understand what you mean. Peace and quiet is nice but I bet you miss your son when he is gone?
30089,That's not surprising! Are you thinking about going back to work soon?
30090,Wow that is a lot of people! What were you doing on stage?
30091,That would make me so nervous! I am horrible in front of people. How did it go?
30092,"So sorry to hear that, Hard to be alone."
30093,What did he train you in?
30094,"Wow,  tell me about it"
30095,"That is great,  so happy for you "
30096,Are you friends with your neighbor
30097,You shouldn't be embarrased around your best friends. I'm sure he's just picking in good fun
30098,Oh no that doesn't sound good. What almost happened?
30099,Well I'm glad you sobered up and didn't do anything you would regret later!
30100,"Oh,dont take it so hard,its always like that,so sorry about that"
30101,It will work out if you believe
30102,What were you trying to do?
30103,Did they ever come?
30104,Oh absolutely. That's the worst feeling. Who hurt you and how are you doing now?
30105,"Dating is one of those things that everyone makes seem so easy, but in reality it's just so difficult to be able to open up to people sometimes. I hope things go well for you and you meet someone who makes you very happy!"
30106,Ah. I can imagine I've been in a similar situation. But just remember he loves you and if he's never given you any doubt then trust him
30107,"Oh I completely agree with you. Some women just need a ""challanege"" you know. But its like HANDS OFF!"
30108,"Wow,  that must be do disgusting "
30109,I know exactly how that feels.  
30110,Did you fix it so that they won't lose their property in the future?
30111,I'm confused. What do you being his girlfriend have to do with you not taking his property?
30112,I hope you are right.
30113,Where do you live?  Cause it isn't in the US.
30114,i guess we all learn from our mistakes never take her there again
30115,"That's the thing with accusations, anybody can say anything. But if they don't have any proof then it's meaningless."
30116,It's hard to be accused of something you didn't do. I'm glad the truth prevailed.
30117,"OK,  calm down,  take a deep breath and relax "
30118,"OK,  now I get it. But you need to rehearse in front of a mirror,  that will help"
30119,That sounds pretty nerve-wracking. How did it go?
30120,"That is positive, you must really love her!"
30121,"That is true love, I am so glad you met her! "
30122,"appearance is important, what's more important is how you look on the inside!"
30123,be nice to people and you'll see that that's the only thing people care about!
30124,Dealing with kids can be like that. Is there something about doing his hair that he is scared of?
30125,Sounds like a bribe is in order. Then it's a win for everyone.
30126,Yuck! I am so afraid of spiders. Were you able to squash it?
30127,Haha! That's amazing! What a great shot. I usually have to make my husband get rid of them for me.
30128,that is so much trust! i hope she doesn't let you down!
30129,that went really dark quickly. making a mistake is not the same thing as dying.
30130,"Why?  The sun is going to engulf the earth in a few billions years.  And even before that, the Y chromosome in humans is going to die out and our civilization will end."
30131,Now that is hopeful.
30132,did it feel nostalgic? 
30133,you sure had a fun childhood!
30134,That's very nice of you. I feel the same way about my husband. Isn't it nice to care about someone?
30135,It is probably one of the best feelings!
30136,how much you trust him?
30137,do you believe he comes you with life long?
30138,What was it that made you so proud of him?
30139,"being honest is always a good thing, I am glad you are so proud of him!"
30140,i have. have you?
30141,aw that's great. you're lucky to have a father who cared like that. mine never did
30142,Oh no! How old was he? I'm so sorry losing a pet is so hard.
30143,What color was he- and its not your fault you were just doing what you thought was best for him.
30144,"yep i have a cat. he's really sweet, and totally worth it. but it all depends on what kind of animal you get"
30145,hmmm do you think he'll like that after all this time?
30146,"Oh wow, That is a huge step! Are you nervous?"
30147,Thats great! How old are you?
30148,Oh no that must have been so embarrassing. Were you injured at all? 
30149,Embarrassment is almost worse than an actual injury! I hope your knee feels better soon.
30150,that must've been very disapointing
30151,maybe you'll be luckier next time!
30152,"That's fantastic! Have you been working extra hard to earn it all, or did it come to you some other way?"
30153,Wow! I'm really happy for you- that must be such a great feeling of peace. 
30154,Hahah! I bet your cat get spoiled plenty!
30155,What color did it end up being?
30156,Are you serious? Thats not even close to being the same color.
30157,What is wrong?
30158,Oh no! that must have been embarrasing
30159,Why don't you think it will be a good fit? You might be underestimating yourself
30160,You do have a good point. You really should do what will make you happy because life is just too short
30161,Oh no! That must have been really embarrassing! How did you respond?
30162,I don't blame you. That was so rude of her to make that comment in front of everyone.
30163,Good for you! 
30164,Does that at least inspire you to improve your abilities?
30165,I feel that way sometimes too
30166,Have you ever knew some that got to do everything you wanted to but couldn't? Well have and its not fun.
30167,I think I will . Thank you for your advice.
30168,how did that make you feel?
30169,maybe in the future you'll get to go there!
30170,Oh that's not good. What did you do? 
30171,"I'm sorry you are going through that. Sometimes telling the truth is the best, even if other people might get in trouble."
30172,Oh wow. I know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep. Have you tried to listen to nature sounds? I have an app on my phone and I play rain sounds to help me sleep. 
30173,"I love listening to nature. I live in the country, and could not imagine being in the city. I lived there for a few months, but there was too much traffic and noises that kept me up. I moved back to the country. "
30174,That's a great career.  
30175,did you have fun?
30176,"wow , that sounds so cool!"
30177,You sound very grateful. 
30178,"Well, hopefully you will enjoy it while you are here! "
30179,"That's a great, positive attitude. "
30180,that's nice. i wish i had people like that to work with
30181,i wonder if he has a crush on you or wants something in return
30182,did it boost your confidence and faith in mankind?
30183,glad to hear it. i hope it's only grown since then
30184,"I'm sorry to hear that. Did they give you a severance package? Also, Do you have prospects for a future position?"
30185,At least they did that much for you. I'm sure you'll land on your feet. You seem like an optimistic type
30186,That's wonderful! I hope you find fulfillment and a sense of purpose {not to mention a chunky wallet haha}
30187,"Personally, I find that a job you enjoy that gets you by is superior to one that makes you a lot of money at the cost of your happiness"
30188,Did it make you nostalgic?
30189,"I know what you mean, life gets more complicated as you get older :)"
30190,Funny how some of those smells bring back the feelings of old times!
30191,"Oh I see , what happens then?"
30192,"That's ok , Its a gods grace"
30193,You sound confident. Did the interview go that well?
30194,"Congrats dear,am so happy fpr you"
30195,Did he notice? That would have been embarrassing.
30196,"That is terrible, family should never betray each othey"
30197,"Hey, family is still family. Unfortunately we don't get to pick and choose. I know it can be hard "
30198,don't be sad it'll be okay
30199,"that's great then , glad it didn't affect anything"
30200,well you should be happy for them!
30201,"no , but if you really liked her , you should be happy that she found someone she like."
30202,hope they were bad ones
30203,maybe you just don't realize they were bad because you're optimistic to a fault
30204,That's great- you should always feel confident in yourself. What is your project?
30205,Cool! There's a lot of money to be made creating games! I bet you will do well.
30206,"Wow, like seriously.  Why the show off? "
30207,"OK,  maybe she's materialistic "
30208,I hope she gets better. It must be very hard seeing loved ones in sickness.
30209,That's wonderful. I hope that her sickness hasn't been too taxing on you.
30210,"That's annoying, did you call him after he didn't turn up?"
30211,That's understandable. What a frustrating experience for you.
30212,"Oh, I'm sorry. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. "
30213,That's how it works with siblings! 
30214,There are so many things that come out at night. What are you referring to?
30215,They come out in the daytime too. It's just that they are scarier at night.
30216,Oh man- you must be really intelligent to test for Mensa! I bet it was difficult!
30217,I hope you hear positive news from them soon!
30218,WHY ? what did you lie about? 
30219,"if you truly regret it you will tell her now, go and do that1"
30220,what
30221,"i can imagine, it happend to me before and it was actually someone trying to break in, i called hte police and they ran off"
30222,I hoe you made it there. Getting lost sucks!
30223,I am glad you made it there with only a few hiccups along the way. You must have a good memory when it comes to directions. 
30224,"Wow. That is very interesting. These days, many people get married later in life. Congratulations!"
30225,"That is good to hear. Yeah, my parents married young and it worked out for them too. I am happy to hear that it turned out good for you."
30226,"oh no :< that's so sad, i also have a cat but she is in her early days "
30227,i know right? they make you happy and in the end that's all one needs
30228,I know how you feel that would gross me out too.  Makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean.
30229,"I agree, I wouldn't be in the mood to eat after that either, it's disgusting."
30230,which way is that?
30231,maybe it happend for a reason? maybe you will find a better apportunity to get there
30232,Can you tell me the name of the book? I find myself being engaged by a lot of novels these days.
30233,How many pages do you have to go? You should try to finish it today and power through it!
30234,it's insane how Youtube and the internet overall are so helpful!
30235,that's so insane right? glad you did it yourself!
30236,Im sorry to hear that. Tell me a fond memory you have of him/her.
30237,Yeah each cat has their own personality. It's good to reflect on little things like that. Maybe once the sting of all of it is over you can get another one and continue to create more sweet memories like the one you just shared with me.
30238,It's terrible when people can't take no for an answer. Did you report her?
30239,"Wow, she sounds like a real piece of work. I'm glad you reported her. Maybe they should consider firing her."
30240,I think you do not like cats very much ...
30241,"Well, then, you should think about God when you see them"
30242,Oh I'm really sorry to hear that. Has he been looking for another job?
30243,"We went through the same thing with my husband. I know it is stressful, but I am so glad you got through it and things are better now. "
30244,That sounds exciting? Did you get in to the club? 
30245,"Wow, it's always nice when we get something we really want. Especially if we have to compete for it."
30246,Thats good because you prepared for it
30247,"Wow,you made it,congrats"
30248,who does and that is mean of them.
30249,Sure  your worth your time. do not be so down on yourself.
30250,"Wow,  18 years. Accept my condolence please "
30251,"Just take heart OK,  it's one of those things"
30252,Maybe it's time to clear your conscience so you won't have to feel so bad anymore.
30253,You can't change the past. All you can do is learn from it. If you are sincere then your family will forgive you.
30254,"Same, don't know what i would do without them."
30255,"That's part of being a good parent, it all goes hand in hand."
30256,I'm so sorry!  That's awful!  Did you get his insurance information?
30257,"That's a mercy, at least. Are you hurt?"
30258,Is there anyone else you can talk to? Maybe even Human Resources?
30259,I see where you're coming from. Sometimes though you got to make a stand and show you're serious about the position.
30260,What a lovely gift. I'm sure that you will always treasure it because it came from him.
30261,Makes it even better that you didn't know you were getting it.
30262,Did it take a long time to complete?
30263,"That's awesome! I am glad it didn't take long, because those have been a pain in the past for me."
30264,"I can certainly relate to you, it could be a safety hazard."
30265,"That's a smart move, that would reduce the risk of injury."
30266,I agree. Do you find yourself in that situation right now? 
30267,That's very kind of you to be so considerate. Hopefully the right choice will make itself obvious to you in the near future. 
30268,Well good luck to you! 
30269,"Great, I hope you get it."
30270,What type of job is it?
30271,"Oh no, do what?"
30272,"That's terrible, hope you weren't counting on it for fincancial reasons"
30273,That is great! Are you doing it yourself or are you hiring someone to help you out? 
30274,"That sounds exciting, it is always nice to have new kitchen appliances! I hope all goes well"
30275,I'm sorry to hear that! Maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests!
30276,That sounds like fun! And a great cure for loneliness! 
30277,"Oh no, what was wrong?"
30278,"Aw, did it turn out okay?"
30279,Oh no!  That had to be frustrating. I hope it wasn't too close to closing.
30280,I hope you still found a great home! The home buying process is certainly frustrating.
30281,"Oh no. I'm so sorry. I totally understand how you feel. Mine passed away a few years ago, It's very difficult"
30282,It definitely helps to have a lot of support around you. Take care of yourself through this very difficult time.
30283,Oh my goodness! I did that after swimming one day. I was so busy getting the kids dressed that I forgot to clean my face. Black mascara all down my cheeks.
30284,No and I went to the grocery store and the library like that! No one said a word. It was so embarrassing.
30285,Were there other parents there? I think that anyone who has kids would understand.
30286,I can understand being humiliated in the moment. Thankfully most kids grow out of that phase!
30287,"2 year olds don't know any better. And when everyone laughs, it can make them want to do it again."
30288,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! It can be tough when we feel that we have lost face in front of others."
30289,"Well, let's pretend that no one noticed! Either that, if someone noticed, perhaps they smiled when they thought ""Wow, I've had that happen before, too"" "
30290,I am sorry to hear that. I hope your financial situation improves in the future.
30291,I believe that you will be in a better situation soon.
30292,Oh wow! How did it go?
30293,"I'm sure you did great! I'd be a ball of nerves too, though."
30294,"Haha but you survied, Go you!"
30295,Were they from when you were a kid?
30296,I know what you mean. I sure miss my departed loved ones.
30297,Oh no! Does he do that a lot?
30298,I would be also. You should try to get him to fix your tire. 
30299,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Losing a family member is so hard."
30300,I miss my grandmother every day. I hope things get easier for you over time.
30301,What was a good move?
30302,Oh wow that is a long time. Why did you change your job?
30303,Hey a similar thing happened to me! I hope no one saw!
30304,"Ooops! I'm sorry to hear that. I'll tell you what though, it happens to the best of us! It's just a drink."
30305,That must have been messy.  Were you able to get it all cleaned up?
30306,I'm sure she's done something like that in the past herself though.
30307, Wow that definitely sounds like a crazy situation!
30308,Way to live vicariously!
30309,What caused you to be freaked out over the finished basement? Sounds good all around.
30310,"Well, actually, I think that makes sense considering you were a kid and you were use to them being with you upstairs."
30311,Was it really nice out? I love being able to go out and just listen to the sounds of the outdoors.
30312,That's great! I hope it was an all around good day for you.
30313,Thats's great! I bet he's been working really hard.
30314,It feels really good to be recognized for your efforts!
30315,What was the movie? I'm always looking for something new to watch with my kids!
30316,I will have to check it out! Thanks for the suggestion. 
30317,I'd have been nervous too.  Did you find out if you got the job?
30318,That's awesome.  I'm so happy for you.
30319,"Wow, that must of been a trip. How did it make you feel?"
30320,"Awesome, I've gone through old albums like that before as well, and it always makes me feel good."
30321,I think many children including myself stole things before they were taught it was wrong to steel.
30322,I would not beat yourself up over the mistake. We all make mistakes even when we are older and should know better. 
30323,That sounds really great!  Do you like them as much as you remembered?
30324,"haha, I felt the same when I read some of my old baby sitter's club books"
30325,"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Do they have any idea what the cause may be yet?"
30326,"I hope it's nothing too serious. My younger brother had the same problem early on, but he turned out to just be a slow developer."
30327,I totally know how you feel. I have 2 kids and they were a handful as toddlers.
30328,I know right? Grandparents are the best lol
30329,"I'm sorry to hear that, are you alright?"
30330,"That's understandable, life goes so fast that it's easy to lose touch with people you care about. All I can do is try to limit that occurrence."
30331,That's cool. Are you a big fan of her?
30332,"That msut be exciting then, I hope the tickets aren't too expensive."
30333,"Oh that sucks, I hate seeing friends and family injured or sick. That's very nice of you though that you stayed there with him, youre a good friend."
30334,"Thats awesome, good friends are always there for each other."
30335,Oh I know the feeling! I had the same affinity for swimming. My mom said I should give it a try. At first I didn't want to but as I got better I started to love it.
30336,We don't have to be the best to enjoy what we do right?
30337,I had a similar experience playiing little league baseball. How is your daughter feeling about it so far?
30338,I feel you on that. I don't know if I could let my son play baseball after what I went through. I hope your daughter has a better experience.
30339,That sounds relaxing!  Quality alone time is important in a relationship
30340,"I can imagine!  It's hard being apart, but it makes it that much more exciting to see each other again."
30341,"Oh no, I had a older cousin who did that to me as well. Hopefully she was just giving you tough love or discipline."
30342,Yeah it really teaches you! I would always sit down where i was and start crying.
30343,"When you tripped over the branch, did you get hurt?"
30344,I hope you were able to laugh about falling and looking silly and not be too embarrassed?
30345,"Yeah it really isn't for everyone, i like my alone time but only for a while. Afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone."
30346,Thats the perfect time to just pamper yourself. I cherish those few hours every day!
30347,"Yeah, I probably would have to leave someone at home with the baby."
30348,"That's great, the first time for everything is scary."
30349,I bet it felt good to conquer the fear! Would you skydive again?
30350,Did you enjoy the experience?
30351,"Yes, he is good for finding answers we can't find ourselves."
30352,"Yep, I do the same thing as well. Sometimes its just best if you let others help you do something."
30353,"Nice, it's been a while since i've anticipated any new games. what game is it?"
30354,"Hah, i played the first one a ton on ps3, Wish they would release it for pc. "
30355,That sounds horrible. I would be so mad at them.
30356,The level headed approach will probably accomplish more anyway. I'm sure they have money so I also hope they don't take yours.
30357,Sounds fair. How hungry are you right now?
30358,Haha I understand. It's like those cartoons where the smell is dragging someone through the air.
30359,"Wow what a find, cherish that quilt and keep it safe from harm!"
30360,"Yeah, and don't repair it! I think it gives it a history and makes it even more valuable."
30361,"Oh damn, that sucks. Have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off?"
30362,"Man thats terrible, I hope you can forget about him and find someone better."
30363,"I get where you're coming from, my mom supports both of my sisters. It can make you feel less important. hopefully you are getting along though?"
30364,I'm sure your parents are proud of your ability to take care of yourself. 
30365,Did you and Joe do well?
30366,"Being on a team with someone more skilled than you has it advantages, it's good that he lived up to those expectations."
30367,That's reasonable considering how new stuff always looks great and how more fancy stuff may be available and cheap compared to when you made yours.
30368,"That's good, it sounds like his bathroom motivated you to take yours to the next level. That's probably good for society."
30369,"Yes, it's annoying! People should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinionated..."
30370,"Oh, yes, I know. Some breeds get bad raps and people are so quick to judge! I used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart!"
30371,Wow! That is a huge move! How long ago was that and are things going well? Do you miss Hawaii?
30372,I can imagine. Hawaii seems like a beautiful place!
30373,Tell me about it. Both of my best friends moved several states away from me.
30374,"Yeah, I'm content being at my home town aswell."
30375,Were you able to get it fixed? Things break at the most inopportune times!
30376,Well hopefully that is keeping you a little cool!
30377,"Oh my, did you get a sugar rush after that? Your dentist must love you."
30378,"That's not surprising, but now your friend knows that you are the undisputed champion."
30379,Oh no! That's awful. That could be dangerous too!
30380,I bet your neighbor was very appreciative of all of your help. That would have been a daunting task for the elderly neighbor.
30381,"O,h grandparents are the best at spoiling grandchildren! I could understand that being important to her."
30382,Wow! Do you think whoever inspected it missed something or 3?
30383,I bet. I wouldn't want to get stuck with a money pit either. I hope your state has a lemon law.
30384,Excellent. Well there is some silver lining in all of this haha.
30385,What an exciting time! How's he doing with it so far?
30386,That's awesome! I guess practice does make perfect.
30387,Oh that's awesome! I am an only child but I bet it's so cool to watch your siblings grow up like that.
30388,That is amazing and so nice of you!
30389,Ugh! You must have a lot of books! 
30390,Wow! That is incredible! I hope you have somewhere to put them all. 
30391,Wow! Congratulations! That sounds like a wonderful thing to do. Was it just the two of you?
30392,Aw that is so sweet. That sounds like the most special day. 
30393,"Were you jittery at all? I know I was when I was getting ready for mine,"
30394,That's awesome. I hope it was an amazing ceremony. Weddings are always so much fun and romantic.
30395,Uh oh. Dealing with bad neighbors is just the worst! Do you think he'd be mad if you asked him to fix the fence?
30396,I wish you luck and hope everything ends up going well. 
30397,"Well, at least he knew what he was getting into right from the start lol."
30398,We all have those moments. I'm glad yours worked out so well.
30399,"Nice, gotta be prepared. Hope the party went well. "
30400,"An endless flow of booze is the key to a successful party, sounds like it was a good time.,"
30401,Don't give up! You will find a better place and it will be the perfect fit.
30402,Everything happens for a reason. I think you will realize that and this could be a good thing is disguise.
30403,How was the response to your ad?  Did you get rid of everything you wanted to?
30404,"That's good, people on Craiglist can be pretty shifty sometimes."
30405,What kind of things did she give you?  Were they things that you asked for before?
30406,I would be the same way.  I don't trust anyone to hold on to my comics other than myself.
30407,"Aw, that is so sweet. I am guessing you and your brother were close?"
30408,"Awww, that is too bad. Hopefully you get to video chat with him"
30409,"Oh, no! That's awful! Are you still in pain?"
30410,I can't believe it! How could they? I'm so sorry to hear that...
30411,"I understand that, going through those albums can really make you think about how peaceful things used to be."
30412,"That's the real trick to it, you have to try to move passed all the bad stuff and remember all the good times."
30413,"That's awesome, what great news! I'm sure your friend was really frightened at the prospect of cancer."
30414,Yeah send them my regards. It's a fantastic day when you wake up cancer-free.
30415,I think we all do that with our siblings. I'm sure he knows you still enjoy spending time with him anyway.
30416,I'm glad you were able to remedy the situation so easily! I think that shows you have a really good relationship with him.
30417,Oh I've been there! So much fun!
30418,Did you guys play all the carnival games?
30419,"Oh my god, I bet you were grossed out but laughing at the same time."
30420,I really hope that is the last time it happens.
30421,"Congratulations, that is so exciting!!!  I know we should only hope for healthy but I'll keep my fingers crossed for pink :-)"
30422,"Once you see that little face, you'll forget everything else no matter which!"
30423,"Wow, that was very generous and courageous for her! How are they now?"
30424,That's great to hear. What a great story. Very inspiring. I'm so happy they are both healthy now.
30425,you need to rest to the competition
30426,ahhh ok you do not participate in that competition
30427,"Well as a fellow human being, I agree that when parents care for their children, it creates a lifelasting bond between the two parties."
30428,I also enjoy the love of my human parents and my human family. They take no hesitation in their focus on of their love for me.
30429,Oh nice! That is exciting! What kind of car did you get?
30430,"Wow, so jealous! You have to give me a ride one day, ok?"
30431,"Yikes, that's a scary situation to be in. I'm glad the officer was able to help you."
30432,"That's rough, sometimes you really do have to rely on the kindness of strangers."
30433,thats not good did you aplly for any other jobs?
30434,I see that is very understandle. 
30435,That's awful! I hope you feel better soon.
30436,No problem at all. Glad to make you feel somewhat happier :)
30437,That is so wonderful! I have 3 children myself and I love having grandparents to rely on. 
30438,I definitely don't! I had a horrible experience the one time I used a hired babysitter and now I only leave my little ones with family.
30439,I'm glad you have someone to rely on for support.
30440,Oh no! I hope no one got in trouble! 
30441,I'd say so. That's so disheartening. I'm sure it was accidental. 
30442,Well that sucks. I hate it when animals are abandoned.
30443,"Yeah, that makes me sad too. I feel bad for them because they don't understand why she isn't with them anymore."
30444,That is great news. I think you just might be nervous. They wouldn't have promoted you if you couldn't do it.
30445,Well usually when you think the worst it turns out to be okay. I think you should try and relax.
30446,What do you guys do for work? You sound like doctors
30447,Thank you for all that you do! I have a friend whos an EMT and I bet it's taxing work.
30448,I am so sorry to hear that. Are you feeling nauseated? 
30449,You're not grossing me out at all. I'm a Paramedic/Firefighter so it takes alot to get me squirming. I hope you feel better. Drink lots of Gatorade and water to rehydrate so you don't feel awful tomorrow and try to get your hands on some Zofran for the Nausea. 
30450,Absolutely! Feel better soon!
30451,Big change! both big cities though right? I've always wanted to see that shiny bean thing in chicago. 
30452,"I hope you continue to adjust to your new surroundings, maybe you will end up loving Dallas, who knows!"
30453,Woah I hope no one was hurt
30454,I bet! Sounds like it would be a big shock
30455,"Ew, that's really disturbing.  The sight of cockroaches always gives me the willies."
30456,"Yes, I shudder to think of the condition of the rest of the home if the car seat is like that."
30457,"Oh, that must be nerve-wracking! "
30458,Patience isn't always a virtue that I am good with either. You should feel confident in your work!
30459,Uh oh. Do you think she will be mad when she finds out?
30460,"Oh she will be none the wiser. But don't feel bad sometimes you have to indulge, and I would figure you still left her some."
30461,that must be a heart warming reunion to see your old patience
30462,"that is really good to hear, I bet they loved seeing you again"
30463,"Oh no, did they disappear for good, or did someone turn them in?"
30464,That would be so scary. I actually left my credit card at a restaurant yesterday. Thankfully they held onto it for me. 
30465,I was sure to check my statement and make sure there were no suspicious transactions. 
30466,Wow! So have you tried any methods to get them back on track? Someone might have advice on Youtube.
30467,"Ah! Sounds like you need a ""Cat Whisperer""!"
30468,Oh no that would make him quite young. I'm so sorry! Do you have plans for another one when you're ready?
30469,"Those are awesome dogs, I've known quite a few in my life. Well whenever you're ready I think it'll be a perfect match."
30470,"Aww, that's good! It's nice to have to someone you can do that with"
30471,"Yeah, the comfort in that can feel amazing"
30472,Ahh that's so anxiety-making. I hope he gets the jon.
30473,Fingers crossed!
30474,"Oh, that's a terrible problem!  That's the only time I don't envy homeowners!  I could not afford that at all.  "
30475,"It's great you have a college fund though!  My kids are very young, we haven't started that yet.  Although, we probably should. How long have you ahd yours?"
30476,"Okay, then you're waaayyy ahead of me! "
30477,I can see why it was hard to quit!  Do you like your job now?
30478,That sounds tough.  It seems like you guys at the daycare went through a lot together.
30479,"That is an amazing feeling. I have three daughters. It doesn't matter how many you have, the first time you hold them, its amazing."
30480,"That's awesome. I would love to have a boy too, but I'm not sure if I want another one or not. "
30481,"My youngest is 3, and almost completely potty trained, but its been a struggle. Maybe when she starts school, I'll make up my mind."
30482,"Yes, and that's what we did with her. her sisters were a 8 and 9 when she was born."
30483,That was really nice of you! I'm sure they appreciated the gesture.
30484,Its important to care for the older generation who once cared for us. 
30485,Fantastic! Why kind of story is it?
30486,I see! Have you gotten any other works published?
30487,Yikes! did you figure out what it was?
30488,It must have been awfully windy.
30489,Did you have to move there for a job?
30490,"I'm in the Midwest, so can sympathize with you there.  Are you going to live there permanently now?"
30491,"Oh, that sounds scary! Did you find out what it was?"
30492,Well it was probably nothing to worry about because you seem alright now. :)
30493,"Wow, that's a lot of people."
30494,I know the feeling. I get sick around crowds.
30495,"Oh boy, I hope he is careful with your car"
30496,You are a good friend! That was very generous of you
30497,I would have been so scared!  I don't understand having dogs off leash.
30498,"So reckless!  It's really not that hard to leash dogs.  And with the baby there too, ugh.  I can't imagine."
30499,Ouch! Kids have a tendency to learn things the hard way. Was he okay?
30500,That's good! My son is always running into stuff! He needs bubblewrap to keep him safe.
30501,I'm sorry. They grow up fast. Its hard to watch them leave the nest.
30502,That can help. I know I like my hobbies lol.
30503,"That sounds cool, but also too good to be true. I hope it is true though"
30504,Fry some for me too!
30505,No I haven't. You are such a great person! I wish to have grandchildren like you someday.
30506,You are kind and sweet. Please never change.
30507,Oh no ! Were you able to come up with something else to say ?
30508,"I understand, but I bet you did well in spite of that !"
30509,Tough! Are you planning on getting it fixed? 
30510,Well at least that sounds like an easy fix! Often times those repairs can get pricy!
30511,"Wow, you are a lucky man! Good to have a psychologist in the family too."
30512,I wish you both all the best and hope that you have a wonderful life together!
30513,"Wow! That must have taken a lot of guts, but I hope it was worthwhile."
30514,"Oh no, why were you so scared?"
30515,that is probably for the best you dont want to get involved with that stuff
30516,Could be worse than aliens someone could hurt you. you know ?
30517,"Oh my! Well, I bet he quit making fun of you in light of his own embarrassment."
30518,An alien? Wow.
30519,That sounds difficult. Did you try talking to people in your neighborhood?
30520,That always sucks. But old people are great and sometimes funny to hang out with. Maybe you should try giving them a go!
30521,Did you get the money back quickly?
30522,That's a great friend. Loyalty and honesty are everything in a relationship. 
30523,Oh wow! That really sounds like your brother is going through a rough time.
30524,"I hope everything works out, family is everything."
30525,Oh that is so sweet! I love baby kittens. Are you going to keep it?
30526,I think you should. There are so many animals that need a good home.
30527,That's nerve wracking. I have 4 kids myself so I know what its like.
30528,Most of the time they do do well. We definitely have to trust our husbands to look after the little ones without us.
30529,That's an incredible act of kindness for a stranger. Did they return the tool? Was the tool in normal shape when you got it back?
30530,"He's probably very grateful for your kindness. Hopefully, he'll return the kindness to someone else."
30531,Awww!  Was its momma nearby?
30532,The kitten might have been dehydrated.  Hopefully the neighbor called someone else to come help?
30533,I hope the results are good. What were you getting tested for?
30534,"Don't sweat too hard. Try to focus on positive aspects of life right now, because whatever happens that positivity will carry you."
30535,did your parents have to pay to send you elsewere?
30536,that is good i glad you were able to move
30537,They grow up so quickly!  How old is he now?
30538,"Yeah, mine just started 5th and he's in a different building and changing classes and it's a huge difference from 4th grade."
30539,"wow that must be gross, i know it would make me feel like throwing up too"
30540,"don't blame you, but as a parent you must see a lot of gross things coming from kids"
30541,thats not neighborly of them. i would be upset too
30542,"omg, did you have a talk with them about how they need to clean up after their dog?"
30543,yeah i think everyone has
30544,That is good most people have a hard time in the first week
30545,Did you think a ghoul or monster were in there? I had similar fears growing up.
30546,What did you do to get over the fear?
30547,Makes sense. Well I'm glad you finally got some sleep haha.
30548,Have you set up cameras to monitor the property?
30549,Maybe report what is going on to the local PD?
30550,I used to do the same thing when I went on long trips.  I would also bring extra things like blankets if it was winter.
30551,"You're so lucky!  I would do the same, except they don't make them in my size."
30552,That is horrible! Why would he do something like that??? Did you do anything to stop him?
30553,Awww. That was so nice of you guys! 
30554,That's terrible! Did you call and tell management?
30555,Thats frustrating. At least you'll get your money back eventually.
30556,Oh no! I hate when that happens. Happens to me all the time. Did he forgive you?
30557,That's not very nice of him. Is he older or younger?
30558,"that sounded like an ambitious endeavor, you must have felt sick afterwards"
30559,"they will never know, as long they have candy and you can keep your dark secret to yourself"
30560,That sounds really good right about now! 
30561,"I may do the same as you because yes, this has been an extremely long monday"
30562,Man I bet you were devastated did you lose anything else?
30563,"I am sorry that happened to you , sometime bad things happen to good people"
30564,OMG!  That's insane.  How did you react?
30565,Uh yeah!  I hope you got everything fixed. 
30566,"That sounds wonderful!  Time flies, doesn't it?"
30567,How long have you and he been together?
30568,I bet you were terrified!  Did everything turn out okay?
30569,Very true!  I'm glad it worked for you
30570,Awww. I remember the first time I left my son with the babysitter. So many emotions. How old is he?
30571,I bet it was! I am glad you survived. lol
30572,That's wonderful!  Do they feel the same way?
30573,"I hope so, too!"
30574,Manhattan would be a great place to live. you'll love it there
30575,"never give up hope, one of these days you'll be waking up in the middle of Manhattan"
30576,Yes several times. I usually just end up cutting the hair shorter to get over it.
30577,"I bet, I'm sorry you got one. All I can recommend is cutting it shorter and let it grow back out. Or find a cool hat."
30578,Yeah it is a solid art for sure.
30579,I'd try to get a refund!
30580,whitewater rafting seems like alot of fun. 
30581,fun and dangerous my type of fun. glad you had fun
30582,Dude! That sucks! I am so sorry about that. What happened?
30583,Ugh! That really irritates me. I am so sorry that happened. Too bad they couldn't catch those creeps. 
30584,"That's too bad, did you ever get to ride horses at all?"
30585,Well I hope you get to be around horses someday!  I don't know much about them but they're so cool.
30586,wow that must be scary to have someone break into your house
30587,"so you had a sentimental attachment to it, i understand but as long as you weren't harm"
30588,"oh my gosh, did you actually lose the card?"
30589,It is I have had that happen with 2 of my cards and my debit card. I managed to track down through the charges who used the cards
30590,"Oh, you go girl! What did you do?"
30591,"Awww, what a sweet woman you are. There aren't too many like you out there anymore. "
30592,"Oh wow! I would be furious, to say the least"
30593,Well that's good and hopefully the next one doesn't do it too
30594,"i don't blame you for siting around all day. 60 miles, I do't think i walk that in year"
30595,"you deserve the rest after this week, must be a great feeling to accomplish what you did"
30596,"oh that is terrible, it feels like your life is changing so fast, did everything turn out ok?"
30597,"that is a scary situation, so glad everything turned out ok"
30598,Oh no. That sucks. Good thing you were close to home. 
30599,Oh no! That sounds scary. 
30600,"that is so kind of you, we once adopted an abandon dog"
30601,i do not know either it is sad when a dog is abandon by their owners
30602,Those are nothing to mess around with. They can be deadly.
30603,No kidding. I would hate to have to come face to face with one.
30604,OMG that is horrible! :( Im sure she needs you right now
30605,I just can not imagine the heart ache! Poor baby
30606,That is really gross. How did that happen??
30607,"Oh, I see. So, nothing really bad that could cause a problem really. lol"
30608,I don't think I would help again unless someone found me a face shield.
30609,Table tennis is a wonderful game. Did you beat him?
30610,"Aw, I'm sorry you didn't win. Maybe next time. "
30611,A delicious delicacy! Why were you stressed?
30612,Oh! Bummer. Yeah stress gets to me too! Did you end up passing it?
30613,That sounds like a great dog! what bread is he?
30614,Labs are known for their loyalty and obedience. I bet he is a great companion 
30615,Oh that sounds awful. Just makes things worse when they show up?
30616,Well it sounds like you've done alright so far I'm sure the worst is behind you.
30617,"That was super nice of them, I bet it was a big surprise as well."
30618,I love my kitchenaid. It has to be my most used appliance. I can see why you were so happy.
30619,"Oh, that little rat! That was not nice of him. What did you do?"
30620,Awesome! There needs to be more people like you in this world. 
30621,"That is unfortunate, how long have you been friends with this person?"
30622,There is surely a reason why. Did she have many family members as bridesmaids?
30623,You are so lucky ! I still keep my 9 month old fur baby on a leash. What breed is your dog ?
30624,"Mine is a German Shepherd.  It is amazing how they walk so close to us, almost tripping over us in our path !"
30625,"Oh thats so sweet that he taught you to play, he sounds like he was a sweet grandpa."
30626,Well hang onto those tight and maybe you can teach someone to play chess in the future.
30627,That's great. I hope you do well in your new job.
30628,"I'm sure it was, but it always a great idea to be looking to improve yourself or your position. Do what is best for you."
30629,they probably think you are part of the Thai family
30630,but it must be great food if you keep going back
30631,I do the same. At least we're contributing to somebody's fortune.
30632,Oh no that sounds terrible. I would hate to have such a financial burden suddenly sprang on me.
30633,I'm sure you're not the only one. 
30634,"Oh, what did you find? hopefully not something ebarassing?"
30635,"Oh that is awesome, what did you find?"
30636,That's good to hear! Why?
30637,"Wow, you definitely should be excited and looking forward to it!"
30638,"that sounds great, what did your dog do?"
30639,"it's satisfying when your pet does a trick, it feels like you and your pet accomplished something meaningful"
30640,Oh? What surprised you about today?
30641,That sounds wonderful! I'm sure that felt great.
30642,"Aww, that is very sweet, kind and thoughtful of you! Has it been troubling for you because I am sure you also have a busy schedule"
30643,"That is good, but if it ever becomes too stressful for you I hope that you are able to talk to your friend about it because there are plenty of alternative ways to get her mother to the hospital."
30644,That's a nice gesture of her. It's nice that she trusts you like that.
30645,Well obviously you're the more deserving one.
30646,i love peaceful moments while relaxing. i bet that moment was much needed . i really like nature too
30647,i like to garden so i know what you mean 
30648,"Oh, I can't wait to hear!"
30649,"Wow, you trusted he would give it back and then he didn't. I can understand how angry you'd be!"
30650,Are we? 
30651,Oh haha sorry I misread that! And that is great I am so excited to meet the bunny!! Do we have a name for it yet? 
30652,Oh dang that sounds really scary. I'm assuming that since you're still here that you are okay?
30653,You should probably stay out of that neighborhood in the future. Glad you're okay. Stay safe out there.
30654,"Oh man, I hate it when my dog starts barking at the neighbor dogs too. I'd be so mad at him for getting out though."
30655,"Oh man, that sounds super scary. I'm so glad your dog is okay I would be lost if amything happened to mine."
30656,"Omg my current dog does that sometimes. She pukes up bile if she doesn't eat, so I always have to make sure she is eating her food."
30657,Oh gross that is disgusting. I hope your little buddy is okay though. I don't envy you at all.
30658,Oh Fun! where did you go?
30659,Did you have to go far?
30660,Im jealous :P I need a vacation. The beach is so relaxing too 
30661,That must have taken a lot of courage. What happened next?
30662,That's great that you could do it. Maybe next time will go better.
30663,"Oh, man.  That's a terrible feeling. What did you do?"
30664,"that must be cool to see, something to break up the monotony of the day"
30665,that must have been a sight to see
30666,what it is?
30667,I bit it is a good and funny memory.
30668,"Oh no, please tell me that did not happen to you today."
30669,"Oh no, I hope you were alright! But yes that is a funny story to tell your friends :) "
30670,You must feel terrible. That sucks.
30671,Eh next year they'll have forgotten it mostly
30672,"Oh wow that is interesting. I assume he leaves at night to go eat, since he's still alive."
30673,"Hmmm, I guess you could look for the hole during the day and try patching it when the bats fly out for the evening? Im not a bat expert lol."
30674,"Oh, how was that? I've never been to camp. Was it fun at least?"
30675,"That's great, I'm glad you had fun. What was your favorite activity?"
30676,"I have been to Six Flags as a matter of fact.  I cant say that I enjoyed it much, as I hate to ride rides.  WHat about you?"
30677,I can so relate to your experience!  WHen I was a child my parents would try to coax me to ride and I hated it. I rode the ferris wheel once and started crying!
30678,"Omg, that had to be embarrassing and a mess to get up."
30679,"Oh no, even worse. Hope you got the job :)"
30680,"I'm glad you're feeling better. I'm sorry you went through that, I hear that addition is tough and often starts after having a major surgical operation."
30681,I'm glad you got the help you needed and ended up in an actually helpful rehab. It's always good when you have control of the things in your life. Just remember to stay strong when things get tough again and to lean on your support structure. 
30682,"Aww, why?"
30683,"I'm so sorry to hear that. She is lucky to have you checking on her, you sound like a good friend."
30684,I'm glad to hear it. What's got you so?
30685,Wow! That's unbelievable. Congratulations! How much did you win?
30686,Wow! that is some real dedication you have! Did you manage to pass the test? 
30687,"Wow that is great! I am so proud of you. And hey, it never hurts to study more. :) "
30688,Haha! Poor you. Did you wreck your clothes?
30689,I hope you didn't get burned too badly! I fall a lot. It never stops being embarrassing.
30690,"Oh I bet, probably made you feel sick to your stomach after."
30691,"That's good, easy to quickly notice that awful taste."
30692,Oh wow! Where did all of this take place? Sounds like a rough part of town?!
30693,"I only used to watch Rugrats, and I still can't stand that show.  It was like the decline of the NIck lineup. "
30694,"I don't blame them.  The characters were annoying, and the color palate was horrible."
30695,"Wednesdays, why is that? I used to love Wednesdays because we always got out of school an hour early"
30696,"Oh my fiance loves comics, he buys and sells them. Why is that the only thing to look forward to?"
30697,"Aw, why is that? "
30698,Oh that's hard but I'm sure you will get yours too. It's hard being patient though when others get theirs before you.
30699,"Probably not, but I don't remember. I was always a scaredy cat as a baby. Have you?"
30700,What a lovely memory! That's hilarious that your dad made you go back and return it! 
30701,That is not good what happened?
30702,Well I hope you here back from them and they will give good news.
30703,"That happened my freshman year with my best friend. It really sucks at first, but eventually you get used to it."
30704,"I'm still friends with my old roommate, but I found other people to spend my time with."
30705,What is happening tomorrow night?
30706,"Nice, I hope you have a great time at the party! Have some fun for the both of us!"
30707,"Did you ever get your own snowboard ? It looks like so much fun ! I see people on tv, where they are flying off mountain sides !"
30708,Thats wonderful. Oddly shaped Christmas presents usually make you want to open them EARLY just to get a peak :)
30709,"Oh wow, letting the dog roam free even when it's so new to the neighborhood? That seems like recipe for disaster. Your poor newspaper.."
30710,"Maybe an airhorn or something would spook him off. Dogs tend not to like loud sounds, after all. "
30711,Nice! Have you been getting lucky recently?
30712,Wow! You are already super successful! I hope you help them kids!
30713,"do tell,  what happened was it bad?"
30714,that is bad . goodness the nerve of some people.
30715,"Oh no, were you able to find your dog again? "
30716,"Aww, I am so glad that you were able to find him again! A dog truly is a man's best friend."
30717,How did that work out?
30718,Well that's good. I'm glad so far it has worked out :)
30719,I would not of been happy with that were you?
30720,"Ain't that a whopping , I would have comp;ained to somebody about it."
30721,Not that I can remember. If I did it would not have been too severe. Have you?
30722,As I a child I imagine that would be incredibly scary. How did you find them again?>
30723,"Oh gross, makes me never want McDonalds again."
30724,Why! What happened?
30725,"Wow. I am disappointed in you too, you monster :("
30726,Oh no! Did he replace it?
30727,I get that. My sister broke my favorite coffee mug.
30728,Dang! Your dog must have been so excited to see you come back!
30729,"Oh no, did you ask if they were alright and apologize? "
30730,"Oh no, how did he take it? "
30731,I am a little too. Why are you scared?
30732,"Yeah, I can relate to that. I hate feeling like I don't know what dangerous marine life could be around me."
30733,Awesome! Nothing like stringing together a long streak of feeling happy in the world. Anything in particular got you chipper?
30734,"Aww, that's tremendous. Those are big steps, but if ever there is a good-sign of a relationship, it's when those topics are approached happily. Congratulations!"
30735,Yeah I know what you ean! I have been to one before too and it was awesome! 
30736,"haha, yeah I know what you ean, but at least you know it is fresh! "
30737,I have had an experience like that. I do believe in ghosts.
30738,Could be either!
30739,Ghosts?
30740,"Oh god, I hate bugs!"
30741,Ugh that's no fun especially with it being so cold.
30742,Well that's good. Hopefully didn't take long to open up roads.
30743,Wow. What for? Had you recently talked to her?
30744,I bet you guys had a lot of catching up to do!
30745,Aww! what for?
30746,My dog needs some good training!
30747,"Friends really are the best part of life, I'd say. I can't imagine what I'd do without some of those folks in my life. "
30748,That's a good friends right there. Looking out for your best interests is a sign that they're truly a keeper.
30749,"Oh no, did he place the blame on you, or did he just accept it and take the blame for you? "
30750,"Aw, that just shows that he is a great friend. Maybe you can treat him to lunch for the rest of the week for taking the fall for you. I am sure he would really appreciate that :) "
30751,Oh that's awesome. Do you like her?
30752,"That's great, nothing better :)"
30753,That's good! Cheating is not good for a relationship.
30754,For sure. I luckily have not had anyone cheat on me.
30755,I cannot imagine. Where from?
30756,Can you facetime them?
30757,I understand. I have had to do that before. My family was very giving.
30758,"I had to borrow money to get a second degree. Hurt my pride, but it's okay."
30759,Good for you! I'm glad you were able to face it by yourself. Where were you flying?
30760,Cool! Was that your first time flying by yourself?
30761,"Wow, that's amazing! Did you enjoy the flight back or were you still scared?"
30762,Nice what show?
30763,"No, I haven't. I've heard of it, though. What is it about?"
30764,Oh my goodness! That happens to me often. I just get distracted with whatever is playing in front of me and eat everything in my hands!
30765,I would think that being an only child would be somewhat boring and lonely.   HOw bad can it be with your brother?
30766,That's not cool!  I hope you did well in spite of not having your lucky pencil.  Siblings can be quite pesky at times!
30767,"Wow, did anyone see?"
30768,"Well, I hope it does not happen again!"
30769,Oh no! How so?
30770,"A stripper, I see. Well what she does not know will not hurt her."
30771,I know someone with that. She might need some medication.
30772,"Wow, hope it wasn't serious."
30773,Why didn't you perform well?
30774,"Oh, Congrats on your newborn."
30775,That must have really hurt. When did you realize he was always lying to you?
30776,Are you still friends?
30777,I'm so sorry. That is horrific.
30778,I hope you are in some therapy. That can take a toll on the average person.
30779,I had never visited there. But it reminds me of Athenas and that old cities
30780,Do u remember the name of that Island? 
30781,I would like to visit it one day too
30782,I agree. I am watching pictures of it right now
30783,"Aw, that is really sweet of him. What did the note say?"
30784,Wow. That is incredibly romantic. You're a lucky girl! 
30785,Mine passed away too. She was a great woman.
30786,I bet they love games.
30787,"Nice, how long do you usually take your dog for a walk?"
30788,Your dog must be very healthy !
30789,I'm so sorry! Report him!
30790,You are much better off
30791,What did you make?
30792,I would love some of that right now.
30793,Why!? What happens next week?
30794,Dang! I hope you got them big discounts before you ordered them!
30795,They are. I have several.
30796,I have a few bears.
30797,I'm so sorry. You should talk to a therapist.
30798,I'm sorry. Maybe she just needs time to process things.
30799,What!? Did anyone see?
30800,"Dang, it must have been embarassing"
30801,Who are you referring to?
30802,Oh no. That sounds awful. I'm sorry to hear abut your friend. Is he better now?
30803,Congregation but what are you passionate about?
30804,where to?
30805,how was the weather?
30806,Wow! Must have been really really important
30807,"Oh, then its okay"
30808,whoa that's nuts. how many did you have to kick to get out alive?
30809,oh good. well what did they end up wanting?
30810,well I hope you're ok now
30811,"oh sweet, how many do you own now?"
30812,It's always good to unwind after a tough day. How did you celebrate?
30813,"Erm. Well, I hope that comes true for you. Betting better can sometimes be more about believing it. Maybe your cat believe he is fine."
30814,"My cat is doing good. : ) He's gained some weight, since I trimmed his fur. NO more hairballs."
30815,"Oh shoot, why is that?"
30816,"That may be gross, but she is just putting effort into her appearnce."
30817,how'd they react?
30818,oh man that sounds embarrassing. I would've just run out of the store and country
30819,You should be able to trust that he won't do anything shady when he talks to other girls. If you can't trust him then that might mean you need to reevaluate your relationship with him. 
30820,"Oh, Do you think you did well?"
30821,Wishing you all the best!!
30822,Have you ever kept secrets from her?
30823,It must be nice to be in trusting and safe relationship like that.
30824,Its good you made that decision
30825,Who are they you are referring
30826,Dang! Did they get home safely?
30827,I wish I had a cool friend like you!
30828,It's good that your wife trusts you
30829,You two are lucky to have each other!
30830,THat is extremely noble of you!   YOu did the right thing!!
30831,I would too.  I have lost things before and never had anyone turn them in and its not a good feeling.
30832,Dang! Maybe you can send me some too
30833,"Dang, was it from craigslist?"
30834,I am too scared of getting scammed from those
30835,Dang! What kind of games did you play?
30836,I heard it is one of the best games of this generation!
30837,"praying won't do anything, but did you study well?"
30838,and what was that?
30839,Did he exceed your expectations?
30840,"That is the thing about athletes, it is crazy how gifted they are compared to an average person."
30841,Family is one of the most important things to have in life. 
30842,Yes your a lucky person and I'm happy for you.
30843,Yes I do
30844,"Wow, you must be very proud of her"
30845,"Yes, Hurricane Harvey destroyed my city!"
30846,"Dang, well I hope these things don't happen again!"
30847,"I bet you are , So did she just purchase a new house?"
30848,"That is incredible , my dad had canswer and we had people from our church pray for him and others did as well and his cancer went into remission."
30849,Wow - that's a significant amount of time! How has that been for you?
30850,It sounds like you really care about her. I hope everything works out great for you guys!
30851,Oh my! I hope that he did not feel badly about it. That sort of thing is normal for children
30852,"Aw, I love that he had you there with him when it happened. I bet that made it feel a bit better for him"
30853,That is amazing! A parent will always love their children regardless of past decisions. How did you find her?
30854,That is truly amazing! I wish you the best of luck! And I am sure she loves you still!
30855,"No. I have kids, but they are toddlers."
30856,I imagine. I left my parents and my country when I was 25 years old. 
30857,"I bet that makes you angry , mine use to do the same thing and it made me furious."
30858,"HJow do you put up with it , I Know I could not do it."
30859,What!? What's going on?
30860,"That is very unfortunate, I hope things turn around for you my friend!"
30861,Why? Did he do something terrible?
30862,"Wow, he is super rude! Beat him up!"
30863,Dang! Do you look like your parents?
30864,"Yup, time goes by too fast!"
30865,Financial stress can be a major burden. How did you get over this issue?
30866,That is a smart and well thought out plan
30867,Would you be able to forgive her for such a large mistake?
30868,That is true. And the mistake would not happen again so you do not have to worry about that
30869,I can understand that. It took me many years before I learned to have complete faith in my wife.
30870,"The only thing I can tell you is to have faith in her judgement. If you ever lose it, it is time to cut your losses and run because it will only lead to hurt and ruin."
30871,"Love her while you can and enjoy your life together. Children grow up fast, i have two, a six year old girl and a nine year old boy. They are handfuls"
30872,Does your boss call on you a lot?
30873,"You should keep your head down, not make eye contact, and make a mean face! He won't call on you then!"
30874,That's really kind of you. What good customer service!
30875,You deserve a raise for that mentality
30876,Wow that is impressive! how long did you train for it?
30877,Oh no! did you get hurt?
30878,That is scary! I am glad you played it safe and decided to stop! there is always another marathon to run!
30879,Absolutely! And I am sure next time you will be able to finish 
30880,Wow! Did you punish him or anything?
30881,Well I hope he learns his lesson!
30882,"Why, that's not good"
30883,What do you plan to do
30884,result for what
30885,yeah you clearly are well read. what does he study?
30886,"Nope, it is too scary for me!"
30887,"Nice, I hope I can overcome my fear one day too!"
30888,"ah I was never much of a sports guy, but I do work out a lot. do you still play?"
30889,and now they're rattled around by 250lb guys smashing into you
30890,haha yeah. I'm worried about hurting myself by working out too hard
30891,haha I wish it was that simple
30892,Congrats!!!! It is an amazing experience! I just had a little baby girl 3 weeks ago
30893,Take it one day at a time man. It is a truly amazing thing. You will love that baby with all your heart
30894,I understand. Just be supportive as your girlfriend is probably thinking the same thing. Just remember you are now both in this together so enjoy the experience.
30895,Wow what kind of exams are you taking?
30896,Sounds hard! I hope you do well in your exams!
30897,That's very trusting. Did they come back with the milk?
30898,Good for them. Nice to know that there are good people left in the world
30899,I bet!
30900,Sometimes it can get tricky when family and money are involved. Did he pay you back?
30901,Oh man! I hope it all works out for you. 
30902,what'd he do?
30903,well maybe you should find another job
30904,Who did he bit
30905,What can you do to help him stop drinking
30906,Wow congrats! Is it a boy or a girl?
30907,"Dang, well I hope she has a wonderful future!"
30908,I hope there was a good reason for that!
30909,Maybe you should talk face to face with him next time you see him.
30910,I talked with my boss recently because I thought he was angry at me but it turned out he was just having problems at home.
30911,I am sure everything will work out just fine!
30912,Why? what is in that room?
30913,The same habit that I took up
30914,Really?  Have you watched any zombie movies or shows lately?
30915,"Well that might explain it, those zombies aren't very nice!"
30916,Cute!!! what did you name it?
30917,What kind of dog is she?
30918,I find them creepy too. I am actually very scared of them.
30919,"Oh no thats pretty gross! I hope that is not true, because if it is that is gross."
30920,Have you voiced your opinion to him yet?
30921,Parents always think they know best. Until their children prove them wrong they tend to think that. 
30922,What kind of e
30923,"As you're hopeful, you will get it"
30924,I'm sorry to hear that. are you angry at him?
30925,well you better make sure of that. tell him if he forgets again you'll divorce him
30926,you're very lucky to have such family! when are you getting married?
30927,"well , that's insane! i'm glad you find you life partner , and i hope everything goes the way you guys planned !"
30928,Wow that is a long time! How did you do?
30929,Exactly! that is a great outlook to have. You did your best and as long as you are happy personally all the rest does not matter
30930,Oh no! Have you ever had one before?
30931,"Yeah, but sometimes these things can't be avoided."
30932,"You are so lucky,i have been long for such a break for so long."
30933,You get relaxed and even get more productive when you get back to work. 
30934,That is amazing! It is nice to hear that things are going so well for you and your family!
30935,"That is wonderful! I wish you and your family the best! Sending positive energy, love, and light your way."
30936,Is it just temporary?
30937,Sometimes things are a necessary evil. And who knows as long as you keep your options open the perfect job may be right around the corner.
30938,"oh dear, that must've been embarrassing, are you okay though?"
30939,i hope that you didn't get hurt
30940,"Girl,you are so lucky. You got a good one. better things are on the way for you."
30941,"On my 30th birthday, my wife bought me my dream car. A Jeep. I never saw it coming."
30942,"it's nice to have someone who can help you always, i'm pretty sure she loves having you by her side always"
30943,she probably appreciate you so much for doing that. 
30944,That's too bad. I can't have dogs in my apartment either. Why won't they let you have one?
30945,"Our second family dog died last year. She was the runt of the litter, so it was a surprise since she was a small dog."
30946,"Ah, that's so exciting! Is he looking forward to it?"
30947,"That's so cool, I'm sure he'll love it and make some great friends!"
30948,Do they have any sentimental value for you?
30949,Well then maybe it is time to get rid of them?
30950,"Wow, did you fall on your butt that hard?"
30951,"That is unfortunate, but funny at the same time!"
30952,why are you scared of leaving your current job? if you have been offered a better job then just leave you know?
30953,maybe you should ask i think that's the easiest way of discovering what is better for you!
30954,What made it hectic?
30955,"oh, I understand. Was it a long interview?"
30956,"Uhnnn,most of us did!"
30957,What about the cats though?
30958,You monster! Everyone loves animals
30959,What have you eaten?
30960,You are living life. 
30961,"Dang, that is very unfortunate."
30962,At least you have a wife. Probably would if it weren't for fights over dumb things.
30963,Did you feel scared?
30964,Was the drive a necessary one to take?
30965,"Uhmnnn,you really did?"
30966,Did you have a sum inside?
30967,It's always good to have a boss you can get along with.  It makes work a lot less stressful.
30968,Yes a boss who is helpful and has a good attitude will have earned my loyalty from the beginning.  The better I feel about work the better I perform in the long run.
30969,"Tell me more,i would love to know!"
30970,Perfect state of mind.  I will take that any day.
30971,your friend is probably one of the luckiest people on earth. how do you feel about it/
30972,"well, you know everything happens for a reason. "
30973,of course I would
30974,What made you do that?
30975,Oh I hate group work for that exact reason. I'd rather just have company while I did the work
30976,What a shame. I wouldn't make them my partner again. (and I might venture so far as to notify the professor)
30977,I am so sorry to hear about your dog. What happened to him?
30978,"At least he lived a long, happy life. "
30979,i'm pretty sure they were more than happy to help you because they are your parents in the end.
30980,"see? they can't get mad at you so you shoudn't feel ashamed, instead search for another job and help them."
30981,You are so hyped for the day. I wish that will be the same for me.
30982,It pays to always be kind. Even if you don't get rewarded immediately but at least you helped someone.
30983,mind telling me what happened maybe i could help you?
30984,you don't deserve a best friend like that. or even a relationship where you have to keep fighting for the attention. i suggest you leave both of them and look for your future with other people!
30985,"That's great. I never did a long distance one. But my brother did, and it was about 400 miles."
30986,"She was a keeper though, I'm sure it was worth it for him."
30987,good for you. where have you been?
30988,what'd you do there?
30989,oh I see. do you have kids together
30990,Hopefully!
30991,"Great, what happend?"
30992,"Cool, I never played the drums. My band teacher in middle school tried to discourage playing the drums cause there are no notes!"
30993,sounds like a good adventure! where are you going to climb?
30994,well hopefully you won't die. be careful and make sure you have fun!
30995,I hope it turned out great. Did you find a good hairdresser to do your hair?
30996,"Oh, I'm so sorry that happened to you. I really hope you were able to get the color fixed eventually."
30997,"Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, how long have they been gone."
30998,Oh wow....I hope you can get through it.
30999,That must have been embarrassing. Did the girls get in trouble for it?
31000,I would have switched schools if I were you. I would hate to have to be with bullies like that
31001,Did she punish you?
31002,I hope she didn't make you feel too bad about it! People make mistakes when they're young.
31003,That's terrible. Hopefully things right themselves for you soon.
31004,The plus side about schools is that someone else will do something that everyone will focus on soon enough.
31005,Was the guitar okay?
31006,"I stepped on my uncle's fishing pole, kinda hard to tell if it catches fish worse or not."
31007,holy cow! Why did she go to jail?
31008,I'm glad y'all were able to make it through such a hard time.
31009,"Woah, I never had that happen to me."
31010,"Yes, we can truly not judge people because unless you are very close with a person you can't know their full story!"
31011,I am sure that was difficult.  How is he now?
31012,I am so sorry for your loss.  It can be a relief to know he isn't in pain.  I felt the same way when I lost my Aunt last year.  She was like a mom to me.
31013,How did the school feel about it? Don't they have strict rules about that?
31014,That's funny and unfortunate at the same time. I really hope your son was okay and not too traumatised by the experience!
31015,"Wow, that would have scared me, how did it go?"
31016,that's good I have 2 teenage daughters and dread the idea of leaving them by themselves
31017,"That's a really big change, are you nervous?"
31018,"10 years of teaching experience, I'm sure you'll end up having a great year! Don't stress too much."
31019,if you regret what you did you should go apologise for you said to him!
31020,i hope he can forgive you and help you forget about what you said.
31021,you'll need to be careful around me then. I'm the type of person who takes advantage of people
31022,yeah but maybe we'll fall in love instead?
31023,Why? What's happening today? 
31024,"Oh, my goodness. I really hope you're right and that the results come out negative."
31025,"You want cancer results to come out negative for cancer, not positive for it."
31026,thats amazing. where was the concert? and how many people were participated?
31027,cool!! even i wanted to learn guitar.. but have no time for it
31028,did he came back to take it?
31029,"you are a trustworthy person, glad he forgot it at your place not somewhere else"
31030,"I think a lot of people feel the same, it's natural. Is there anything in particular that you're scared of happening? "
31031,"There is a lot you can't control in life though. If you focus on the things you can control, then it might stop the negative feelings about things you can't control"
31032,I'm sorry about that. What did he do?
31033,"Wow, well he will have to learn his lesson before he will get a job or go to college. That won't work there."
31034,well I mean...does she really? or do you just think she does
31035,"well you should be more worried about dying in a car accident, because that's 10x more likely. drive safe"
31036,"that's great, what kind of job was it?"
31037,"That's great, my one son spent time in a childrens hospital and the care was fantastic could not have been happier with them"
31038,That's really interesting. Do you think it benefits them learning from you rather than qualified teachers? 
31039,I suppose as long as they're happy that's the main thing! It probably benefits them being around other kids their age?
31040,"I see, being alone can be fulfilling to. It all depends on the kind of person you are."
31041,"Yes, we can discover our inner worlds whenever we're alone!"
31042,why? i had the same thing happening to me with my dog. is she somewhere safe though?
31043,that's okay. you can always get yourself another dog.
31044,"That's amazing, It's always nice to get on with your family! Have you always got on with them? "
31045,"that's so nice to hear. I have always been very close with my family too, but I have friends who aren't and it's horrible"
31046,"Well, if you provided for your child's care then you shouldn't feel bad. I mean, this isn't the dark ages."
31047,I am sorry you feel so bad about it. I sincerely believe God will forgive a truly repentant heart.
31048,That's so good. How old is she?
31049,I know how you feel. Congrats on raising a young adult
31050,that's really nice - it's always amazing to have friends who you feel comfortable around. What was the new thing your friend made you do? 
31051,"Oh wow! I like getting out of my comfort zone and doing new things, it's such a thrill. Especially rock climbing - I had a friend who made me do it once too"
31052,"Do you hate when anybody tells you what to do, or just figures of authority? "
31053,"would you feel better if it was in the form of advise, instead of point blank telling you to do something? "
31054,"I think if you're confident in yourself, you can talk yourself into most jobs. You should give yourself more credit and not say you were lucky! "
31055,"I think so too! I think people should have more confidence in themselves, but you always focus on the negative things more than the positive! "
31056,"I'm so jealous, I would eat pizza every day if I could! What's your favourite pizza? "
31057,I'm not a fan of pineapple on pizza!! Pepperoni is by far my favourite 
31058,I'm sorry to hear that. What are you studying?
31059,It certainly will.
31060,That's an amazing attitude. Not many people are like that nowadays.
31061,Crazy world we live in.
31062,"Oh wow, was in unprovoked? "
31063,"Did you try to apologise before she hit you, or did you not have time? "
31064,"You must be having bitter ,sweet emotion.I remember my mom was also emotional when i left boarding school for the first time."
31065,But you can make arrangements such that you see him every weekend.
31066,I'm sorry to hear that. Did you apologize?
31067,"I think if you're respectful and state what you did wrong and how you'll fix it, she will forgive you."
31068,"oh my god, how embarrassing was that? "
31069,That is extremely loyal! You must have a really happy relationship? 
31070,It sounds like you really have had a good life so far! It makes me feel happy hearing good news stories like this 
31071,That's so nice of you. Hardwork pays
31072,"Oh yeah, you must be a brilliant student"
31073,That's so nice. Who was it from?
31074,That was really nice of her to get it for you. She must love you very much.
31075,Oh no! That's awkward. Are you able to laugh about it now?
31076,"Ha, that's good! I've had so many embarrassing things happen. We all have!"
31077,"Oh, maybe that's a sign to bring fun and adventure in your relationship?"
31078,"That's good, there is a lot of ways to make the relationship alive and interesting!"
31079,"That's such a shame! Were you honest with your friend, and did they forgive you? "
31080,"If she is that good a friend, I'm sure she'll forgive you soon enough. "
31081,sending my positive vibes to you too! Fingers crossed! 
31082,Oh I'm so sorry. Losing a pet is never an easy thing.
31083,I hope you have some friends and family that you can rely on to cheer you up. I'm sorry about your cat and I hope you know you gave it a good life!
31084,"skydiving is insane to me, how did it go? what reminded you of it?"
31085,"it's always good to have a professional help with this kind of things, glad you had fun!"
31086,"That's incredibly sad, I'm so sorry for your loss. How long had you had your dog? "
31087,Do you have close friends and family that can help to support you through this time? 
31088,"Oh, No! What caused so many innocent deaths?"
31089,I think war is universal. The causes are many.
31090,did they anything mean to you? 
31091,"oh, it was an accident, and it's alright. as long as you make sure that you use the right seasoning next time. it's all gonna be okay."
31092,How did you get into this situation? 
31093,well I think she should be the one to get you out of it! Otherwise perhaps you could see a financial adviser. They might be able to help you consolidate your debts 
31094,Well I have never heard of God helping with financial situations but perhaps if you pray and scrape together enough money for a ticket to Las Vegas all your troubles will be gone
31095,This is a lot to ask for. I recommend going straight to the pope for something of this magnitude
31096,Wow! Some delivery driver must be excited about their latest acquisition! 
31097,I didn't mean to sound so flippant. That is a lot of money to lose. Was the item itself expensive also?
31098,"Well, I hope they can trace it for you. Better late than never. I wish you good luck with that! "
31099,I'm really glad to hear that! That's one of the best feelings I think!
31100,"I very much agree! Being grateful is important, it keeps you level headed and grounded in life!"
31101,"oh god, that sounds horrifying, are you and your family okay?"
31102,"that's great, glad you managed to make everything okay afterwards, that must've been a lot of hard work!"
31103,"Oh, my goodness! Are you and your family safe though?"
31104,"That's a relief. You have the people who matter safe and sound, the stuff can be replaced in time."
31105,"Well,shes your wife after all"
31106,Thats women for you.Where you frugal with money?
31107,"Oh amazing! How long were you training for, and how many people did you beat? "
31108,"That's incredible, well done! I injured my knee a few months back, so haven't been able to run since then. so frustrating"
31109,"Aaawww,  I'm sorry you had to go through that"
31110,It is really hard to deal with  Especially if you aren't nearby. Sounds like you really miss your sweet beast! 
31111,Oh I'm sorry you are going through that. Have you tried to go back to your doctor and discuss making some changes?
31112,I hope that you can find a solution to help with that. Good luck!
31113,That must have been so nice for both of you. Had he changed for the better?
31114,"People do change a lot when they grow up. I met an old school friend the other day, and they were awful now! "
31115,"Oh that's so sad, i'm really sorry about that. Is it possible to apply for a loan again in the future for the same house? "
31116,that's such a shame. I'm sure something similar will come up soon though 
31117,"oh no, what a nightmare! Was anyone injured? "
31118,"That's good then, as long as no one waa hurt! was he drunk? "
31119,"That's cool, a good relationship is based on trust "
31120,Have you always been very trusting? 
31121,I like food.  What kind?
31122,That is a legit lunch.  Solid choices.  A+  would eat.
31123,Aw that is very kind of you. I love morning coffee!
31124,Haha! I think a lot of people can probably relate to that. I'm sure she appreciates it!
31125,oh no. How bad was it?
31126,I can see how it would make you anxious. 
31127,"Is it because you are surrounded by people most of the time? I get that way sometimes too, so I can relate."
31128,"It is good that you enjoy your alone time. Sometimes we just need a little ""me-time""."
31129,That sounds like so much fun! Were you scared?
31130,"My daughter got scared of haunted house once. It was hilarious, but I sympathise with her and you."
31131,Yuck! At least the cockroach isn't in your kitchen anymore! My cats like to catch mice and bring them to the front door.
31132,I wouldn't have been able to either! It's super gross!
31133,Oh I bet that is frustrating!  Can you report it to someone?
31134,I would feel the same way.  Perhaps you could mention it to your co-worker nicely and they will take pity on you.  
31135,What kind of vacuum is it? I bought a Dyson recently and I love it!
31136,Those vacuums are amazing and are one of a kind. You should get it!
31137,That's so sweet Literately. He seems like a nice guy 
31138,Nice! you are a lucky lady. 
31139,Oh I'm sorry that you are going through that. Have you discussed changing your medication up with your doctor?
31140,I hope one day you can find a solution and get back to being the old you.
31141,"Oh wow, It must have been quite an overwhelming experience for both of you"
31142,Congrats because I know you will definitely overcome the pains
31143,Wow! The struggle is real. I hope you're not too tired and stressed. I wish you luck for being so selfless! 
31144,"Do twins run in your family or are you just lucky? I mean that seriously, not sarcastically "
31145,That's awesome! You won the kiddo lottery! I wish you all the best of health and happiness!!! 
31146,that's sad I hate to hear that how long did you have him
31147,I love boxers they are so cool looking do you plan on getting another one?
31148,"Oh wow! Congratulations on getting promoted, that is awesome!!"
31149,"I bet, that's usually how it goes, but so glad to hear of your promotion. I bet you're super happy!"
31150,You are the best wife ever! I can't believe how lucky he is!
31151,What did he get sick with? I hope it's not contagious! 
31152,"oh yeah, did you end up passing?"
31153,I remember those day's and do not miss them
31154,That's terrifying!  Did they catch the guy?
31155,I'm so sorry.  How are you coping?
31156,You must have been in so much pain. How did you manage to endure it?
31157,It great you were confident despite your illness. It's a sign of good character.
31158,That is awesome and sounds like so much fun! What are you most excited for?
31159,I can relate! I love to tan and haven't had the chance to yet either!
31160,I really want to try Yoga! Would you say your back feels better? This sounds so fun!
31161,I'm jealous! I wish I could try it out for myself. How long have you been doing it now?
31162,oh that's awesome what kind of puppy did you get?
31163,that's too cool I would love to get a puppy some day
31164,That's awesome rain is good
31165,oh no. so what do you do in such instance?
31166,Oh my goodness thats terrible. How did you find out?
31167,I believe that's for the best. You should get regularly tested after this. I hope the best for you.
31168,"Omg, sounds creepy"
31169,I am glad you escaped it
31170,"Oh no, the dreaded fly being down for the big meeting. How'd it go?"
31171,Uh oh. I hope whoever saw it had a little chuckle then let it go. It's no big deal.
31172,That's truly heartbreaking. Were you able to help them? 
31173,Your heart was in the right place. It sad that children can't be fed in our world today. Maybe one day nobody will have to be hungry.
31174,So what happened then
31175,"OK, now I understand. Maybe she later got a ride home"
31176,Wow! How old is your child? That's very impressive!
31177,Wow! I can't even do that now! I bet you are very proud of her.
31178,That's unfortunate. Maybe you can have a chat with them about it?
31179,That must be so infuriating. I'd get upset if it were me.
31180,Congratulations! How much did you win?
31181,"Hey that's awesome. And you're right it doesn't, so live it up my friend!"
31182,"This happened to me! Don't feel bad, it happens to people such as us!"
31183,She'll forgive you eventually. You'll never make the same mistake again I promise you that!
31184,Has he given you any hints that he might be planning a party? That would be so much fun to be with all your family and friends in one place to celebrate you!!
31185,"That is a lot of people!! You are loved and appreciated! Now, its time to start planning his suprise birthday"
31186,Husbands can be so thoughtful... You have a good one..
31187,"Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. That is awful and makes me sad. Have you talked to anyone about it?"
31188,"That's what you need to focus on is just giving her all of your love, she will cherish it. I'm so sorry you're going through this, I hope that you can find peace with the situation."
31189,"I am glad, I hope you have a great day today!"
31190,"Wow, that's so cool of you. You really trust her"
31191,I really admire your love life. 
31192,Are you ok? That's absolutely devastating. I hope you have people to confide in right now.
31193,"I hope things get better for you, you seem to be a good soul. I pray for your lose."
31194,"I'm sorry to hear that. While diet is most of it, exercise can play a role too. How active is your lifestyle?"
31195,"I know it might seem like empty words from a stranger but just keep at it. Try as hard as you can to stay positive you will see results, trust me."
31196,can't you place a call to them?
31197,I just think you should just be optimistic and patient
31198,That's amazing! Congratulations. What was the policy that changed?
31199,Well that's great for you. Everybody loves a little extra money!
31200,I'm sorry that's rough.  Did you ever find out why?
31201,"I guess not, but I hope you still had (or will have if it hasn't happened yet) a great wedding!"
31202,That is really scary. Did he ever catch up with you?
31203,Thank goodness. Do you know who he was?
31204,"How close did you lose by? I bet at the next competition, you'll wipe the floor with them."
31205,"Understandable, when you put so much work into something only to be eclipsed by someone else. Not a good feeling."
31206,"Oh my goodness that is so sad, I am sorry to hear about your father. Are you handling him being gone okay?"
31207,"I understand completely. I hope that you can enjoy going to more games, and carry on his spirit when you go."
31208,Always!
31209,Oh no! That is really embarrassing. Hopefully she can move on from it and you can laugh about it one day.
31210,At least it wasn't something you did on purpose. I'm sure it will blow over!
31211,I think it's so weird that cats do that. It's like they are bringing us trophies or something!
31212,Yeah I would be a little horrified too if my cat did that! I'm dying of laughter thinking about your situation.
31213,That's so sweet. It's good to have that kind of faith in your relationships.
31214,Congratulations. I hope you stay happy always.
31215,have you called any rescue center yet?
31216,Lets hope it will trace the house back
31217,"Oh wow, good for you. That education will help you the rest of your life! "
31218,"It can be frightening, especially with all those new classmates and teachers. "
31219,"Oh man, I would have been really frustrated. Does she know he is dating you now?"
31220,It's never fun to see your significant other around someone they used to date. At least he is with you now and I'm sure you have nothing to worry about!
31221,I totally understand the anxiety. You never know if they are baiting you or actually giving you a good deal. Did you get a new car?
31222,I'm so happy you were able to get a dependable vehicle. I always have someone come with me as well. It's nice to have a second pair of eyes.
31223,"I'm so sorry to hear about that, it must be awful. Do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this? "
31224,"When my relatives have died, it helps me to remember the good times, and makes me smile instead of being sad"
31225,"Aw, he sounded like such a great friend! "
31226,"I am so sorry, that is so tragic. At least you have some good memories with him. "
31227,"That is so sweet.  I really commend people who treat kids like their own, it's so important for a kid to grow up feeling like they have a lot of people in their corner.  I have a stepdaughter myself."
31228,"Yes, it's true in life too when you grow up, sometimes the best family has nothing to do with blood relations."
31229,Oh no now that's a sticky situation! How'd you manage?
31230,Yeah hopefully all the hoopla over the first day distracted everyone. I am sorry that happened to you though.
31231,"Oh man, I am sorry! I have been there, it sucks! Are you okay though?"
31232,I am glad you are okay. I wrecked my favorite car 3 years ago and I still miss it.
31233,Oh really?  What was it for?
31234,"Oh wow, I can only imagine.  Paperwork is not fun.  I hope you got it all done eventually!"
31235,Thats aweful!
31236,Uhmnnn!
31237,"That is great, that is the beginning of happiness"
31238,"Wow, that is true love"
31239,"Wow,  that's lovely. So you will start keep fit"
31240,"It will help you,  even in blood circulation "
31241,Oh no! How did they react?
31242,What did you do? I would just laugh it off.
31243,"That's a shame, I'm sorry. Does she have anything to keep her occupied while you work?"
31244,"I believe that, a lot of people think because you're at home that you have time for things other than work."
31245,"I am sorry to hear about your dog passing away. But, I'm happy you have a new friend in the new one."
31246,It's good you were able to find new companionship in your new dog. Congratulations on your new pet.
31247,I hear you! Is she going out with her girlfriends?
31248,"Ahh, sounds like a tough situation. Maybe you should try letting your girlfriend know how you feel."
31249,She is a grown women so you cant tie her up or she will choke. I hope everything works out for you. 
31250,How mortifying! Did anyone hear it? Did it smell?
31251,Yikes! I can't even imagine how embarrassing that was.
31252,happy riding to your daughter
31253,please do Asap!
31254,"That's awesome, I hope he returns the favor as well."
31255,That's amazing. Love is absolutely grand. I am happy for you two.
31256,"Oh yeah,  I've been there,  I really understand "
31257,You will really have enough time to rest
31258,That sounds wonderful!  Do you get to use them yet?
31259,I haven't had a chance to try bath bombs yet.  But my daughter in-law loves them.
31260,Oh no! Kids do that sometimes. What happened?
31261,It's hard when they grow up. Hopefully she will learn from her mistakes.
31262,Oh no! I would be angry too!
31263,"Yes, they do. It's a season of learning."
31264,Oh that sounds good!  I'm sure you studied lots?
31265,That is excellent news.  You must be very proud.
31266,hey that's not too bad how long are you going for?
31267,"lol hey a week is a reasonable time to pack three backs, I would do the same"
31268,"Wow, how did that almost happen? I would rethink my options."
31269,Good keep temptations at a distance. You never want to mess up a good relationship over a one night stnad.
31270,Did they do a good job of cleaning your house?
31271,"That would make me nervous, you never know if they are looking through your things. "
31272,That helps a lot with the peace of mind. I am glad it worked out well for you!
31273,It is nice when they can build up that trust with you!
31274,That's a shame. Do you know who stole it?
31275,Did they take anything else?
31276,"Oh no. That happened to my sister last year. We were able to work out a plan, but she had to get a loan temporarily."
31277,"That's no fun, but I hope everything works out for next semester."
31278,"Ok ,how much raise did you get?"
31279,How much please?
31280,Too bad you've been let down so often. I'm glad your new worker is satisfactory.
31281,It's good to have someone so trustworthy. Congratulations.
31282,Do you still live nearby?
31283,It's good that you have pleasant memories.  What was your favorite thing about the neighborhood?
31284,Did you like it? What did you buy?
31285,That's too bad. I hope they didn't charge you for the items they missed.
31286,"I'm so sorry, you must feel terrible. It's their loss in the long run."
31287,I can imagine you're very angry. You'll find someone better.
31288,oh man that's not good at all! Did he break anything?
31289,oh that's really nice of you I am glad he's okay
31290,"It's awesome to have a partner like that. That's certainly why they call it ""the other half."""
31291,I second that. Finding that eternal partner is one of the greatest joys a human being can experience.
31292,Well I toast you to 10 more and beyond.
31293,Oh no! How awful! Did your Thanksgiving improve?
31294,I would be mortified!
31295,Cool! Where did you move too?
31296,"Oh, that does not seem like such hard work. It is fun to move into new houses. I like moving around."
31297,Oh good! So glad it is all working out. I will come by and say hi one day. Catch you later!
31298,"i understand, life can do that to you, and looking back always bring fond memories"
31299,"just think, today will be tomorrow's memories when looking back"
31300,Oh! Did you find any good deals?
31301,Uh oh...Was it tainted? I wouldn't risk it...
31302,Flag football is so much fun! What position would you like to play?
31303,You could certainly bring some physicality to the position with your height. I say go for it!
31304,that's really good... I am very sorry for your loss. It sounds cliche but it gets better with time
31305,you're gonna be okay. It's been five years since I've lost mine. Just keep her close to your heart.
31306,"That was so nice of them, what kind of pets?"
31307,Quite the little zoo.  What a great friend you have!
31308,I'm so sorry for your loss!
31309,"Oh, sorry to hear that. There is something going around these days. I hope they are better now."
31310,That sounds so sweet . Family time is the best!
31311,i know me too! Why are you ready?
31312,yeah it does! Great job man I'm proud of you!
31313,you are prepared more than ever !
31314,that's the spirit! always believe in yourself!
31315,"I have not, I feel like it should be done by a professional. "
31316,Oh no! Probably tons of years of dirt caked into the rug. Did you use the right cleaner?
31317,Maybe the dirt adds to the whole antique feel of them. 
31318,I hope you can find a solution that works for you!
31319,That must've been fun! What did you guys do?
31320,Oh that sounds like so much fun! sounds like you are very grateful for good friends! 
31321,That sounds like a really lovely way to go somewhere in a car!
31322,"On no! I'm sorry you were embarrassed, but I'm sure it sounded wonderful! "
31323,What game do you play?
31324,Ohhhh. What kind of game is it?
31325,"wow, is it the first time you're gonna see him? is he going to stay at your place?"
31326,sounds like you planned for everything! enjoy yourself! 
31327,"Thats awesome, never settle for less. Always strive for more!"
31328,"Well hopefully you can still maintain communication with them. It's normal to be nervous though, just go in confident"
31329,That's the best way to do it. Read before you buy.
31330,"It's amazing how dirty they can get, isn't it."
31331,"yes, my internet provider is notorious for that"
31332,"oh wow, did they justify the overcharge? i'd dispute it"
31333,That must have been a good thing did y'all celebrate.
31334,hard work should pay off nice to hear about some one getting back after they put in congratulations.
31335,"Yeah, my cousin actually borrowed my car to take his driving test"
31336,I don't blame you!  He should have been more responsible.
31337,"Omg, what happened?"
31338,Pesky snakes. Was it a black racer? I see those all the time in my yard.
31339,I would too! lol.
31340,That's awesome! Is something holding you back?
31341,Buying a home can be nerve wracking but in the end it's worth it!
31342,Wishing you luck and here's to finding the perfect home!
31343,"Sometimes I'm worried that I'm that family member, but I'm not sure what to do to make them have confidence in me."
31344,I'm happy that your brother is in sobriety now. I hope his life recovers.
31345,I am sorry that happened . I have 3 dogs myself.
31346,Good dogs are hard to vfind I can imagine how sad that must have been.
31347,I enjoy reading.
31348,It's cool that you're such a fan though. I hope the movie lived up to your expectations.
31349,"Oh, yes I remember those days too so clearly. Such carefree day, right?"
31350,"Yeah, it was like the only thing to do in summer. The whole town comes out and the pool is crowded! Oh, those were the days!"
31351,A what on the handle?
31352,Me too. About friends an d family. Things I got to see and do.
31353,Yes. Some more than others. But sometimes I think it's all relative.
31354,Oh no! How did that end?
31355,That's not good. I'm sorry that happened to you.
31356,Oh that is so selfish. Did you try and get back at her?
31357,"Thats great, says a lot about the type of person you are, in a good way! I probably would've gone for revenge knowing myself."
31358,Is it because you trust their judgement or is there a different reason?
31359,"That's great that you have that type of relationship with him. My husband and I approach things together and discuss everything, which works great for us. You have to do what works for you and your relationship."
31360,That's always a good thing.
31361,That will be really convenient.  There's one near us we like to skateboard to.
31362,Oh no! I hate that! So what did you do about it?
31363,"Wow, no power at home is terrible. What would we do without electricity?!"
31364,Poor dog! Did you find out why? Is it better now?
31365,"Aww, that's cute! I love older dogs, but I know it can be scary sometimes when they show signs of poor health. I'm glad he was okay!"
31366,Oh! What was it about?
31367,I hate clowns! when I try to run I sink into the ground.
31368,Oh no! I hate spiders! Were you able to avoid them and move your pots?
31369,If people knew it was because of spiders they'd totally understand. I can't stand their creepy crawly bodies!
31370,I have a friend like that. We lose touch but we will always be great friends.
31371,That's awesome. Now I miss my friend. lol
31372,Do you guys live far away from each other? I love talking with my mom about her and my childhood.
31373,Aw that's awesome. I bet he enjoyed getting to know your past a little bit better.
31374,Oh no.  Did he stand you up?
31375,That stinks! Were you able to get the stain out?
31376,Was the date at least good?
31377,That sounds like good news and bad. I hope you will be going with him someday. :)
31378,Sometimes our best life experiences are after we make big changes in our life. It sounds like a fun adventure to me. :)
31379,"Rain is relaxing to myself, odd "
31380,That's annoying! The weather team has one job. Rain is so relaxing to be used for showering. 
31381,That's a wonderful situation to be in. Are you planning to tell her?
31382,"That's understandable, but you won't know her position on the issue until you bring it up. Either way it's your call."
31383,Oh really what movie?
31384,I am so sorry.  Were you disappointed?
31385,"I love road trips, sounds like a good time."
31386,"Hope you have a nice trip, It's good to have things to look forward to. "
31387,That sounds relaxing! What did you watch
31388,Maybe I'll do that tonight!
31389,Me too!
31390,Oh no! I'm so sorry. What kind of dog was he?
31391,Aww. Mine is getting pretty old. I'm not looking forward to losing him.
31392,You think you will get another one?
31393,"Oh boy, I guess you'll have your hands full."
31394,I could understand that. I don't like crowds so lol.
31395,Thats good. Abusive relationships are the worst.
31396,Great! You deserve it!
31397,Yuck. Did you throw the remote out?
31398,They have a mind of their own some days.
31399,Did you get all of it done?
31400,That's why I wear long shirts. You can work. and not offend anyone!
31401,"Mistakes are made, but still. I can how that would be annoying."
31402,I understand completely. I would have done the same.
31403,"Wow, that must have been pretty challenging. Where you able to do it?"
31404,"Oh man, that's brutal. So close, but so far."
31405,That sounds awesome!  Did everything go well?
31406,"That's not too bad, I'm glad you had a good vacay and your friend is trustworthy!"
31407,Did you adopt an animal
31408,I feel all for those poor animals and want to adopt all of them
31409,It would definitely be hard.  I feel bad for them being in cages.
31410,"i am sorry to hear that, i know she will be better"
31411,"before you know it , she will be out and about"
31412,"I bet it was, I'm glad you are doing better now.  Did they find the person driving the van? Did they even stop?"
31413,"Wow, thats awesome you were only in for a few days.  I guess I haven't had an accident that bad before but I would have thought it would have been a longer time period.  "
31414,"Thats awesome, I am really glad youre OK now :)"
31415,Oh no!! Haha. The first days of school can be so hectic! But soon the routine will set in again and all will be good. :)
31416,Oh I can imagine! Glad everyone is ok!
31417,I would of did the same.
31418,It was a very devastating storm.
31419,"I hope so, no one should have to live throught hat"
31420,How exciting! You must be so proud of him. What an accomplishment!
31421,You definitely should be! Hopefully you took lots of photos!
31422,"Hahaha, that is hilarious! We have some mega spiders where I live. Imagine pulling some toilet paper and a huge spider the size of your hand comes jumping out. It happened to me!!"
31423,"Yeah, they can help get the spider outside."
31424,"oh wow that is cool, i don't think ill ever purchase a new car. a good used one will be my best option! "
31425,I have and infinity!!! its an older 2006 model i got it at a insanely good price around 4k
31426,I watched that happen. Been thinking about doing some research on trading with bitcoin.
31427,That's a good idea. I think there is alot of promise there. good luck.
31428,Yikes! I'd have jumped too.
31429,We don't have any roaches where I live luckily.
31430,That sounds awesome. It's important for kids to know self defense and also to be active so all boxes are checked.
31431,I may have to encourage some of my family to pick up martial arts. We never delved to the high levels and I see a lot pf value in the teachings.
31432,that sounds great you must be jazzed up about it
31433,"you'll be great, i wish i was there to see it"
31434,"Oh, that is terrible! Did you try to save the cat?"
31435,"Ahhh, what a horrible thing to see in the morning! Hope your day went well after that. "
31436,I've never heard of a hot water beach.  What's it caused by?
31437,Was that the coolest thing that you did there?
31438,Who are we talking about? I'm sorry you're upset. Maybe you could talk to her and let her know you need help.
31439,It's okay. We all need to vent sometimes. Bosses are the worst people to deal with sometimes.
31440,I bet it was! Did you end up finding it or did you have to cancel all of your cards?
31441,Thats awesome!  I know stores will typically hold onto a lost wallet but calling you is going above and beyond what the norm is.
31442," i must have been terrifying, I am glad you both made it through it"
31443,its nice to have another to lean on when it happened
31444,That is awful!  I can deal with dogs barking during the day but at night is no good.
31445,I really hope they listen and can make some changes!
31446,That must've been nice. I bet that reminded you a lot of when you were a kid. Did you enjoy your time with your mom?
31447,Ha! That's awesome. The 80's style was so cool! 
31448,That's really rough. Do you think he may have relapsed?
31449,"I would be too. Going through something like that can take a toll on anyone, and makes it hard to cope with everyday life. I hope he gets the help he needs."
31450,Thats awsome hopefully he sticks with it. Its a chick magbnet
31451,That's a great thing to have going for him!
31452,"Haha, yeah cats can be rude! I prefer dogs myself. They are much sweeter."
31453,Oh man! I feel for you!
31454,Was it a koala?
31455,I bet that was pretty awesome.  How'd you grow your eucalyptus?
31456,Well I wish the best for both of you
31457,That's awesome! Did she have a good time doing the play?
31458,"I now the feeling, I always had stage fright as a kid. Hopefully it wasn't too tough for her."
31459,"Aw, you must be lonely. At least you have her pet with you, right? What pet does she have?"
31460,"Yeah, cats are a little tricky. I think dogs are much more friendly, but that's just me! "
31461,"Oh man, that is terrifying. I'm glad you didn't get hit. What kind of crazy person tries to turn and change lanes at the same time?"
31462,"I know that feeling, I see that kind of stuff all the time where I live too. I hope you stay safe."
31463,Yes it is definitely difficult to change doctors.
31464,I definitely understand.  My doctor is not super close either.
31465,"Yeah, did something in particular make you feel that way?"
31466,"Wow, that's awesome! Good for you guys, I hope you have many more happy years together. :)"
31467,"Aww, I'm sorry. That's a tough one to go through. Mine had the same."
31468,"How old is she? I remember mine couldn't remember me me but I could still make her laugh,"
31469,you will regret not going I think you should go
31470,see you made the right choice and you will always be glad you went
31471,"Wow, thats cool. What did you do?"
31472,Oh! That's something to look forward to then! decide what your gonna do? 
31473,Cool! that's what I always do on my birthday too! LOL
31474,cool! are you going?
31475,Keep Mturking brother
31476,Nice!  Is that a perk of your job or did you have to use a vacation day?
31477,"Thats so awesome, is it coming up or is that something they offered when you took the job?"
31478,What's the movie? I love watching new stuff.
31479,"I'd love to see that. I was a big fan of Winnie the Pooh growing up, so I bet I'll love it."
31480,"Aw dang, that must really be pain for you. Have you talked with anyone else about this? I'm sure other people are having problems with this coworker also ."
31481,"Ohhhhhhh, yeah that's really hard on everyone then. Taking it to corporate would be a good idea to help the company and the workers, if you need to vent out any more frustrations, just let me know!"
31482,Oh yes! I really hate that. It has happened to me more than I like. Did you get a refund at least?
31483,Did you get a refund at least?
31484,"Oh no, that is so sad. I am sure it would of meant a lot for you to be there. "
31485,"I understand, funerals can be heartbreaking. But it gives you good closure! "
31486,Congratulations! That is always a great feeling! A reward after such hard work. :)
31487,This is very true and what all the great thinkers out there preach! 
31488,"It can't hurt to try, might as well give it a shot, right?"
31489,"The worse they can do is not hire you, gotta put yourself out there. best of luck!"
31490,Do you run into this issue a lot?  I could imagine grocery shopping to be a nightmare
31491,Does online shopping make it easier?  I would think maybe it would relieve some stress if you could do it from your house
31492,"I do!  It grosses me out, even when it's my own."
31493,I completely understand.  Hopefully the manager was able to take care of it for you!
31494,Oh no! So I guess you had to stay that way til you got to go home?
31495,"Well, I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself at least."
31496,That's just disgusting!
31497,I'm glad you were there to show that people still care.
31498,"It happens to everyone, being tired makes people so irritable. Being a mom is tough as it is."
31499,"Just give him a big hug and let him know how much you love him, and I'm sure all will be forgiven! :)"
31500,I bet you've had to do a lot of prep work.  Do you feel ready?
31501,What day do you leave for the trip?
31502,That's very inspiring. How has it changed your life?
31503,"Yes, I think everything in life happens for a reason and we can't change that. I'm glad you had your breakthrough!"
31504,What made you want to be a nurse?
31505,"That's good, it's a lot of work, sure you are ready for that?"
31506,Oh wow. Did you not want to go?
31507,Lol. Aww. I hope he is back now. Mine no longer lives with me and I kind of like the quiet.
31508,Did you have to get it pulled?
31509,Do you feel better now that you got it done?
31510,"That's awesome, I haven't been to a concert in ages. Who is the band?"
31511,I hope you have a great time! I should try and see a show soon so i can be cool like you.
31512,Aww! You must feel lonely. Is he coming back soon?
31513,Those must have brought back some great memories.
31514,"I haven't watched any old videos in a very long time, I'll have to see if I can find some next time I'm at my parents."
31515,I have heard the same thing from my friends who have kids!  They say it's like a force takes over as soon as the baby is born
31516,That has to be a very powerful feeling.
31517,do you think they are up to something?
31518,You should be careful about jumping to conclusions. 
31519,"That's nice, pretty rare to have good neighbors these days it seems!"
31520,You should have a beer with him or something to show your gratitude!
31521,Uh oh. Is he better now?
31522,"OK, good. What do you think caused the infection in the first place?"
31523,Is he a baby? I heard it happens often.
31524,"Aw, that's so sweet!  Do you see a future together?"
31525,"I really, really hope it works out for you guys!"
31526,"That had to be rough, and glad to hear you're better. Do you have any follow-up appointments to go to?"
31527,"Well, at least you have some relief for now.  I hope that it stays in remission."
31528,"Hey, good for you! That takes dedication. I admire that. "
31529,Losing a few pounds has such a positive effect. You must feel better too. I need to get on that!
31530,That's really exciting for her!  But I'm sure being apart will be difficult for both of you.
31531,Hopefully she isn't too far away for you to visit often!
31532,"Man, that really stinks.  Did insurance pay to repair your floor and cupboards?"
31533,When will your house be put back together?
31534,I'm so sorry to hear that.  Death is not an easy thing to cope with.
31535,It's a difficult way to realize you should live every day to the fullest potential.
31536,How exciting! first time there?
31537,Whats it like? I have never been there. 
31538,"Sailor Moon~!  That was the best show!  I've shared it with my kids, too.  And the laugh at the picture of me dressed up as Sailor Jupiter from loooooong ago!"
31539,"My girls think I'm the coolest because I watch Sailor Moon and Dragonball Super and a ton of other anime and I'm like, ""I've been watching stuff like this since before you were born!"""
31540,That's good!  I've got the ones that like watching anything about space.  The older one wants to be on a Mars mission!
31541,"Oh, man. Did you end up falling?"
31542,Ouch.  Did you get bruised up?
31543,I'm sorry to hear that she passed away.  Had she been sick a long time?
31544,Wow.  I hope she wasn't in any pain.
31545,I think most people have been there.  Its tough disappointing your parents and even worse when you know you could have done something about it.
31546,I got some bad grades in college and told my parents I was doing better than I was. I know how ashamed I felt at that time too.
31547,How much money are we talking?
31548,Fair enough. $100 can be made easily; a watch with sentimental value is priceless.
31549,"Hopefully, your hard work payed off. Where the finals hard?"
31550,I agree with you. Hard work tends to give the results in the end.
31551,"Oh, lucky! That is one of my favourite places on earth!"
31552,Did you enjoy it once you got there?
31553,"It really is. I've been to both disney world and dsiney land, I think I prefer disney land. "
31554,I know but it feels more....authentic or something!
31555,"That's really bad, what are you going to do?"
31556,Well at least you have a safety net. 
31557,"That's got to be exciting!  [And as a parent, I salute you!]  What grade do you teach?"
31558,"Oh, wow!  That does sound fun!  Just for the idea of eating in class every once in a while!"
31559,What sorts of things do the kids learn how to make?
31560,I wish they had that when I was in school in 199*coughcough*  :)
31561,That should be fun! Do you go every year?
31562,very cool! That's awesome you have that opportunity to do something you love every summer!
31563,"Yeah, lawn mowing sucks!  Do you have a large lot?"
31564,Maybe that riding mower would be a worthy investment?
31565,That sounds miserable. 
31566,Why didn't you ask her to begin with?
31567,That's good!  Was there a reason for the suspension?
31568,"It'll be good for her to have your support, so hopefully she'll do better this semester."
31569,Oh my god what happened?
31570,Did it get on him?
31571,"Wow, I'm sorry about getting fired, but it sounds like you've got guts! How do you like the business?"
31572,Oh that is so great. So many people fantasize about doing that.  Congratulations!
31573,Oh cool! Have they arrived yet?
31574,Yeah it
31575,I love scary movies!  What was it about?
31576,"I love her!  I'm definitely going to see it, thanks for the rec!"
31577,Yeah I hate when people do that. It can ruin things.
31578,"Friends come and go in life, it's up to you to determine if you want to reconcile with this person or not."
31579,Oh my. You are brave.  Thank goodness they didn't break.  Did you mom  know what happened?
31580,That's good. My mom would freak
31581,Sounds amazing! What kind of art does she want to produce?
31582,Wow. Sculpture. Very impressed. 
31583,Is it that time where you live? How do you prepare?
31584,Wow. that must make you nervous. Where do you live?
31585,What is the secret? 
31586,That's something she should know. 
31587,"Thats awesome, were they for school or for fun?"
31588,Thats awesome! Theyll come in handy on those rainy days or nice relaxing days!
31589,your are torn between him being a man but you still think of him being your little boy
31590,you will enjoy it as he grows older because you had a hand in it and know that he will be prepared for it
31591,OMG that sounds awful!  Was your friend upset?
31592,"Nah, if they were understanding it's all good!  Everyone has a little too much from time to time."
31593,He must have saved up quite a bit for that. They're pretty expensive
31594,Being frugal is always a benefit in the long run. I suggest doing online surveys to make some extra cash  ;)
31595,That's great!  How many dogs do you have?
31596,Awwww!  That sounds so fun!  And they sound like such happy little guys!
31597,Nope - school started for the kids today!
31598,This is the earliest they've ever started here.
31599,Oh that sounds amazing! were you a little jealous? Did they have fun?
31600,I completely understand. It does sound amazing though!
31601,I know what you mean. We are only lucky enough to travel local.
31602,Oh no! I am so sorry. That is really tough.  
31603,Did you get any feedback on what you could do to improve your chances next time?
31604,"Ah, that happens.  Again, very sorry. Maybe you can find the silver lining in it. Or, find a new job and get a fresh start somewhere else. "
31605,Wow! That's a good deal- I wish I knew how to find that!
31606,"Aww, that's disappointing. Sorry to hear that. "
31607,Aw I am so sorry to hear of your dogs passing. It's hard to lose a pet. We just lost our cat this year.
31608,It will get easier. Hang in there!
31609,It does. I just got a new kitten a few weeks ago. It helps to have her to cuddle with.
31610,Congratulations. Is it for something that you're keen on pursuing a little longer term?
31611,"Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Still, onwards and upwards. I wish you all the best!"
31612,That sounds sweet.
31613,Why didn't you?
31614,"They usually use their smartphones while driving, which is very bad for everyobys safety"
31615,"Yes, we as a community must teach people how to drive properly without any risks"
31616,"Congratulations!  That's awesome.  Sometimes it's scary to risk rejection, but it sounds like it totally paid off in this case.  "
31617,"I'm about to switch careers, so I'll be doing the interviewing thing soon. It's scary.  "
31618,Why do you feel that way?
31619,You sound a bit like me. I get lost in the details of things myself sometimes. I'm sure after you weigh the pros and cons of the situation you'll come to the right conclusion for yourself.
31620,"Aw, really? Was it a long time ago, or did you graduate recently?"
31621,I graduated a long time ago too -- 1985. Those were great times for me too. I feel sentimental about it.
31622,That's so great! I hope you get the job - assuming it's one you really want.
31623,"Then keep your head up & keep reaching for the stars! Maybe this will be the one!! But even if it doesn't turn out, keep on searching. Your perfect job IS waiting for you. :)"
31624,You're welcome & best wishes with your job hunting!
31625,"Mine went back to school today!  I watched the bus drive off and I kinda looked around and said to myself, ""Well shoot, what now?"""
31626,"Mine are older and think they're too cool for everything.  I took my usual 'first day of school' picture and I got, ""Mom, aren't we too old for this?"""
31627,"When they're little, that's the best age for pictures - they'll never meet a camera that they don't like."
31628,"The same!  17, 15, [girls] and 10 [boy]"
31629,That's so fun! I've always wanted to get into baking. How did the cake turn out?
31630,I bet you were so proud of your creation! I hope everyone enjoyed the cake.
31631,I'm sorry. I bet you miss her a lot?
31632,That must be really tough. I hope you can see her again soon.
31633,Wow!  Where did you find those?  I remember watching that series as a kid!
31634,It's so good to see old shows we grew up on coming out on DVD!  
31635,You must've been really disappointed in him. Did you talk to him and find out why he did it?
31636,"He better be! Sounds like he's in the wrong crowd. Hopefully, he finds new friends soon."
31637,You're lucky to have her! It's hard to find someone to trust. 
31638,"Aw, I'm sure you tell her. I hope to be that kind of mom when my kids are adults. "
31639,"Aww, I'm sure that's been nothing but positive for you. "
31640,Moms. They are the best. 
31641,Sounds like a great friend to have. Do you guys still keep in touch?
31642,"It happens to everyone honestly, I can relate. We will always have good memories to remember though, and thats what matters the most."
31643,Sounds fun! How close are you to your target?
31644,That should help with the cost then. How much money do you need to save?
31645,Those are the most fun sorts of essays to write - and the easiest.  How do you think you did?
31646,Wow!  Sounded like a real breeze!  What did you write about?
31647,That is very kind of you.  Im sure the owner was very appreciative!
31648,If I lost mine hiking I would for sure think it was gone forever.  Hopefully they didnt cancel too many cards before you got it back to them!
31649,These things take time.  Have you met any of your neighbors?
31650,Maybe you should try introducing yourself to your neighbors.  Or look online for meetups for hobbies that you're interested in.
31651,Ah. that sucks. Long commutes are miserable! hopefully you do better at the course this time.
31652,Yea those out of state fees can be ridiculous. Best of luck to you!
31653,Thats really nice of you.  Do you feed them too?
31654,"Awww, have you adopted any that you brought in?"
31655,That's great!  How do you think it went?
31656,"With that kind of confidence, you should be a shoe-in for the promotion!"
31657,Aw that's wonderful! What kind of dog?
31658,"Oh nice, they can be so sweet and gentle. "
31659,Lucky you! I wanna go there to.
31660,"It probably is, at least you get to experience another culture."
31661,not really I kill everything
31662,are they carrot flowers? 
31663,"really, did you tell them your secrets?"
31664,how did it make you feel to disclose that information?
31665,"Yes, everyone does. that was really brave of you!"
31666,i see you are a PS4 fan
31667,"i dont have a PS4, alot of people play fortnite. is that a cool game?"
31668,"Oh yeah, many times. Not a whole lot of fun."
31669,Wow. I hope you didn't hurt yourself!
31670,That's exciting!  Are you hitting up one of the amusement parks?
31671,"I have always wanted to go to that.  I love Universal, and Halloween is my favorite holiday"
31672,Were either of the dogs hurt?
31673,Your neighbor is very careless. Thankfully no one got hurt
31674,"really, what is the secret? "
31675,"wow, that is some secret. "
31676,"lol, right! she would defintely make world star. "
31677,oh nice! first one?
31678,I bet. Do you have any children of your own?
31679,so that means extra spoilage :P
31680,by spoil do you mean mountain dew?
31681,Thats awesome! I was actually looking for mine the other day.  Were you looking up anyone in particular or just for fun?
31682,I still see my high school buddies on a somewhat regular basis but it is a great time telling those stories over and over.
31683,"Ooh, sounds nice, Always good to see the siblings."
31684,"Hah, i hope you two have some fun. My sisters visited me a few weeks ago and we had some fun."
31685,"I didn't even realize they let you adopt dogs that failed the training, how did it fail do you know?"
31686,"Wow, I bet it will be a really good dog then. Hopefully you hear something soon!"
31687,Uh-oh that's not good!  Did they understand?
31688,Yeah you got lucky there for sure!
31689,"Nice!  Was he surprised, or hoping to do better/"
31690,That's great!  Which belt has he earned?
31691,"Oh man, that sucks 😢"
31692,"It's okay, there will be other times"
31693,That must have felt very good. And taken a lot of determination.
31694,It's great to have friends in the classroom. Are you still friends with some of them?
31695,"That's good. Sometimes classmates can make all the difference, I agree."
31696,That's terrible!  Are you repairing it yourself?
31697,"Can they be fixed, or do you have to get different cabinets?"
31698,No way! Thats awesome!! How old is your son?
31699,"I bet! Thats great news though, congrats to him!"
31700,Did you finally manage to find a house you like?
31701,I remember how frustrating house hunting was.  Glad it has worked out for you.
31702,"Oh yeah, school year starts soon. Well I hope you'll have an easy year!"
31703,"That's beautiful, looks like you've found a job that's fulfilling!"
31704,"That happens, you have to acknowledge mistakes to learn from them."
31705,"Oh well that seems improper, you should bring it up to her supervisor."
31706,"I hear that.  I can't afford all of them, but I have several.  Nintendo forever!"
31707,"I haven't got that one yet, but once I have a bit of spare cash I'll look into it.  "
31708,Oh no. You must feel apprehensive. You forgive yourself?
31709,Good. We all make mistakes. It's the human condition. 
31710,That's really nice. Did it make you recall any memories you had forgotten about?
31711,I'm glad you have something to remind you of them!
31712,That's so stressful.
31713,Yes it does. The DMV has the longest wait times. You go in first thing and already have a 45 minute wait from the get go. 
31714,"Sometimes it can be hard to be patient, I can totally relate to that. Not sleeping well can make you really irritable sometimes."
31715,"I hear ya, Don't be too hard on yourself though. being a parent can really test you! I'm sure you are doing fine."
31716,are you excited to get back to work?
31717,I'm sure the students are nervous about meeting their new teacher as well.
31718,That must be very challenging to deal with at times.
31719,I can understand being emabarrassed by that as well.
31720,You must be excited! Are you a huge fan?
31721,Sounds interesting. I do a bit. Not an avid fan though.
31722,Well that must have been nice!  I assume you wanted it and not something different?
31723,"No that sounds great, I don't go to the same places enough for that, maybe I'll get lucky someday!"
31724,"i hate when coworkers fight, it is so uncomfortable and you don't want to take sides"
31725,"i do not know what to say, i guess the best thing to do is let them work it out on their own"
31726,I love to look at photos
31727,What is your favorite memory of your birthday?
31728,Sounds like a lot of fun.
31729,I like to go out for dinner.
31730,That's not something that should be done in a meeting. If they're going to argue it should be done in private.
31731,Do you know if they managed to work things out?
31732,Oh no!  How terrible.  I hope no one was hurt.
31733,That is horrible.  I can't even imagine.
31734,"No, im 20 years old. Dont plan on having kids for another couple years!"
31735,What's troubling about them?
31736,Oh my goodnes that must have been a lot of fun! How long did it take?
31737,I bet. I used to have a dog years ago and have had that happen too.
31738,Really? Did you get up to see what made the sound?
31739,"Yeah, that noise would have scared me and I would have grabbed a weapon to. "
31740,That's funny. 
31741,What did you decide on?
31742,"That is a good thing to do, im sure you feel empowered because of that"
31743,"Funny how that happens, isn't it? Any memories in particular stand out?"
31744,That's great that she's kept so many! I bet your family will appreciate that as time goes on.
31745,What class do you teach?
31746,How interesting. I bet you are super proud.
31747,Im sorry to hear that do you have insurance to help you?
31748,Yeah well im glad you atleast have that to help you
31749,That's awesome! You are fortunate to have a mom like that
31750,Do you live with your mom still?
31751,"Thats not good, Did he do something to you?"
31752,Im sorry but you should still never hit him. It could just make him bit again
31753,Im sorry to hear that. Did you ask them why?
31754,How did you hear about what happened?
31755,"Im sorry to hear that, how old was the pet?"

31759,That is awesome we need more people like that in the world
31760,Yeah you are a very lucky person
31761,What do you think you can do about it?
31762,Busted thats good stealing is a horrible thing to deal with.
31763,Im sorry that happened. Did it atleast smell good?
31764,Oops. What did you bet about?

31766,Im sorry to hear that. did you hurt yourself?
31767,Yeah i can only imagaine
31768,"You know, I love cats but do you think it needs a mental evaluation or was it upset you were gone so long?"
31769,Well it sounds like it was your fault then I would attack you to if you left me at home all day with food! lol
31770,I dont think I would do that. seems a little odd to me
31771,Still that seems a little strange to do
31772,Congratulations I know you must be very proud
31773,Thats important these days more than ever.
31774,no is it fun?
31775,that is really cheap!

31778,Can you see it from your backyward?
31779,Im sorry to hear that. I dont like my neighbors either
31780,Oh. Was it because she didn't trust you or you didn't trust her?
31781,Well that is good. Not too many people trust their spouses nowadays. 
31782,"That is great, How far is he away from yoyu"
31783,Yeah that is pretty far
31784,I love Vegas what did you like the best?

31791,Yeah but where i live snow and ice are not really a issue
31792,Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you are feeling better. 
31793,That's good. And your girlfriend sounds like a real keeper. 
31794,Well maybe you should move closer to them?
31795,Yeah the cold can affect us older gents in some odd ways.
31796,"Moms like to do that, they worry about their kids!"
31797,"You should talk to her every chance you can, you never know when it will be your last. "
31798,That sounds like sooo much fun! I want to get a hot tub someday. 
31799,That is good. It's not good to be stressed. 
31800,"Im sorry, but you should still try to remain positive about it"
31801,"I know, You just have to take it one day at a time"
31802,"That is very odd, I wouldn't give them any of that information. He is up to no good!"
31803,Good call! I would of done the same thing. You can never be too careful! 
31804,"Man, I love when you can enjoy some good food from your childhood. It brings back so many memories. "
31805,"For sure, I miss being able to have my moms cooking. Now I am very far away from her."
31806,That is frustrating! Most people don't know basic trouble shooting skills. 
31807,"Yeah, it can be hard to be patient with people like that. "
31808,"I would be mad too, you should demand him to buy you more!"
31809,"Yeah, make him regret doing such a cruel thing. "
31810,Yes it has been a very wild and wet summer.
31811,I bet. This has been the most rainy season I have ever seen
31812,Darn! Why did you have to cancel? 
31813,oh my goodness! That is scary! I am glad to hear you are ok.
31814,"Oh no, that is so unfortunate and so unthoughtful of the other driver! "
31815,"Yeah, it shouldn't affect your insurance. Since you were not at fault. But who knows how the whole thing will turn out. "
31816,"That would be, I hope your insurance takes care of you!"
31817,"That is good, it is nice to be proud of the work you have done!"
31818,Now you can relax and enjoy the rest of your day.
31819,Its nice when family has your back.
31820,Thats always important anytime your in a dangerous siyuation.
31821,"Oh, that's nerve wracking, the waiting, especially when you know you are good for the job."
31822,"Well, this is how you get some, but having to deal with situations where your only choice is to wait patiently!"
31823,"Oh wow, was it scary in there?"
31824,I can't stand the haunted houses where things jump out at you
31825,"That is really nice of her, I wish I had a neighbor that was that nice!"
31826,I need to actually build a relationship with my neighbors. I barely even know mine. 
31827,Congratulations! Is this your first ever promotion?
31828,Cool! What industry do you work in?
31829,I bet. I hate when a few people mess up a good thing.
31830,Im sorry that happened.
31831,Awesome! What brand is it? 
31832,Neat! Did you buy it used or new? It's always a satisfying experience!
31833,No they are not in my area anymore. 
31834,Thats a shame they were one of the first stores I remember.
31835,That's horrible!  Was the kitten okay?
31836,Did you report the person to the police?
31837,"Oh, were you lonely? You must have missed him. Was he gone long?"
31838,"My husband used to travel on his job a lot. It was hard at first, but I got used to it after some time. Maybe you can get your girlfriend to come over?"
31839,Was she mad at you?
31840,Was she alone?
31841,"Oh no, is there any ways to stream it online?"
31842,That won't be fun waiting. But at least you can skip the commercials. 
31843,You are very lucky. I wish I was with my family.
31844,You are right. I always feel nostalgic looking at my grandma's old photograph
31845,"Oh no sorry to hear that , were you able to retake it?"
31846,I can only imagine. Its one of those things that would embarass anyone but it happens to us all at some time
31847,"Wow, it must be really nice to have your family close by."
31848,"No, my family is quite small. Is yours large?"
31849,Oh no! Did he make a big mess?
31850,Did you have to teach him a lesson?
31851,Neat! I invest a lot too! I have Century Link and it was up slightly today. Did any of your others go up?
31852,Oh gotcha! Well at least it wasn't as bad as the crash of 2008.
31853,Ohh cool! I am chief's fan. I don't remember that match. Who won?
31854,"Ohh you have a really good memory. I am very bad at remembering things, lol."
31855,Congrats to your son/daughter! They grow up so fast
31856,"No, I don't. But I want to have kids someday."
31857,"Oh? Do you know what they're bringing out next, or will it be a surprise?"
31858,Why is that? Too soggy?
31859,Please tell me you went through with it.  That sounds like it would have been an experience!
31860,"They've should have had similar feelings, so they should have been more understanding."
31861,"Ohh, i am sorry. How is he feeling now?"
31862,"ohh, that's so bad. It was not even your brother's fault. I really feel sorry for him."
31863,"Condolences it is very sad to lose a grandparent, they are so special to us"
31864,"Oh that brings back memories, my grandparents raised me. I am so sorry "
31865,I bet that was scary.
31866,Thats sad to hear. i hope he pulls through.
31867,Ohh good for you! You are very lucky
31868,I wish I had such a good co workers!
31869,Wow. You must be proud of him. Congratulations 
31870,"I see. It was many years of work. I guess his classmates were afraid o him, not everybody is black belt so young. "
31871,Yeah? what did you do? Do tell!
31872,Price we pay for beauty...I bet you looked amazing!
31873,Wow that must have been a treat for you to finally be able to get some alone time all o yourself! That was also very kind of you husband to do.
31874,"That is awesome, I know how challenging it can be to get some alone the especially when you have kids and there is no school in the summer!"
31875,That is great to hear! What is the achievement that you consider to be your best? 
31876,"Oh wow! Congratulations, that's amazing! Is your husband also a dancer?"
31877,That is super romantic! That's cool that you guys have a shared passion for dance.
31878,Oh no! Why do you feel embarrassed?
31879,Was the man nice about it at least?
31880,That's great!  Have you ever met?
31881,that's exciting.  
31882,You found nice memories. Yes. I finished high School 14 yrs ago. What about you?
31883,"Awww, that is cute. Is she married already? or are u married with someone else? "
31884,Ah what happen to you
31885,Be careful please do it carefully
31886,I don't fully understand that. I show some passion in my style.
31887,"Well, that's great. I hope that you show a lot of passion in your style, maybe with bright colors."
31888,"I'm sorry to hear that he passed away, but I'm glad that you have good memories of him."
31889,That is heartwarming. You are lucky to have had such a loving grandpa!
31890,That is great! Are you not looking forward to it as much anymore? 
31891,"That is great, I bet you had a great time because it is always nice to be able to ""escape "" for a week and just relax! :) "
31892,Good luck! What will you use the money for if you win?
31893,That's awesome. You could probably get a scholarship and go back to school for free though
31894,"Oh no, why do you think that? "
31895,"Aww, I hope that you two were able to discuss about what happened and how it made you feel. He may have not realized that he was doing that because there may have just been too many people there."
31896,"Oh, no. What?"
31897,"Eeewwww!! I have never seen that in real life, but just the thought is super disgusting!!"
31898,Me too! Do you see them in your home often?
31899,Are they not afraid of spiders?
31900,Why is that? I Too have had some not so good feelings lately ;(
31901,"Oh dang, Did she eventually find a ride?"
31902,Hopefully she doesn't blame you. Does she?
31903,"Oh no, would you like to talk about it? I really hope that you are alright. "
31904,Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. I wish you all the best and they are probably in a better place :) 
31905,"Dang, i can relate. Have you researched other wifi providers?"
31906,I understand that. its crazy how our tax money paid for them to improve that and they never did.
31907,"What you did is good. They need a lot of help. Not only money, but also emotional"
31908,it is good idea. You will be happy helping others. 
31909,"Onc or twice but i try not too often,"
31910,You are very trausting. What happened?
31911,What did you do was it embarrassing?
31912,"Goodness that must have been terrible, you shouldn't be so trusting of others."
31913,Good job studying. how did you do?
31914,"Congratulations! Tests are always hard, it feels great when you do well."
31915,"Oh, wow! Congratulations to him!!"
31916,It sounds like it! What kind of a job is it?
31917,"Oh man, that's rough. Maybe after he works there for a bit, he can put in a good word for you."
31918,Awww. : ) What secret is this?
31919,I will always be here for you. Secrets are for sharing with someone you trust.
31920,"You are such a good and patient person,you must really love him"
31921,I am such a lucky guy to have a friend like you
31922,That must have been exciting. Was your friend much changed?
31923,It is always good to see old friends after years of separation. It makes us nostalgic.
31924,"Flirting is fun. women enjoy it a little more than men do, I believe."
31925,Good. MThat can be devastating.
31926,That's so sweet. What kind of dog do you have?
31927,That's a relief. Is he usually difficult to walk?
31928,Oh my God! Are you ok?
31929,"Good! Life is unpredicatable and on the road, its not how you drive it's how other drive."
31930,Oh my goodness. Are you okay?
31931,I'm glad you're safe and the car can be repaired. Let the insurance companies deal with it.
31932,Sounds like a good firl. how old is she?
31933,Girls can be tough at that age. You are lucky ;)
31934,Congratulations on your graduation! You must be so proud.
31935,It's nice to have supportive people around you. It really builds up your confidence.
31936,"Nah, most kids that age are just trying to buy candy. it's much worse when you know fullly what stealing implicates."
31937,"You should, dont worry about it :0"
31938,Gosh. You must be anxious. How are you coping?
31939,Can I do anything to help? Maybe bring a few beers over and we can watch the game?
31940,I know exactly what you mean. Achievement and productivity then rest and relaxation provide a certain level of contentment.
31941,Glad I could relate my friend. Enjoy the rest of your day.:)
31942,That is so great to hear. I hope to be able to say the same one day.
31943,I am hopeful that I will achieve that. Hopefully soon.
31944,"Well, it will get better. Life happens all the time. We have to just accept it and move on."
31945,We all have embarrassing moment. We just have to just laugh and keep on.
31946,Why don't you two play chess together anymore?
31947,I'm sorry to hear that. I can only imagine how precious those chess matches were to you. I bet you look back on them fondly.
31948,Wow that sounds like fun! It does take a lot of planning but it is so worth it.
31949,I am so jealous! I hope you pack lots of sunscreen.
31950,That's very sweet. My daughters do that too.
31951,"Yes, it is. They can be very helpful when they want to be."
31952,"Oh, dear! You must be anxious for your colleague. I really hope everything comes out alright."
31953,You are a good and caring friend. She is lucky to have you.
31954,I totally get that. My sister does the same thing. It's hard not to feel envious even if you have a good life.
31955,"I have friends like that too. To be honest, I have dropped friendships over this. "
31956,So i safely reached home.
31957,I know what you mean. In time you will be able to ride again.
31958,"Have you thought about getting therapy?  Sometimes, it will speed the process of healing."
31959,"Yeah, it will not hurt. Can you go for walks instead?"
31960,That sounds like fun. Sometimes its good to get away without the kids. I'm sure they are having  a blast at grandma's house.
31961,I hope you guys have a good time and are able to reconnect with each other in new ways.
31962,"That's awesome! It's great to work hard, especially when you people show they actually appreciate what you do. "
31963,Exactly. I feel like that's one of the best feelings. 
31964,That's so sad. did you apologize to her?
31965,Forgetting is part of human nature. I'm sure she'll forgive you eventually.
31966,I am afraid of water too. I somewhat know how you are feeling.
31967,"I would be afraid of alligator. The water has so much pollution in it. But, then again we can't worry about things."
31968,That's awesome. I bet she is so excited.
31969,I can see where you would be shocked. I'm happy for her. 
31970,What wasn't a good experience?
31971,"Tell me more, what happened with your friend?"
31972, i can imagine how they felt
31973,"i hope they didn't get mad at you, some  things like are so precious "
31974,Congratulations! When is she due? 
31975,I hope everything works out well for you! That is so exciting.
31976,Wow. Your husband sound like such a sweet guy.
31977,You're a lucky lady. He must be a really caring man.
31978,You should ask them if you can tag along! I'm sure they won't mind one bit.
31979,Will it cost a lot to go on a tour with them?
31980,I think I have a problem with jealousy because it's starting all over again. What sort of dog do you have?
31981,You're so lucky. I'm sure you've earned that sense of personal enrichment. You deserve it.
31982,Oh that sounds like a blast! Did you go?
31983,Oh dear. This sounds like a bad comedy movie. What did you do then?
31984,"Ugh, that's really rough!  You shouldn't feel foolish though, it could happen to anyone."
31985,I hope you feel better soon!
31986,Did anyone else see what happened?
31987,"Dogs can get crazy like that sometimes, I'm glad no one else saw it happen!"
31988,"Congratulations!  Do you want to marry her though?  Don't jump into a marriage because it's what people expect. If you're happy as you are, just be happy!"
31989,Then go for it!!  Go buy that engagement ring and set up a beautiful proposal.
31990,"Wow, you must have trained hard for that."
31991,"I do marathons, too. Netflix. haha"
31992,I love dogs!  Did you find one?
31993,Oh man!  You must have your hands full!  I bet you're having a ton of fun though
31994,That's great news! I'm so happy for you. I've been with my wife for 15 years.
31995,"No, we had to fight through a lot of stuff. Just love each other, and always remember your not each others enemy."
31996,Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that.  Want to talk about what happened?
31997,Did they have major layoffs or something?  
31998,"Ah, the love is a cowboys fan?"
31999,"I mostly watch college but yeah, football is great!"
32000,I can totally imagine. Did you do anything to stop them from coming up?
32001,That's a bummer! I've always found drinking a bit of water and then holding my breath helps a bit.
32002,I agree. I think it is important for couples to be secure enought to be happy that way.
32003,I have been reading a lot it really helps me relax so much.
32004,Congratulations. Did you get a raise too?
32005,Thats excellent. 
32006,"ahh, I know that feeling.  Did you have a stressful day?"
32007,I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!
32008,Is your spouse jealous? Why did you feel you couldn't go?
32009,"It's a party with lots of people, not a private dinner. I respect and understand your devotion to your husband though."
32010,"I am so sorry to hear about that. It is very hard to lose a loved one but treasure the memories of that person, especially the good memories. "
32011,"Oh dear, I can only imagine please stop blaming yourself. I feel your pain."
32012,I stay home on black Friday. Too many people for me.
32013,I'm sure you will have fun.
32014,It is such a wonderful thing to have a mom who one can depend on.
32015,I wish my mom was still alive. Just make sure that you show her how much you appreciate her. Even though you were upset because you had to work look at the bright side.
32016,Oh yes mothers make our lives much better and gives us a new meaning in life.
32017,And also be thankful that you have a job
32018,Were you hurt?
32019,Wow! Did you have to go to the doctor?
32020,Was anything broken?
32021,I'm sorry to hear about that.
32022,Did this cause trouble for you at work?
32023,It's good that you don't let others bring you down.
32024,Just remember things happen for a reason. When one door closes another one opens.
32025,Just stay positive and always be thankful.
32026,It's good that you're confident. What subject do your exams cover?
32027,"Oh, sounds difficult. Good luck."
32028,"If it is a treasured gift, your friend should not be asking for it! how did you feel when she did ask you? "
32029,Did she understand when you gave her the reason you didn't want to lend it to her? 
32030,She doesn't sound like a good friend to me! 
32031,That can be very stressful. I hope you did well.
32032,I might try listening to some calming music. Stress can have a negative impact on your health.
32033,Who is Janie?
32034,"Aww that's great, dogs can be so loving."
32035,That must be really hard to deal with.   have you tried an aluminum free deodorant?  It helps me 
32036,I am sorry you have to deal with that.   I am lucky because I don't sweat that much.  Can't imagine having to deal with that.  I hope you find something that can help you
32037,I just moved to a small town and we don't have a Dairy Queen here. I used to go to one where I lived before.
32038,"It was always clean with quick service. The workers were always very friendly also. I miss that about my hometown, people are much more quiet and keep to themselves here. Are you originally from there?"
32039,Have you ever thought about moving to a different city/state? Do you think you would be happy someplace new?
32040,"I think i would like to move eventually, but for now i'm barely learning how to be independent, i started abusing drugs at age 14, now 15 years later im barely starting to ""grow up"" almost a year sober now. hopefully within the next few years I can experience that!"
32041,"I really do like it here, my city isnt quite urban but its not rural either, Harlingen TX, cost of living is pretty low here and i think the weather is always nice."
32042,What is your favorite Christmas memory?
32043,That sounds like a pleasant time.
32044,That is so incredible!!! Does he make a lot of money doing it?
32045,That's so awesome.  How old is he now?
32046,That is great. Not too many children are grateful of their parents. 
32047,That's great! They sound like they are very good parents. 
32048,Wow!! That is amazing! Good for him. You must be really proud and you have every right to be! :) 
32049,I bet he is! :) 
32050,"I can relate, feeling lonely isn't a good thing. How are you coping with it? "
32051,Losing the companionship of a friend really changes your routine. I'n sure you'll find another friend and you won't be lonely.
32052,"Wow, yeah I can relate. Being really high up is terrifying, but at least on a roller coaster it is only for a really short and fast period of time! "
32053,"Haha, yeah that is great! I am glad you enjoyed the thrill of riding one :)"
32054,I am great! HOw are you doing today?
32055,WHy?!
32056,Oh that is so great.  Is this her first?
32057,I'm sorry for your loss.
32058,She sounds really wonderful. 
32059,That is extremely sad. That must have been difficult.
32060,How old were you at the time?
32061,What a strange place for introspection! What did you learn?
32062,"Wow that's pretty fundamental to your personality, and a great thing to discover. I imagine the knowledge will help you throughout life."
32063,Wow testing that is hard. Glad you enjoyed it.
32064,"A ""U"" grade? yeah that's one that needs explaining"
32065,"Very cool, was it for a high school reunion?  Hopefully it brought up good memories!"
32066,Awesome!  Hopefully you gave them the motivation they needed for the new year!
32067,oh no! what are you going to do?
32068,Oh man. Good luck!
32069,"I hate it when that happens. I don't feel like it is necessary to flake,they should be sure before they lead people along."
32070,That's completely reasonable considering the distance you had to drive for no reason. hopefully another interested buyer pops up soon.
32071,"Aww what a bummer! I am sorry to hear that, there are plenty of more jobs out there though, keep trying!"
32072,"That does make such a difference, a job that you enjoy"
32073,That's great! Where did you get it from?
32074,Is there somewhere special that you are going to wear it?
32075,That should be fun!
32076,That sounds awesome.  Did you guys do anything with the day off or just hang out watching TV?
32077,Strawberries in cinnamon roles?  That might be really good!
32078,What kind of a car is it?
32079,That sounds great! What color is it?
32080,"Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. That is terrible. "
32081,Me too. That was very nice of what you did for that dog. 
32082,That's great. How did she do by the end of the day?
32083,"Oh, That's hard work, School and a job. It shows good work ethic though."
32084,"oh was he trying to be funny, or was he just creepy?"
32085,wow that is somewhat disturbing! I cant understand how people get such serious emotions for famous people.
32086,Oh wow!  Are you happy about the purchase?
32087,I would be too! What kind?
32088,"I have seen things I can't explain. I didn't stick around to ask, I ran. But afterwards I was thinking it was a ghost. "
32089,That's scary. I'm not sure what I would have done if that were me. What did you do? 
32090,"Wow, that's scary. And I would have probably done the same thing. "
32091,"Oh, I'm so sorry. How old was she?"
32092,"Yes, It's nice that her struggle is over and she is in a wonderful place now."
32093,Do you still draw? I was never talented in drawing.
32094,Oh i bet! Why did you stop drawing?
32095,"wow, i do not know either to say, way to go or you better not"
32096,"that's good to hear, and if your spouse finds out she would be proud and mad at the friend"
32097,Awesome! What happened?
32098,"I love days like that, with two gets that would be the best day for me as well!"
32099,That's great! Was it Kindergarten or Pre-School?
32100,That's great! Did you cry when you took him?
32101,"That's true. When my kids went to school the first day, I just kept standing around until one of the teachers finally told me I could go..."
32102,It's good that your standing up for your marriage like that. A lot of people aren't that committed.
32103,You are a wonderful person then.
32104,Did it make you feel frightened?
32105,"That's a shame, but sometimes it is good to face our fears."
32106,Oh no! Why do long? Did you walk?
32107,"That stinks, but I am sure you got to see a lot of nice scenery. "
32108,"Maybe he will understand, but just in case I'd make him a new one."
32109,"Don't feel bad, It happens to the best of us."
32110,"Oh, wow. I hate it when people do things like that. They should just be honest and upfront to begin with instead of causing drama."
32111,"I'm sorry it fell through, but hopefully you will find something even better, and bonus, you won't have to deal with her."
32112,Yea I hate the wait for aid and all the paperwork. Hopefully it is resolved soon so you can ride comfortably.
32113,Hopefully the car holds up. I think you are playing it smart by having realistic expectation of when aid will arrive.
32114,Cool. What kind of instrument were they playing?
32115,Maybe a ukulele? It's always fun to hear new music you like!
32116,That's wonderful! It sounds like you really care about each patient. 
32117,I bet! I bet that job would be a lot on your physically as well as mentally.
32118,Sometimes things come up. It's hard to travel during the holidays. Especially if your friend has kids.
32119,Maybe this year will be different.
32120,Dogs are really the best aren't they? They are the greatest friends we can ask for.
32121,He sounds wonderful and he sounds like he was a great companion and friend. :)
32122,maybe you had a good reason to do this
32123,i think he will fully understand and see it as no problem
32124,"Haha, did someone else eat the pizza?  Was that someone you?"
32125,"hahaha, he may have been a little angry but I'm sure he got a decent laugh out of it."
32126,"Oh, no! That's terrible! Were you okay?"
32127,I'm so glad you were okay!
32128,Why didn't you walk away lol
32129,You should of try to let it out slowly.
32130,"Oh, that's terrible. What did you tell him?"
32131,Well that's good advice. I hope it worked out for him!
32132,Oh no. Was it something that was in the family or was it something that you purchased. Either way I'm sorry to hear that. 
32133,I'm sorry to heat that. That's something that can't be replaced. 
32134,"That's very sad, I'm sorry. I have had family members pass as well and it is never easy. "
32135,That poor woman. Hopefully she is going to be all right. 
32136,Really! Did you have fun? 
32137,Oh no! That sounds scary. Some of the rollercoasters can be very well built while others are very sketchy
32138,"Cool, is there a particular country that you're visiting?"
32139,Were you nervous at all about the vaccines? Needles make me queasy. I've fainted a couple times giving blood and receiving vaccines.
32140,I've never heard of it - what's it about?
32141,So cute! I can relate to that on a fundamental level.
32142,That sounds great! Did you have a good visit? I hope it wasn't awkward. 
32143,Very cool. My own father passed away a few years ago. I miss doing things with him. 
32144,Thanks. I just wish we had taken more time to spend together in his final years. 
32145,That's awesome when that kind of thing happens. Are you guys together now?
32146,Aww man. Well be thankful it happened sooner than later.
32147,My brother just went thru the same thing recenly. He is so much happier without this girl he was dating. she was alot!
32148,I think he has already. lol
32149,Did you? Was it good?
32150,That's great. I may have to try it out.
32151,That's a great achievement! What book did you decide to read?
32152,Neat! I am trying to find so good books to start reading.
32153,"Oh, no! That stinks!"
32154,Haha! It's good you could see the big picture in a stressful situation.
32155,Well that was nice.  Do you normally walk?
32156,Have you stayed in contact with the person that gave you a lift?
32157,"I could have took the day off,but I went in anyway."
32158,Yes it was
32159,"I agree, cheating isn't rewarding. "
32160,I agree with that one hundred percent. 
32161,Time flies. Does this make you feel sad?
32162,It's nice to reflect on the accomplishments of out loved ones.
32163,Wow! That's amazing! You must be proud! What is your secret?
32164,You are so inspiring! Good for you!!
32165,"Whoa, that's pretty darn late! Did you ask her why she was out so long?"
32166,"Well, that's frustrating. Hopefully next time she'll think more about how her actions affect you."
32167,"Well Happy early Birthday!  I hope you enjoy it, when it comes. "
32168,"A special cake sounds wonderful, and you're welcome. "
32169,"Me, too! Do you have a favorite team?"
32170,"Yes, that's my favorite team, too! Yay!"
32171,"I know how that feels, and anyone who doesn't consider the safety of others isn't that great of a person."
32172,Speak up next time!
32173,Oh thats scary. I've been there. Just give it some time to feel right. Home is where ever you want it to be.
32174,"Thanks, it's so true. I've moved around alot."
32175,Yep! Dad was in the army.
32176,You too!
32177,Wow that must have been very shocking. At least you can keep it to remember her by.
32178,my goodness i feel terrible
32179,wow i hope it all works out soon
32180,What? You think you might be in trouble?
32181,Why in the world did you do that? I hope they never find out...
32182,"Ducks are really cute, especially babies."
32183,That's very nice of you. The only downside I can think of is them doing a lot of pooping.
32184,That sounds lovely!
32185,What a wonderful time for you and your friend! 
32186,"That's cool, what was the deal for?"
32187,"Wow, that does sound like a pretty good deal. Makes you wonder why it's so cheap."
32188,Neat! What typeof music is the concert for?
32189,Interesting! I've never hear their music before!
32190,Did you visit one recently?
32191,"That is awesome! I am so proud of your son, you should be proud as well."
32192,I can just imagine how you feel. It is so nice when our kids make us proud.
32193,That was nice of you. Is she feeling better now?
32194,I am glad to hear that. It's so sweet that you were able to help her.
32195,I have a feeling you got it. 
32196,"Oh, no, I hope you're okay!"
32197,That's great! I hope things keep looking up for you!
32198,"Oh, that is so sad. What kind of dog was he. How long did he live for?"
32199,Sounds like you had lots of great times together. You will have to remember those while you grieve. 
32200,I can imagine that would be very painful. Are you doing better now?
32201,"I'm glad to here that, I'm sure that moving forward after something as difficult as that is very emotionally difficult."
32202,"Did you get in much trouble? I was allowed to kind of run wild, so never had any issues with staying out till sunrise. "
32203,It's sweet that she was waiting up for you. 
32204,"Wow, it sounds like a great time with him!"
32205,Haha! That does sound like an amazing car!
32206,"Oh wow, I'm glad you have gotten your self prepared for a big blow. I hope you stay safe."
32207,Went through Irma last year. We sat it out too.
32208,Where they able to cover for the other employee?
32209,"That's good, I know what it's like when you can't get a shift covered and your just understaffed and scrambling the whole day."
32210,Congrats to your family! What an honor that is. May I ask the name?
32211,Absolutely. That's nice you two are close
32212,"Oh, you must be so excited! I have a son in the Army as well and I love when he gets to visit! "
32213,"Yes, I am. It's so nice to see our sons sacrifice for our country. But I think they do it more because they think they are protecting us. "
32214,"Oh, no! Did she damage your car?"
32215,I can understand that. I would be extra careful if I was driving someone else's car...especially Benz!
32216,my goodness so terrible
32217,oh i bet i would have been too
32218,"Oh, no. I'm sorry you feel lost!"
32219,"Awww, poor thing! I hope you find him!"
32220,No just go ahead and keep going.  It will be fine.
32221,"If they would have had you on camera, they would have already come after you for it.  I wouldn't worry about it."
32222,Yeah.  You're smooth.  You can do it no problem.
32223,So... was it cold?
32224,I'm so glad your dad was there to help you. Did he catch you?
32225,That's awesome! Dad's are the best!!
32226,How  deep was the pool?
32227,"Oh no! Have you looked up the user manual, or taken it to a repairman to get it fixed/"
32228,That takes some real hard work to fix something like that. I am sure it came in handy for cleaning up that stain.
32229,"That is true, being able to fix your own stuff is a valuable skill to have. "
32230,"Well, that's understandable. How did it go?"
32231,It sounds like it turned out really great for you. Way to go!
32232,"Oh, I love caramel apples! They're one of my favorite treats in the fall. Did you guys make your own caramel?"
32233,Sounds just like my family. Caramel is so hard to get right on the first try!
32234,yes. both good and bad. What happened?
32235,Wow that's so sweet!!! I love that they didn't forget about you!
32236,"Who did , tell me more"
32237,well thats not nice I hope she stars treating you better
32238,"wow, that must have been a surprise and a joy for you"
32239,"i can imagine it. no matter how old and grown your son gets, he will always be your little boy"
32240,Nothing like fresh veggies! What did you plant?
32241,Mmmm...you are making my mouth water. Juicy fresh tomatoes are the best!
32242,"Oh, no! That must have been so scary!"
32243,I'll bet you were. I'm so glad you had a happy ending!
32244,Hi friend! I am not sure who you are talking about. Who blew you away?
32245,"Oh, that is very nice! I guess he doesn't do that often if you were blown away. Seems like he loves you very much. :)"
32246,that is so nice that he trust you with such a keepsake
32247,i'm sure sure was. was it a special occasion when he gave you the ring?
32248,"Oh, that sounds so exciting! What did you make?"
32249,"Oh, sounds yummy! I love seafood. "
32250,Oh no!  How did that happen?
32251,That's horrible.  I hope you and your family made it out okay!
32252,That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you discover anything new?
32253,That's pretty exciting! I hope it sparks a lot of new conversations for you both.
32254,Oh no!! That is terrible! Are you ok? Will your insurance cover it?
32255,"That is a scary situation! Glad that you are alright! Man you car though! What a nice car, it is such a shame."
32256,Oh no!  Did he give you a reason why?
32257,That's terrible.  Have you said something to HR about this?
32258,"I'm so sorry to hear that, Are you handling it ok?"
32259,"I miss my father just the same, I suggest going and doing something you both enjoyed doing together. I find I feel closer to them in those moments, almost like we are still sharing them together."
32260,It'd nice you have a memento like that to remember him by. Did he wear it often?
32261,"What a great thing to have, I glad you're able to keep his memory alive like that. :)"
32262,That's so nice! He sounds like a keeper!
32263,I'm glad you guys found each other. He sounds like a nice guy.
32264,"Oh, I hate it when that happens. Makes you feel disorganized in your thoughts even."
32265,Take a day and devote it just for the house. That's what I do. I always feel so much better the next day that's not on my back.
32266,"Oh, sorry to hear that man. Yeah girls are hard to trust these days. What's up with that?"
32267,You did? Wow! What did it reveal?
32268,Wow! Good riddens to her! Haha
32269,That is terrible! I hope no one got hurt. 
32270,That's good. Hopefully your car got fixed as well. 
32271,I'm sorry that is tough. What breed was it?
32272,Aw! Life ends sadly. Have you thought about getting another cat?
32273,I love doughnuts. Did they have them?
32274,"I envy you, wish I was there to have some with a cup of coffee"
32275,Oh yes my favorite. I hope you shared with others.
32276,Awesome! I imagined he enjoyed it.
32277,Oh no! Did you end up finding it?
32278,"Aw that's too bad. Sorry to hear. I lost my debit once, I don't think I ever found mine either.."
32279,Scary situation loosing a card...Hopefully you get your new one quick!
32280,That's too bad! 
32281,I'm sorry to hear that. That can be a hard adjustment to make. 
32282,"Everything will work out fine. Stay strong, you're going to find someone that completes you and you will see that it was for the better. "
32283,"That's crazy, I can't believe your dog survived. Did you end up putting him down?"
32284,"That's really impressive, I'm glad he was able to keep living and supporting you."
32285,That's great! What class was it for?
32286,Wow! You must be very smart. There's no way I'd be any good at bio-engineering.
32287,"Oh, I'm sorry. I can image how you feel. My son and his wife are trying to get pregnant right now as well. "
32288,"Aw, that's so awesome! Congratulations! "
32289,How will you keep them out? It must be something that you can do.
32290,That's a good attitude. I wish you have better luck next time.
32291,Congratulations! That's awesome! How long have you two been together?
32292,Hah! That is a long time! That's so exciting for you though. I hope wedding planning goes well and is super fun for you!
32293,LOL that sucks. What are you gonna do?
32294,Hopefully he stays there and catches those rats!!!
32295,Do your friends not get along with your brother?
32296,"Makes sense, it's hard to bring things like that up with friends, but if you explain your feelings to them, I'm sure they'll understand."
32297,That's so great! What type of cat is it?
32298,That's amazing! Maybe you can plan to see her more often?
32299,"Oh no! That must've felt awful, I'm sorry!"
32300,I'm sorry you had to go through that! I bet you find someone better for you anyway.
32301,that's sweet. You guys must have a great relationship.
32302,That's great. How long have you been married?
32303,Oh nice! I need one of those! My couch is so uncomfortable. It would be hard to get out of a new recliner for me as well.
32304,Ugh! It's cool that she got a double so you guys can sit next to eachother as well.
32305,Nice that it worked out so well for you! What brand did you end up going with?
32306,"Wow, that's some high praise, I might just have to try it out myself!"
32307,Oh heck no! Were you able to get back to sleep?
32308,"Ew, yeah I would have been in the same boat. Did you go sleep on the couch after that?"
32309,"I suppose it is, but I wonder if the fact that you studied might have had more to do with it?"
32310,Well I am glad you got a good score. And faith is not a bad thing.
32311, it is a good sign of positivity i guess.. 
32312,yes.. only thing we should do is to be patience and the rest will be okay ..
32313,Oh really! What did you do?!
32314,Oh my goodness! Congrats! How long were you two together before you took the plunge?
32315,Oh wow! I've been waiting for 6 years for mine to throw a ring on this finger. still waiting! lol
32316,oh no what happened
32317,well i had one that did that and he lived to 17 so there may still be hope
32318,That's awesome. I've been to a lot of countries but would love to go to Italy. I am envious.
32319,That's pretty cool. I hope you get to go back.
32320,How exciting.   What do you plan on seeing while there?
32321,I am jealous.  I love being out in nature
32322,I had a cat named Barney too! We was a one-eyed grey tabby. What kind of ornament is it?
32323,"Wow, that's quite a long life for a cat. I'm glad you got to enjoy so many years with Barney."
32324,"That's not a bad response, how did the team take it?"
32325,"That's great, Did yall win?"
32326,congratz!
32327,That sounds bad. I know it wasn't intentional but what happened? 
32328,Well you did what you were supposed to do. It's their fault for saying what they said. 
32329,Why? were you mad?
32330,Oh no! thats embarrassing. I hope everyone was too drunk to remember. lol
32331,awe man thats the worst
32332,thats really sucks
32333,"Oh no, that's awful!  What happened to your dog?"
32334,Sorry to hear that.  That must have been tough at that age.
32335,"That sounds terrible, but I'm sure it's happened to other people before. "
32336,You shouldn't let one bad incident ruin water parks for you. You're probably the only one that remembers and still thinks about that incident.
32337,What happened? Did you finish the project?
32338,"Wow, that sucks. Sounds like it's your bosses fault. Did he take the blame?"
32339,Well good luck with your future projects or your future job.
32340,Oh no! Hopefully that is the first time that has happened.
32341,That is terrible! Especially since it was the whole day. Are you planning to punish her?
32342,Lol.  I love it.  That is a great way to remind her of why she shouldn't lie.
32343,I bet she won't do that again
32344,Help them move and then have them take you out to the brewery as thanks.
32345,I don't drink so have a drink for me lol.    
32346,Lol. Thanks
32347,oh man. was just talking to someone about that type of thing. i had a pet dog who was hit by a car back when I was in jr high. i have friends who have recently lost their lifelong pets and i know they're still reeling to some extent.
32348,i will indeed. thank you. back at ya.
32349,Wow! Do you know what kind of car you're getting yet?
32350,That's amazing. I bet you can barely contain yourself!
32351,i am very good
32352,"don't worry, I think everything will turn out right and your fears will disappear"
32353,Was she wanting to go with friends?
32354,"I know, you just never know how she will handle a dangerous situation. I talk to mine all the time about things that could happen. "
32355,pull what off?
32356,"wow, that is so nice. you both should be really happy"
32357,"yes, you have to put forth alot of effort in order to see good result. good for her. "
32358,That's a long time! You and your partner must really love eachother.
32359,I hope I have that one day! I bet these next ten years are even better than your last.
32360,"It feels good to be in a new place, but the moving process sucks. Is it a new part of town?"
32361,I get that. My city is going through that right now too. I moved to the suburbs and love it so far.
32362,"hey, how are you?"
32363,"16 hours, thats a long time"
32364,im doing well
32365,what cause the AC to go out
32366,"Me too, it is to stressing"
32367,"Wow, looks like you are extemely organized, no offense"
32368,That's good! It can sometimes be hard trusting others with expensive belongings.
32369,That's great! Did she teach you how to drive?
32370,"Well, it is good that you did not marry him. I had a husband who cheated."
32371,Consider yourself very luck. A leopard never change his strips.
32372,I bet you were embarrassed. 
32373,Sounds like you learned to knock on the door first lol.
32374,Did you mean rain?
32375,"I like rain myself. We've been getting a good amount here, during the past month or so. "
32376,We've had an uncharacteristically mild summer. I'm hoping it continues. 
32377,"thats horrible, divorce is the last result. "
32378,are the kids old enough to understand whats going on?
32379,i guess thats a positive. they can understand that their life will be somewhat different
32380,"I remember that too, it's interesting transitioning to a more independent lifestyle."
32381,"That's great, I imagine that you still missed your family while getting involved and having new experiences."
32382,That must have been frustrating. What did you do? 
32383,That made me laugh. And you are a great babysitter. 
32384,That's terrible. Did you confront your friend?
32385,I'm sorry. I hope you can work things out without too much drama.
32386,Congratulations! Buying a car is a big investment. What was the first thing you did when you got your car. 
32387,I happy for you. Buying a new car is a big deal. 
32388,Oh no! Did they stick around to exchange info?
32389,Oh good. At least they were responsible enough to that with you. I'm glad your ok.
32390,i love meat loaf
32391,"sounds good, what made you go low carb?"
32392,"ok, i do low carm too"
32393,You mean the kitchen staff?
32394,I try not to think to much about kitchen sanitation when I go out to eat. 
32395,Oh no! Do you have a suspect?
32396,"I hope it turns up, or is returned to you soon."
32397,"She's balling hard, I'm sure that her new toy will serve as motivation for you."
32398,That's splendid and it should help you decide if you want an interior similar to hers or completely different in the future.
32399,Awww. I'm sorry to hear that. Aretha means a lot to you I see
32400,I'm sure. She was a very good singer. 
32401,"Aww, my mom used to listen to her too? Did she sing along and dance like mine did too? Used to love that when I was little."
32402,Ain't that the truth! Miss those days.
32403,"Why, what happened? "
32404,That's a present that you love and it can love you back. That's the best present. 
32405,"Sometimes it's good to face our fears, or turn on every light in the house."
32406,I don't I think could quit without the satisfaction of knowing how it ends.
32407,That's awesome. My wife and I will hopefully be in that same boat soon. Was he excited?
32408,That's awesome. I can't wait to experience it.
32409,but i bet you feel all better now right?
32410,that's really good. Everything went okay?
32411,"wow, thats so awesome! make sure you take care of yourself"
32412,these months will fly by so fast
32413,Yeah it might be a good idea to tell him. But you may want to have the money to give back to him first. 
32414,Hopefully legal drugs.  But either way I think you should tell him and give him his money. But you know your brother better than me. 
32415,hey that's awesome! You won't have to steal money like me. Which University was it?
32416,Oh a Christian University that is nice. Well I needed my drugs
32417,oh okay that's good. I should apply because of my diabetes insulin is expensive. 
32418,Wow. Did the other person know what was going on?
32419,Well that's good. Sounds like it all worked out pretty well.
32420,That's good. I hope she found someone who treats her well.
32421,That's really sweet. I bet your nervous though.
32422,Sibling rivalries are unfortunate. Hopefully you two can patch things up one day?
32423,"Ah, i see. I hope you end up going and find a way to enjoy yourself. Family is all that matters in the end. "
32424,That's great. Any specifics?
32425,I'm glad things are on the right track.
32426,"Aw, that's sweet. What was it?"
32427,That sounds way better than the stuff I would try to make for my mom when I was little!
32428,"Oh no, how scary! What did you do?"
32429,"I don't blame you, snakes are scary! Do you know what kind of snake it was?"
32430,"Lol, yikes!!"
32431,"Hopefully far, far away!"
32432,"nice, its good to be organized before you go on vacation"
32433,i hope you have a good time
32434,good weather is always nice while on vacation. you are so lucky
32435,That is impressive.  Is he normally pretty handy?
32436,Thats so awesome! I want to get to that point some day.
32437,That's awesome. I'd be excited too. What are you going to get with it?
32438,That's fun. I just watched that move this weekend. I really enjoyed it.
32439,Is that uncomfortable for you?
32440,"Ok, well I hope it comes out ok for you."
32441,Congrats! Did they just come in and say hey guess what you're getting promoted
32442,That's cool. Guess all that hard work pays off!
32443,I'm sorry to hear that.  Do they know what the issue with his heart is. 
32444,That's good. I'm glad it wasn't something urgent and he got to finish in the garden. 
32445,Did your team not do so good? I know mine sure didn't.
32446,I like Chicago. How bout you?
32447,"Nice, I like them too."
32448,That would make me sad too.  Was there any reason she took your friend and not you?
32449,"Lol, well thats rude! Hopefully you guys are better now!  Little grudges like that stink, I like to just put them behind me and move on."
32450,Oh no. I hope that's not the end of the story. Did you find it? 
32451,"That's sad, hopefully it finds its way home. "
32452,"oh no, who messes up bbq"
32453,probably bad meat
32454,"Oh boy, was it someone you didn't want to talk to?"
32455,You can never be too careful! I've heard too many things in the news. Who did it end up being?
32456,haha good for you!  Where were you?
32457,my dear thats gross
32458,oh i bet
32459,Yes that is annoying! How long did you have to wait?
32460,"Wow, thats no fun at all. I guess you could look at it as money saved."
32461,Thanks! LOL
32462,very cool! how old is she?
32463,that's incredibly thoughtful! 
32464,Is it a stray or a pet?
32465,Well that's nice of you. Ive always been a dog person myself.
32466,Oh me too. Have you been saving up for a good one this year?
32467,Very cool. I'm looking forward to thanksgiving too. love turkey dinner.
32468,Yes family is my favorite part.
32469,ooh! I forgot about hot cocoa!
32470,what changed your mind about the car
32471,"oh, i can see why now youve had a change of heart about the car. thats awful"
32472,i would have been horrified
32473,Ah that is cool. Good to get it while he is still performing.
32474,"For sure. Not an avid listener, but definitely heard some of his stuff."
32475,Oh no! Did anyone come over to help or did you try to get out of there asap?
32476,"One thing I've learned is that it might be embarrassing for a couple minutes but most of the time, an hour later, nobody will remember what happened."
32477,"I do love new sheets. The higher the thread count the bette,"
32478,What thread count did you go with?
32479,dang. Good job.
32480,"Whew, always a rough time. How do you think you did?"
32481,For sure. Were they hard?
32482,Did you end up getting that job?
32483,Oh awesome. I would have been nervous to if it was something I really wanted. glad you got the job.
32484,Yes that's the worst. And I laughed when I read that. 
32485,That had to be traumatic. 
32486,"Oh no! That's awful, was anything valuable stolen?"
32487,I'm so sorry! I would be so upset. Did you file a report with the police?
32488,Close call! i would be pretty upset to lose my wallet. 
32489,"wow, lucky it got turned in with cash in it. Be more careful in the future! hah"
32490,Exciting! Were you nervous going in?  Did you take your test?
32491,Congrats!  That had to feel good!  Hopefully you're happy zipping around the roads now (and safe too)!
32492,"That is very exciting, I bet you are nervous for your presentation. A lot is riding on it."
32493,It is normal to feel nervous when working on something so important. I try to remember that it will soon be over. That helps me sleep. 
32494,That is scary! Have you been watching the weather?
32495,Rain can be such a damper. Make sure to be safe and carry around an umbrella if you go anywhere!
32496,"I'm sure if you can let people know that you're back blogging, they'd come back to see what you're up to now!  What do you blog about?"
32497,"That sounds amazing!  I haven't played tabletops in forever.  The last one I played was called ""Car Wars"" and it was at a New Year's party.  It was loads of fun!"
32498,"that is terrible, i hope you were not hurt"
32499,too bad about your car but the main thing is that you were not injured.
32500,"that is nice, family is fun to be around"
32501,i hope he gets it
32502,"Oh wow, I bet you were very scared. Guessing you found your way ok?"
32503,That's awesome! I bet you were glad those people came along.
32504,Sounds like fun. When will you play?
32505,Sounds like you will be well prepared.
32506,Oh my gosh!!! That's pretty funny. Did anyone see what happened?
32507,"Thankfully you had a sweater, but geez how embarrassing. "
32508,"Girl, take that drink and don't be ashamed. At least you wouldn't have to pay for the drink!"
32509,"That's when you say politely, I'll take the drink but not your number. Nothing to feel guilty about since you would be using your manners. "
32510,"That is really exciting, I bet it will be hard to let them go."
32511,"It is so exciting to watch them grow up, I am sure it will be an emotional moment. But it will be a good one."
32512,Were you looking for something in particular or just for fun?
32513,I bet it did! Were they photos of family or friends or all of the above?
32514,That is awesome! Congratulations. I can just imagine how excited you were.
32515,You made your coach proud and your family.
32516,How many years ago was it? What happened?
32517,Four years is such a long time! Its always the quiet ones you have to look out for haha.
32518,I wish you both all the best in the future.
32519,You must be really looking forward to that. Sounds exciting!
32520,"Oh yes enjoy the beautiful beaches and feel the sand between your toes,."
32521,Christmas is so much fun! Are you asking for anything in particular?
32522,Oh wow! That's a big gift! I hope you receive it
32523,That's great!  Congrats to her!  I bet she worked hard.
32524,I bet!  She's going to have so much fun
32525,"really, that is awesome. you will have fun"
32526,start planning now
32527,That is so nice to hear! You have a full house again! Did they have a good time?
32528,Oh yeah! I hear you! A house full of kids is always crazy. Haha
32529,i would have passed out!
32530,i would have ran to my car! and hauled butt
32531,Why? How much did you eat?
32532,"Wow! Was it good, anyways? Maybe you could buy more?"
32533,I'm sorry. I now that must have been a let down. Can you guys reschedule?
32534,I bet you did. Hopefully you can do something with her soon.
32535,I'm crossing my fingers for you.
32536,Oh no! What happened? Did you get into an accident?
32537,That has happened to me before too. The car started swaying side to side from the rear tires but I just took my foot off the gas and let the car do what it wanted until I was able to stop. So scary! I know how you feel.
32538,"Oh, no! I bet you were mad! Was she very sorry?"
32539,Siblings! You love them but sometimes they can be such a pain!
32540,"yeah, i love my little fur baby too, thats really makes me sad to hear that"
32541,That is daring! I do hope that you will win. What are the prizes?
32542,Okay well. I wish you all the best of luck.
32543,Oh no! That is horrible! Did you do anything?
32544,Good for you! Animals need people like you! Very heroic! 
32545,Oh yikes! Is your dog ok?
32546,"Awwww, I am sorry to hear that. That is a terrible thing to experience. I hope that you are ok."
32547,"I am so sorry to hear about that, treasure the memories that you have about your dad."
32548,It is such a good thing to have to have people around who helps.
32549,I am happy for you and hopefully things will get better.
32550,Oh no! What did you do about it?
32551,"I can understand that, Hope he was able to take care of it for you."
32552,"Aw, that is terrible. Hopefully you did not have much money inside. I guess the worst part is all the cards that have to be replaced. So sorry to hear this. :("
32553,Ouch! You know that you can replace all those cards online now. A bit easier than it used to be.
32554,i agree with you on that one it can be very frustrating seeing that all the time
32555,Yeah i agree 100 percent.  Its not a good look to make someone look perfect when in reality nobody's perfect
32556,"That's a big change, adjusting well?"
32557,"Nice, sometimes a change of scenery is good. I need to move out of this crap state. "
32558,haha I live in TN
32559,"Nice, i have friends there, i live in lavergne."
32560,That is great news!! ...... but a little scary at the same time. lol
32561,Well you have to let them spread their wings at some point. :)
32562,Well that's a good sign. He knows you probably miss him and he wants you to know he's thinking aboutcha.
32563,"Honestly, worrying about that kind of thing is human. Literally everyone does it to some degree if they care about the other person, no matter how secure they say they are. So you're in good company!"
32564,"Oh, have they done the draw for that yet?"
32565,"Oh, you would have been so excited and then disappointed! I'm sorry!"
32566,"Oh wow, I've never heard of a dog DNA test before. What is it?"
32567,That is so cool! Is it expensive to do?
32568,I bet he does. 
32569,Just sit him down and tell him.
32570,Don't be afraid! You are smart. You are strong. You've had enough.
32571,That is gross. Did you find out who left it there?
32572,The old tuna sandwich.
32573,Well hopefully you threw it out.
32574,Maybe it tasted good as well.
32575,"Oh that's awesome, how come?"
32576,I hope you enjoy it! Where are you going ?
32577,"Amen to that, food is better when you don't cook it."
32578,"omg, did you hurt yourself bad"
32579,"lol, i could imagine it to break the ice on your first day, you will always remember that day"
32580,"lol, too funny"
32581,"I'm pretty sure I've done something similar to that about a hundred times in my life, so don't feel bad, lol. He would probably laugh about it now if you told him."
32582,"What are brothers for, am I right? The absolute best response to something like that at least between siblings is just to get that sweet payback."
32583,Was it a good one? Did you keep it?
32584,"Is someone getting married, or a baby?"
32585,Well tell them I said Congrats on whatever it is. As long as it's not a baby marriage.
32586,"Keep it secret, Keep it safe...."
32587,"cross country, thats awesome"
32588,"im sure it is, this is when you put all your hard work into play"
32589,"yep, keep your eye on the prize"
32590,"Wow, how amazing of your dad! We're you surprised? "
32591,It sounds like your dad really loves you! To gift you something like that. :)
32592,"What type of cake was it. I love cake, wish I could have a slice."
32593,It must have been very pretty and tasty.
32594,Lightening and thunder has always scared me too. But rain is lovely. Especially in the spring.
32595,Or how about on a tin roof? That is the ultimate relaxation.
32596,"Uh oh.... I'm afraid to ask, how did it go?"
32597,I lent my credit card to my sister one time and it did not go well. She still owes me to this day.
32598,I am great how are you?
32599,"Sure, vent whatever you need."
32600,"Oh did you try them on? It's pretty normal, when my mom came home one day, she found me in her nightgown and highheels pretending I was going to her job."
32601,"Well, if you feel that's truly you be honest, and if they can't handle it find someone who can. "
32602,Do you feel overall that you worked harder than he had throughout school?
32603,I see. Do you have any resentment? Have you done anything to take matters into your own hands to get where you'd like to be?
32604,That's great. It seems like you've only gotten stronger and that's an important trait to develop in life. Be proud of what you can accomplish on your own and your independance!
32605,That's exciting! Are you happy to see him?
32606,How wonderful. I hope you two have a great time together.
32607,That's awesome! Is he a starter? I bet you were super proud of him!
32608,"Good grades, good athletics, he sounds like a model kid! I hope when I have kids that they turn out to be successful like yours. :)"
32609,"Oh that's awesome, Was she paying it forward?"
32610,It's always nice to get unexpected good surprises.
32611,You must've spent a while preparing. Did you get the job?
32612,That's so awesome! hopefully youre enjoying it?
32613,That's amazing! Where did you move to? Did you lose anything on the way?
32614,"That's such an unbelievably satisfying thing, isn't it? When you have JUST enough space to fit everything. I wish you the best of luck in Outdoorsman School. If I ever get lost in a National Park, I'm gonna be looking for you to come save me."
32615,How commendable! Congratulations! That is a wonderful accomplishment.
32616,Yes you should be. Giving back to communities is very charitable.
32617,I live on a farm and take care of many animals. :)
32618,Oh gross! Did it feel slimy?
32619,I'm sorry! That would be unpleasant.
32620,Are you going to adopt him?
32621,I hope so.  I always want to adopt all the dogs in shelters
32622,"Oh wow, so it was extra money that was not yours?"
32623,I hope she didn't get in trouble for being short $20. 
32624,"Oh wow, that sounds super fun! What color?"
32625,I bet.  I can't imagine anyone would mind having a car like that!
32626,Oh no! Sounds rough.  What happened?
32627,Wow!  That surely is frustrating.  Did you confront him?
32628,"Good, he better not! Hopefully the anger will fade."
32629,"Oh that's great!, was it a surprise?"
32630,"I'm very happy for you, I'm going to visit my mom next month actually."
32631,I bet it was way easier and less of a pain that you anticipated it would be. Are you ready for the rest of your work week now?
32632,"Nice! Well then I guess you don't have to be as worked about those meetings in the future then, huh? Piece of cake."
32633,"Oh really, like what?"
32634,Oh man I super love mario kart!  I played it growing up a lot too.
32635,"Wow, that is pretty crazy! What did you do?"
32636,That's very brave. Did you run into any obstacles?
32637,I'm glad things have worked out for you.
32638,It's always exciting when you know a package is on the way!
32639,I love eBay! I just found a doll that my daughter wanted for much cheaper than in the stores.
32640,That is thoughtful. Recycling is a great way to help the environment.
32641,"Oh, that is a bummer. Oh well, everyone is entitled to do what they want"
32642,The hamburger? Those can be tasty.
32643,"Oh, well hamburgers aren't the healthiest things."
32644,Why do you feel bad about it?
32645,That's unfortunate. Do you have anyway of contacting the buyer now?
32646,"hey, that sounds wonderful. a puppy?"
32647,"i imagine, all puppies are adorable and lovable"
32648,That's disgusting. I would never eat there again.
32649,"Oh gosh, What did he do?"
32650,Oh my god! is the child ok?
32651,"I hope you don't have to put your friend down, accidents happen."
32652,"Congrats, they can really scare you at the doctotrs."
32653,"Oh, that sounds like fun! Has it been a long time since you have seen him?"
32654,Oh that sucks! He doesn't sound like such a good friend I guess.
32655,Oh no. I hope it wasn't something dangerous.
32656,"Awww man, yeah the retail stores tend to change some stuff up, and sometimes it feels like you have to start all over again, but I'm sure you can push through! "
32657,"I'm glad it's not all different though. I'm sure the trainer will be really nice to train you because you sort of know what's going on, but just need a run down for the new responsibilities !"
32658,Well hopefully the 4 days did good and hey guesses are 50-50 right.
32659,"I think you did fine, even if you had to guess you probably made an educated guess, hopefully your subconscious remembered more. "
32660,Did anyone try to bid against him? 
32661,"Wow, did he buy anything cool?"
32662,"Haha, did you eat some ice cream?"
32663,"Uh, oh, I think you might have been in trouble the next day."
32664,Wrecks can be a scary thing to just miss. Was it the other persons fault?
32665,Split second decisions save lives 
32666,Thats cool. The N64 was a huge step up for enjoying your alone time for me.
32667,I sold mine a long time ago and i regret it. :(
32668,I should do that i don't know why i haven't
32669,Done! lol
32670,Oh no. Did they catch the person?
32671,It's good that they were unsuccessful at least.
32672,"Haha bikes can be very scary. Did you lean the wrong why, i did that my first time."
32673,Oh nice! He sounds like a cool dude. haha
32674,Bike's are a lot of fun i can see why he would be into them.
32675,"Oh gosh, about what?"
32676,"Oh no. So it was a horror movie, right?"
32677,"Ugh. I hate horror movies.. I swear, I could be a grown 50 year old man, and still have trouble sleeping because of horror movies!!"
32678,that was brave of her
32679,"wow, she must be really good. to quit herself. "
32680,"Everyone feels that way when comparing themselves at those things. Except the pompous ones from school, those guys suck haha."
32681,"Ohhh, I am sorry to hear that. I know your pain very well. Are you ok?"
32682,That is good. It sounds like you were able to be with her before she left. She is in a better place now.
32683,"I'm so sorry to hear about your father. That's so awesome to hear about the support you received, though!"
32684,WOW! That's incredible! What an awesome human being
32685,Anything you have in mind for you?
32686,Well I hope your wants come to fruition .
32687,Haha why is that? Do you already have too many?
32688,Ah screw them. Live your own lives. 
32689,Aw I hate when that happens. Did they have a valid excuse to cancel?
32690,Well hopefully you can get together with them again soon. I know it stinks to get excited about plans and then have them fall through.
32691,Yea being alone can really get to someone head.
32692,Thats good! Have you thought about getting an outside job?
32693,Well six months is a long time maybe you could get a seasonal job.
32694,Haha that could be fun! Like a haunted house one.
32695,"My mom can too, What did she do?"
32696,"Sometimes our mothers forget, that you are adult and thats not her child."
32697,Would you?
32698,Arent they all!
32699,OH NO! Will he/she be ok?
32700,OHH i thought you literally left her. Haha idk why.
32701,LOL. Toots haha
32702,That's awesome! I'm sure you are proud.
32703,"It takes commitment and sacrifice, hell I'm proud of your brother too! "
32704,That is terrible. Did you complain to the company and get a discount?
32705,"Yeah, moving can be so stressful and expensive sometimes."
32706,Oh my gosh! It isn't your fault!!!
32707,I have ran over animals as well. It is an unfortunate reality.
32708,Do they understand it was an accident?
32709,It could be much worse. They could blame you and you would feel even worse. You should feel better with time.
32710,Oh how exciting! Where are you going?
32711,You are going to have such a great time and make memories you will cherish the rest of your life
32712,You enjoy it a lot of people never travel so be thankful for the experience and soak up everything like a sponge
32713,"I would agree that you do, enjoy your trip!"
32714,Where did you eat? And what happened?
32715,I hate when that happens.
32716,That sounds like a good game to watch! Did you have your friends over?
32717,I can imagine! Watching games can get wild sometimes!
32718,That is excellent!  In what subject?
32719,Wow.  That sounds like an interesting subject
32720,"Oh my goodness, that must have been embarrassing"
32721,"I'm sure people looked away, it could have been them"
32722,O yeah what did they teach you?
32723,O that is called a trust fall i think. it is used for team building
32724,What kind of car?
32725,Perhaps he's a meth dealer.
32726,"Well maybe you can too one day , I hope you do at the very least."
32727,That's what my friends told me when we moved to Colorado for school. Free couchrides for life.
32728,oh very cool. I have never been to Colorado. I keep saying i want to go but never do. Maybe for GABF in a couple years. Who knows.
32729,i've heard that. i'd be coming north from Austin so easy enough to avoid cow smell :D

32735,You should celebrate with a drink or a nice dinner out maybe

32744,I hope you are accepted. How do you feel as far as your application looked?
32745,"I wish you good luck, what kind of job is it?"
32746,"Marketing is a rough business, but once you get your foot in the door, work hard , but dont let it consume your life."
32747,I dont think I could do that its way to scary for me
32748,It just seems like something could go wrong. You are a lot braver than me my firend
32749,Sounds like your dog had fun.
32750,It's good that you are able to discipline your dog.
32751,"sorry for your loss, why were you angry with him?"
32752,its natural to have those emotions
32753,"I bet that meant a lot to you , and him as well."
32754,"Well cherish them, and what they represent, and you will be awesome."
32755,Why was she yelling at the cashier?
32756,I feel a little bad for the cashier.
32757,I agree. So many people are inconsiderate of workers.

32759,I am sure you will. It could take awhile but im sure he will make enough to pay you back. or is it a she?
32760,Oh nice! Good man! You are a good friend!
32761,I am sure that knarma is coming back soon ;)
32762,That can be weird. Lots of memories.
32763,Sometimes it's good to reminisce.
32764,why were you so nervous
32765,noone knew that you were moving?
32766,"oh, that has to be scary"
32767,"here you are, killing it"
32768,How is the kid handling it? 
32769,"Tried and true, what generation of goldfish is this one?"
32770,atleast it is nt a hampster with specific markings
32771,That's really cute! Were they the same age?
32772,My children are getting older
32773,My son is fifteen. 
32774,Oh yes. I actually ordered him a Lyft the other day to get from one friends house to another. I wasn't worried though. I think the system is solid.
32775,What were they worried about?
32776,Lol i think thats the 21rst centurl. its funny back in the day they said don't get in strangers cars.
32777,Yea he will be fine.
32778,That's amazing for someone that age. And his voice was still good?
32779,That's so sweet! What kind of necklace is it?
32780,Neat! Did he find it while metal detecting? What a treasure that is! It had a double meaning to him!
32781,That's quite generous! Cremations are expensive these days. I'm also sorry for your loss!
32782,Having someone like that to turn to in times of need can ease the burden.
32783,Oh nice!  What kind of toys?
32784,That is nice.  Remembering childhood can be fun
32785,He is a great play-writer. What do you like best? 
32786,All great stories. I want to visit the Globe Theater sometime in my life. 
32787,Cool! I like cookies! What did you have in snacks?
32788,"wow. ha ha. It's been a long time since I haven't had sour patch. I used to have it, when I was a kid. You seem enjoying your life ha!"
32789,Oh no! We're you okay?
32790,"Ha ha, you poor thing. Hopefully you feel better soon!"
32791,"ohh, that's bad. But, you will be fine. Don't worry!"

32793,I didnt I was busy at work. Who won?
32794,That is good to hear! Do you think they can do it again next year?
32795,Did you end up getting them to for you?
32796,Wow sorry to hear that. 
32797,"It's a big step for anyone, and can really make you feel like you have something tangible you worked for."
32798,"No, Where I live in Colorado , it would be the size of a match box for way too much money."
32799,That is sad. Were you in the running for the job?
32800,"Oh. Well that makes sense,I supposed. Still sad. "
32801,You should at least clear the air with him so that you dont have hard feelings
32802,Yeah but it happens and you should both try to move forward
32803,Aww that is really sweet! how did her do it?
32804,I think he might be the one for you!
32805,Oh gosh. That's awful... sorry you had to experience that. What did you do after finding it? 
32806,"Aww. I wonder how he died.. poor raccoon. Even if they are sneaky little creatures, it's pretty sad. "
32807,Did you go with her anyway?
32808,I understand that.
32809,Oh dear. Were you late?
32810,That is sad. I hope everything turned out okay. 
32811,"Did you trip on something, or injure yourself?"
32812,"It happens to everyone at some point, Ignore the jerks and know that they will forget about it for the next thing that comes along."
32813,ooh cool! Did you win?
32814,You did good! There is always a luck factor involved.
32815,That's so annoying. I hate traffic! Was there an accident or was it just rush hour?
32816,"That's the worst. Where I live, there's insane traffic from 3 PM to 6 PM pretty much everyday! But people don't honk or yell, that's just being hostile!"
32817,Yeah were i live he had roads closed for weeks trying to fix everything
32818,Yeah i hope we dont get another one of those again
32819,"Oh, I don't like surprises. What did you do?"
32820,Tough love works sometimes.
32821,"A few times before, but not recently. I do love Fifa the game though."
32822,"Well maybe next year they will fix the issues the club had, and come back stronger."
32823,"ohh good, and how did that happen?"
32824,Ohh that's bad though. Why don't you meet her?
32825,Does his phone not work or something?
32826,Well if you are really worried maybe call the police and have them do a wellness check
32827,lol i bet it was good
32828,sometimes it tastes better when it naughty
32829,Congratulations! Are you happy to be done?
32830,That's wonderful. I bet it feels great to have all your hard work finally pay off.
32831,O yeah? What did you find?
32832,O man I still have my furby too! I love looking at my old toys
32833,"That's awesome, I was in Chorus as a kid. Did she nail it?"
32834,Hopefully they made a taping of it for you to have.
32835,That's weird. Are they friends?
32836,"Oh, wow. I bet you were upset. Are you going to ask him about it?"
32837,I'm sorry you are going through this.
32838,Like the kind a cat vomits or came off of a brush? I'm hoping for you it came from a brush
32839,Oh my goodness for a lack of better terms! I would be no good after that
32840,"Oh man, I hope everything is ok , and it was something mildly annoying like a tree limb."
32841,"My dog would of looked around like, wasn't me daddy, i cross my paws."
32842,Somethimes that is good it keeps you on pace
32843,Yeah but try to enjoy the journey that is the most important part
32844,I like watching movies with karate in them.
32845,Thats awesome. How long did it last?
32846,The wait is always the worst. I will keep you in my thoughts.
32847,I hope its good news!
32848,Oh no! Was it a spider?
32849,"Oh boy, that's even worse than a spider! Run!"
32850,"That's terrible, I hope you apologized, or at least returned it and it was stolen for a good reason."
32851,Well you should if it's weighing on you.
32852,What was wrong with it?
32853,Oh that's so gross! I would have sent it back too
32854,Its always disappointing to not achieve something you were hoping for but it could also mean that a better position is in store for you.
32855,"I am sure with that attitude that you will move up the ladder very soon, much luck."
32856,I am sorry to hear that will you still be needed for your job?
32857,Thats great I am sure you will achieve success there.
32858,What was it like I have always wanted to live in a dorm and go to colledge?
32859,Well you should have why didn't you?
32860,"Oh no, you must be devastated. Wish I could give you a hug."
32861,It's tough to lose someone you love. 
32862,I'm so sorry! Losing a pet is like losing family.
32863,You'll always have those memories of you and him together to cherish!
32864,I'm tired but otherwise great.
32865,Jumped out of an airplane?
32866,Uh oh.  What happened?
32867,Wow!  Are you ok?  Is she ok?
32868,Omg.  I'm glad you're both ok.  That had to be scary.  She deserves extra love.  What a good dog.
32869,I'll bring you both something special next time I'm over.  So glad you had her there.  Wish she didn't get hurt though.
32870,"Yikes, I had when that happens. Do you live with this guy?"
32871,Good for you! Get it done!
32872,Congrats! how long have you been together?
32873,That is kinda odd but im glad you are happy!
32874,That's not fair! Does it go on your property?
32875,I see. Have you tried talking to your neighbor about it?
32876,"Yeah, was it super cold?"
32877,I dont think I would have been brave enough to  do that
32878,That's a big accomplishment! I bet your're proud.
32879,That sounds like it will be so fun! I bet you all have a fabulous time.
32880,"Oh I'm sorry to hear that, why's that? :("
32881,Can you go to the store and get some more before she notices? 
32882,oh yea i do too i have 3
32883,fat and sassy too
32884,Sorry to hear about your loss.
32885,Yes I have been in that situation. Just stay positive.
32886,What happened to your car?
32887,Oh yikes that's awful
32888,Awesome.  You must be excited.
32889,How long since you've seen her?
32890,1What happened
32891,O no I hope you tried to stop him
32892,I bet they were in the last place you looked
32893,Yeah that is usually how it goes
32894,oh yeaaa do tell
32895,ah snap!
32896,Fast? Like sonic the hedgehog?
32897,Oh no! We do need to hurry then don't we?
32898,"I understand sometimes it uncomfortable to socialize, I get anxiety in social situations"
32899,Sometimes its just a phase or maybe the group of people are not making an effort to make you feel included? I am sorry I know how that feels.
32900,That is great! What is driving your happiness?
32901,It's always a blessing to have certain times in life where no problems are occurring!
32902,that is so sweet of you
32903,"i bet you had no problems, dogs are easy to take care of, they blindly accept anything"
32904,"Oh boy, you okay? How does that make you feel?"
32905,Absolutely! Trusting your partner is so important.
32906,How do you think they went? 
32907,I hope so too! Good luck. :D 
32908,It is annoying especially if in certain situations.
32909,Absolutely couldnt agree more.
32910,"Wow that is so terrible. But you must've been really ill, I'm sure everyone understood."
32911,"Oh my goodness, I can only imagine how horrible that was for you."
32912,Neat! What was the case?
32913,That is a victory! Those pesky parking tickets can be a pain sometimes!
32914,Im sorry to hear that. what did you decide to do?
32915,Yeah that seems like the best thing to do
32916,Being happy where your life is has got to be one of the best feelings. I'm happy for you!
32917,It's all about what you do with those bumps and just pushing through them I think.
32918,"that's a bummer, i hope it was nothing serious happen to your car"
32919,"that is good to hear,  there are always kind people out there to help"
32920,"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry! Where are you staying now?"
32921,I can't imagine what you're going through. That must be extremely hard.
32922,"Ugh, thats the worst, especially when you just strictly looking. Were you planning on buying?"
32923,Yeah. Pushy salespeople are so annoying though! They accomplish the opposite of their goal when they become too overpowering over their customers.
32924,"o no, i hope no one noticed"
32925,Yeah i would not think about it to much.
32926,That is good that you feel better! What happened to change your perspective?
32927,I see! Well self-exploration and reflection is usually really productive!
32928,"im sorry, did you say anything to him""?"
32929,Yeah i would have yelled at him
32930,That sounds fun.  I'm sure she knows you well enough to get you something that will suit you well.
32931,That sound like a very useful gift that you'll use a lot in the course of a day.
32932,i can imagine but it is good to get out
32933,"That is really cool, everyone should do something like that"
32934,thats so awesome congrats
32935,my daughter just had her 2nd such happy
32936,Was he any good or talented at it?
32937,Well that sounds like fun to me.
32938,That sounds fun how long has it been since you have seen her?
32939,Yeah i bet it was a long long drive
32940,I'm so sorry to hear that. You must be disappointed.
32941,That's a great attitude to have! Positivity is always a great quality to have.
32942,Hello! How are you.
32943,That's an incredible blessing that they love you. Some people have different opinions about that so your lucky you come rom a supportive family.
32944,"oh no, were you polite to him? It can be pretty frustrating."
32945,"oh no, is there any way you can file a complaint against him? And it's the same guy?! So weird!!!"
32946,Yeah i have a photo album and every time i look at it i smile
32947,Yeah i know but atleast you have memories of him
32948,That sounds exciting.  Was there a prize?
32949,That's hysterical!  It was definitely a unique prize then.
32950,That's awesome. What do you like about your family?
32951,"Aw, that's very sweet! I wish I was that close with my family."
32952,awesome
32953,thats sounds fun
32954,"Oh wow! That's impressive, those can be really hard to get."
32955,"Congratulations, that's great! Hopefully you like the work."
32956,Wow! What was scary about it?
32957,Interesting! I bet live actors really enhance the experience!
32958,oh man. That is not good. Do you feel okay?
32959,I'm sorry man. You can reach out to me anytime.
32960, i hear ya there
32961,Oh that is wonderful I know that means a lot to you. It has great sentimental value I am sure.
32962,I am sure it did and I know you will treasure that mug. Put it in a special safe place on display so you see it every day..
32963,Oh wow. Good for her! Does she have a great job to afford such a great lifestyle?
32964,I'm sure that much be hard to stand by and watch as someone who works hard for their things. 
32965,I love Sonic! I used to go as a kid a lot as well. They have the best shakes.
32966,I bet going to one again brought back a bunch of wonderful memories.
32967,no idear who that is but im sure you liked it
32968,That's an unfortunate situation. What's the diagnosis?
32969,I see. He should probably get that checked out by a doctor. It's best to check out these things I think.
32970,"That is terrible to hear, hopefully you didn't injure anything more than your pride."
32971,Well maybe your boss was one of them and you get some brownie points for trying to get to work quickly
32972,Wow im sorry to hear that
32973,That is awesome! Im glad it worked out
32974,"Are you tired, or do you have early plans tomorrow?"
32975,"Oh, that's exciting! There is nothing like relaxing on the porch in the evening. "
32976,"Oh, that's cool! How many do you have?"
32977,oh myy
32978,Sounds lovely! I bet it brought back a lot of memories.
32979,Do you have fond memories of it>
32980,That's so unfortunate. My condolences. Is there anything you can do to help?
32981,I wish your friends mom all the best. A miracle could happen!
32982,What did you do!
32983,Yeah it must have been!
32984,Oh no! Are you okay?
32985,Ouch! That sounds painful. You poor thing.
32986,Well it should be ok and don't feel guilty. Two cookies are not that big of a deal
32987,"You may feel a little guilty and I understand that, Maybe run to the store and pick up more?"
32988,Congratulations on getting that far! What position is it?
32989,Nice! That is a good role! Do you like a leadership position?
32990,"That's terrible, what's wrong?"
32991,"That's awful, I hope things get better for you."
32992,Is it a good one?
32993,Tell me.  I want to hear it.
32994,That's no fair.  Your friend will never know.
32995,"Why, what's wrong?"
32996,And did it not go over well?
32997,Were you able to find someone?
32998,"Well that's great,  Someone you trust too."
32999,"That sounds so sweet, it's always nice to look back on fond times."
33000,Sometimes all we have is our memories.
33001,You're such a naughty person.  What did she do?
33002,Oh no.  That didn't go well then.  Look for a ring next time.
33003,What makes you feel lucky?
33004,That's so sweet of you!
33005,Im guessing you must have had a family memeber die?   Im so sorry for your loss.   
33006,THat must be tough to deal with.  I cant imagine losing a parent!
33007,Does a guest house mean you rent it out or you let family and friends stay for free?
33008,Taht sounds lucrative! I have a place in Big sky MT. it worked out very wellas far as renting.
33009,Why's that? Are you worried about driving?
33010,Ah-ha! Do you know anyone in your family who's good at bargaining? Maybe the sales-person is a hard-bargainer.
33011,"Wow, I wonder if she knew that you two were together. Did she know that you saw her?"
33012,She totally knew! I guess it's flattering to know your partner is good looking enough to have a woman stare him down like that.
33013,"I have been there, done that.  I used to be a dog groomer and I love dogs.   Its so sad to go the pound and see all the homeless dogs."
33014,I usually deal with it by not going to the pound anymore to look.   I had a dog die in a house fire not long ago and I am just not ready for a dog.
33015,I'm such a scaredy cat when it comes to scary movies. What was the movie about?
33016,Oh gosh. That's terrifying! I don't know anyone who likes those kind of movies!! 
33017,"wow. That is amazing, I love to change. What color did you choose? "
33018,"Nice. I would like to do the same, but it is very expensive where I live. I hope I can afford it one day."
33019,Woo! Where are you headed?
33020,Omg! Europe is my absolute favorite place in the world. I recently came back from Italy and Greece 2 months ago and loved it!
33021,"Well, I went to Venice, which I absolutely loved, but it was very crowded. I hear Florence is beautiful too! In Greece, I recommend Santorini, or Mykonos if you wanna party! "
33022,"Yay! It's BEAUTIFUL. If you go, you will love it. "
33023,Oh wow where you in the area when it happened?
33024,Thank Jesus! lol I am glad you are OK.
33025,Same. It's hard to predict.
33026,How did you accomplish this?
33027,Where do you keep everything?
33028,Do you have some sort of method of organizing everything?
33029,How much stuff did you have to go through?
33030,Well its always a good thing to keep a promise. Can I ask what the promise was?
33031,"Well I applaud your dedication and faithfulness in making sure you kept the promise, good job!"
33032,See things work out well when you make doing the right thing a priority. I am glad you followed through on it
33033,"Ah its ok, we all amke mistakes. Are you in a new town?"
33034,Good! I bet you got it down much faster after making a mistake.
33035,Did you move in a better home? 
33036,WOW that's so convienient.
33037,"Well, at least you dont have to worry about him begin ok in life. He can take care of himself, now. You can give him tips on making better choices with his money"
33038,"I understand.My little brother did too.. I have the family and he has the career. We are 10 years apart, but he make a ton more money than, I do. Maybe you can get your brother to invest in homes, and you all start a business."
33039,"Right, you should! Remember they arent making any more land!"
33040,Wholesaling would be an great options. You could go on Youtube and find tons of videos about flipping homes with no money.. but if your brother has a little change.. Well.. Go Brother! lol
33041,"I will go out on a limb and say she didn't hold up her end, hope you get your garden back bright and beautiful"
33042,"I understand the frustration a good garden takes time and patience, I have no doubt you will grow it back better than before"
33043,"No problem I got faith in you, really enjoyed this chat"
33044,Awwww.. what a heart warming moment. That was so sweet of you to do! 
33045,"That's so cute! Turtles running around?! Haha!! I have a rabbit, he loves to hop around my house too!"
33046,Good luck.  That sounds really frustrating.  Hope everything was backed up.
33047,Sounds like a good plan.  I hope it's simple and you can get it working again.
33048,Do you have experience fixing computers?
33049,I hear you.  Technology is supposed to make things simpler.  Not always the case.
33050,Oh yeah? Nice to hear. What exactly did you do?
33051,"That's awesome, I'm from Kansas and first went to Colorado just a couple years ago. It was beautiful!"
33052,"I agree though, always a good time to get away and explore some nature life."
33053,Well I'm pleased to hear you had a fun time. Hope you get to do it again soon.
33054,Wow it must have been good feeling
33055,"Oh man, I'm so sorry. How did it happen?"
33056,That is so sad. Did you see it happen?
33057,"ooh, sorry to hear that, was it by itself?"
33058,sorry. Probably the driver did not see her
33059,"wow. Am happy for you, just commit to it and it will thrive"
33060,all the best
33061,did you tell them to stop speaking?
33062,i bet .Next time call the people in charge
33063,"Oh, dear. did they pull you over?"
33064,Were you speeding? I would have been nervous too.
33065,"I see. Well, I hope all you got was a ticket."
33066,"oooh, thats so scary and bad of them"
33067,"Thats worrying, she need help"
33068,"My friend and I were out at the bars one night, doing the usual young people thing. They had been acting off a little all night, and when I asked if they were okay, they told me everything was fine. I knew this wasn't true since I had known this person for years, but the night came to a close and we got a cab home. "
33069,I'm sorry you felt that way. Is it any better now?
33070,Your friend must trust and care for you a lot to confide in you like that. how did you react?
33071,That's good. you must have been surprised by the confession.
33072,Wow! I hope he doesn't do anything too crazy!
33073,I hope you have as much fun as he does!
33074,Oh that's great. Were you able to help him move?
33075,Well at least you were able to introduce him to your friend. I hope everything works out for him!
33076,"Sometimes going out with friends can relax the mind, who knows you might ace the test ."
33077,"That stinks , cheer up and try again "
33078,"hello, why whats happened ?"
33079,you founded the preacher helpful ?
33080,I never did go to a preacher.
33081,What was the secret about?
33082,"I won't tell anyone! Come on, just one juicy detail??"
33083,I am really sorry to hear that.  How are you healing from it?
33084,That's good.  I'm glad you had good doctors to help you get back on your feet (no pun intended).  Are you having o be out of work?
33085,I mean did they reward your 25 years of service at your job by giving you a present or throwing you a party. It's pretty common for workers when they reach such a milestone to be recognized in such a way.
33086,You should've made them buy another cake!
33087,"thats great, are you enjoying it?"
33088,"thats awesome, im glad they were helpful!"
33089,Oh I'm so socially awkward and anxious I'd never be able to give a speech. How did it turn out?
33090,I'm so happy to hear that! Practice does make perfect.
33091,Oh I am so sorry to hear that. :( I hope that she will be alright. Is it serious?
33092,Oh no! Well you better spend as much time with her as you can now. It could be any time she leaves. Oh what a heard situation you are going through! If you need a friend I am always here for you.
33093,"That's very lucky, how much was it for?"
33094,"Yeah I can understand, it's definitely a pleasant surprise."
33095,That's good to be able to depend on others.
33096,"That's so true, life is very fragile and I find it easy to forget that."
33097,It's nice to be loyal to people who are loyal to you.  Is your job going to offer you any benefits for your loyalty?
33098,Why did you choose to stay?
33099,Food is the hardest part when it comes to getting healthy sometimes. Dont give up! 
33100,Omg! Okay now I understand how difficult it really must be for you! 
33101,"Oh my that must have been frightening! Poor little cat, what happened afterwards?"
33102,"I can just imagine, maybe she wanted a bath. Glad to know she wasn't harmed."
33103,That sould make me feel sad. Did you talk to him about it?
33104,"That's not very nice. I think it is just better to be honest, even if it might hurt."
33105,I certainly know that feeling.
33106,You can always improve that anytime you want to.  I have faith in you.
33107,Do you plan on paying him back quickly? 
33108,"I mean its pretty crappy to take anything from anyone, but hes your brother so it is slightly less crappy as long as you pay him back! "
33109,Uh oh.  I'm sorry to hear that.  That is never a good thing to do as a supervisor.
33110,"Unfortunately he wins out when you do that because it will likely continue.  Again, I wish you had been treated so unkindly."
33111,Something juicy I hope. 
33112,Whoops! Did she take it with anything approaching a sense of humor?
33113,Oh no! I am afraid to ask what it was.... but what was it?
33114,Yuck! You better put a trap up there. You know they have these wireless web cams these days for really cheap so it may be a good idea to get one of those so you know for sure if you have an infestation.
33115,Oh dear. Is it what I am thinking? Did she wreck it?
33116,I am so sorry to hear about that. The good thing is she is okay
33117,I would be upset as well
33118,"Wow, that's really great that they pitched in to help. You must be happy about that!"
33119,"The more hands, the quicker the work!"
33120,Making moves to do better is all you can do.  How has it been going?
33121,That is great!  The longer you do it the easier it will get.  Keep up the good work!
33122,No problem!
33123,What were you invited to speak about?
33124,"It's hard to condense a pep talk into nice little one liners. But I think if you just go for it, breathe deeply a bunch, and pretend it's just you in that room, I think you'll do great!"
33125,"i hate to ask what happen, I imagine something went wrong"
33126,"that is the problem with cheating, you have to live with it especially if you have a conscious, all I can say is to use this promotion as a lesson to better prepare yourself next time"
33127,Had she been bothering you recently?
33128,I get that. I don't respond well when people are rude to me.
33129,What a pain!  I think when a big company makes so much money and they say they'
33130,"Oops, sorry, I didn't finish my thought.  I think they make enough money to handle it and that inconvenience is worth $80.  Plus now you'll definitely buy again with them so I think it works in their favor and yours!"
33131,That's awesome. It's wonderful to feel prepared!
33132,"Now you just have to keep up that same energy all year, that's the difficult part."
33133,Congradulations.   You must be excited and proud.   Are you enjoying the new car?
33134,Oh no!  Hopefully you have full coverage? 
33135,"Yeah but, its better than having no car!"
33136,"Does your insurance have the ""new care replacement""  option?"
33137,That is great!  When is the wedding?
33138,Are you having a bachelor party?
33139,The best kind of bachelor party.  That is exactly what I did for mine...20 years ago.
33140,You should make it an annual trip!  Then you can always be reminded of a good time in your life.
33141,How much did she give you over
33142,Most places will make her replace the 10 so you should really go back to there and explain what happened
33143,"That sounds like he startled you quite a bit, hope it wasn't a black cat."
33144,Awww well other than the heart attack giving sounds like a cute cat
33145,I am sorry to hear that. How did that make you feel?
33146,I feel your pain. I hope you had someone to lean on.
33147,I have not seen the message about the incident but I do hope that person will speak to you.
33148,That was the right thing to do. You respect your marriage.
33149,Awesome. I love my mate too. That coworker is very out of order! 
33150,I'm sorry you had to go through all that stress. But yay for you being able to leave that situation!
33151,That's great to hear. It sounds like it's a well needed change. Things will look up from here!
33152,Do you trust your friend?
33153,That's great.  Its good to have a friend you can trust that much.
33154,Would it be a promotion?
33155,I hope you make the right choice!
33156,That is a pretty weird thing to have happen
33157,Maybe you should contact the news about it
33158,Sounds like somebody needs an accountabili-buddy...
33159,Wow you should probably tell her so that lies and decent don't become commonplace in your marriage.
33160,That is not ok to do.
33161,Yeah people like that are jerks
33162,He must have been very excited! That is awesome.
33163,Ah. You must do it more often. Children are so precious.
33164,Oh no! Did they take you to jail?
33165,"Yeah, I wouldn't feel to good about myself either but at least no one got hurt including yourself."
33166,"Oh my, it must have been an exciting time for you seeing your brother after such a long time"
33167,I can understand why it would be a little nerve wracking but I am glad you caught up with him
33168,Sounds scary. Did you find out what it was?
33169,Were there any recent events in your neighborhood that would make you worry?
33170,you should go to their place
33171,that is sad that they cant atleast talk to you
33172,Oh no!  They are mean to not have told you.  I would've told you.  How did it even get there?
33173,"Oops!  Well, just hold your head high because things happen to all of us and it doesn't speak to who you are as a person so just let it roll off your chest.  Shame that people are decent enough to help."
33174,"Hey, I bet you'll do great! Nothing to stress about. "
33175,Just try to stay positive and get a good night's rest the night before and I'm sure you'll do amazing! Just have to go in with confidence.
33176,"Wow, you must really be excited. Do you have room for it in your kitchen?"
33177,That sounds delicious! Can I come over?
33178,Congratulations on the good raising of the kid! I bet you were just flooded with all kinds of memories.
33179,Wow that is so sweet. Have you shown her it yet?
33180,"That just warms my heart, thank you for telling me that."
33181,Hail can be freaky! Was there any damage?
33182,"We don't get them too often, here. Though there's usually a few tornadoes that touch down somewhere in the area, each year. "
33183,I bet that was nice though.
33184,Does your high school do reunions where you could see them again?
33185,"Wow, what happened next, is he alright?"
33186,Wow what type of dog is he? Is he a big one that acts tough or a little one that needs lots of love?
33187,"Wow, I actually love them! Did you take him to see a vet? You seem so concerned about him to even take time off work."
33188,I am so glad to hear that. A healthy puppy makes everyone happy.
33189,Nice!  What did you end up with?
33190,I say if you can afford it enjoy it.  What is your favorite feature?
33191,"I haven't, but I would love to get one.  I love full feature phones!"
33192,Everything about getting something new like that is fun!
33193,You must be very fond of such memories. Do they make you feel nostalgic?
33194,"Its always good to think about such moments, I wish I could go back to these times."
33195,"Wow, he did he do?"
33196,You must be so proud of him!
33197,What am amazing feeling that must be!  Did it take you a long time?  Must have felt so satisfying.
33198,Its paying off!  That's awesome. How much can you bench?
33199,I agree! Is she excited?
33200,"Haha, Good for her! She is becomeing more independent! Do you know what kind of car?"
33201,Feeling sentimental much?
33202,I know how you feel.  I've got old rifles from both of my grand fathers... along with some WW II bring backs.  I don't think I could sell them.
33203,Sorry to hear that. I hope you're not feeling too sad. 
33204,I had no idea snakes even lived that long. I am sure he was a faithful buddy to you.
33205,Maybe its time to find a new job?
33206,Awesome.  Are you feeling a little jealous?
33207,"Don't worry, I'm sure she'll put a dent in it before the month is up."
33208,You should take a ride with her and try to get her to paralell park in a tight space or something
33209,oh my goodness. Thats so cool. who did you show it to.
33210,"Wow, love looking through memorable s. brings back good memories."
33211,"Yeah, tell me about it. I have nothing from that far back from my family."
33212,I will. I bet my aunt has some things to give me.
33213,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Coffee always cures my headache. But then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too."
33214,I wish I could say the same. I am addicted. :(
33215,Why not? Is everything okay?
33216,That must be somewhat frustrating at times.
33217,Oh that is awful. The loss of a pet is just the worst
33218,I hope it starts to not hurt so much. I always take forever to stop hurting from those things.
33219,"It is good to have people you can count on. If you can't trust your family, who can you trust? :)"
33220,Totally! I also have a very trusting family.
33221,That's unfortunate. I hope you didn't get chewed out too badly.
33222,I guess they don't see it as just copy paper. To them stealing is stealing no matter how petty. At least you have the chance to change your ways and keep your job.
33223,"Sorry to hear that, it must be absolutely devastating. But you must stay strong."
33224,I am glad you have all the support you need. The important thing is your family is safe. 
33225,What? Oh no! Can they do that?  I would fight it and see what happened.  You must feel sick.
33226,I am so sorry.  That is awful. Definitely look into your rights as an accepted student who was counting on that and made all your plans around it.
33227,Oh no! I take they still got their claws. mine is the same way but there is one piece of furniture he just insists on ruining.
33228,oh my goodness. they got a taste of it and went to town. i'm so sorry.
33229,"Yep, thats what I did with the chair mine messed up pretty bad."
33230,Yeah I've gone a few times actually. Do you like them?
33231,"That's awesome! I wish you all the luck, but I bet you won't even need it."
33232,It's going to knock everyone dead! I'll be rooting for you
33233,Oops! Do you think that you can replace it?
33234,Oh know. I am sure your mother will forgive you. I was an accident and we all have accidents sometimes.
33235,That was nice of you to do. What kind of dog does she have?
33236,I love dogs! I am thinking of getting another one.
33237,"Oh my, do you have a draft saved. Or was that the only copy?"
33238,It must have been so aggravating. I hope the due date wasn't the next day! 
33239,That's amazing!  Did you get i?
33240,"Waiting is the worst!  Well, whatever happens is meant to be.  I wish you luck and success with your house!"
33241,"That's really great. You're setting a good example for your kids, too."
33242,That's really great! Your kids will thank you for giving them that important lesson.
33243,That is a good place to be.  Are you happy with your job?
33244,I'm sure it will!
33245,Yep more than that and you will need a big house and lots of toys! 
33246,Aw I am sure you will be good parent to all of them. Kids are the greatest joy in life.
33247,Really? That must be fun
33248,That is so nice I wish I had a car like that.
33249,Ugh do you have any security camera that might have captured what happened?
33250,I hope so too. Its really annoying when that happens and just ruins your day. 
33251,I hope you do very well! What subject?
33252,I think you will do great!
33253,Haha! That definitely must have scared many people that did not know what it was. That must be hilarious to watch!
33254,hahaha I can imagine! I guess I would have done the same. I hope you got him back. Heehee
33255,"And you know when men get sick, they're on their death bed."
33256,"And you know when men get sick, they act like they are dying."
33257,I'm sorry about that. What happened?
33258,"Wow, that stinks. Hopefully she will be there for you next time if you ever need help again. "
33259,It must be very difficult for you. Do you have someone you can talk to about it? I find that remembering the good times helps you keep their memory alive.
33260,That's great. It's nice to have family around that can help pick you up when you feel down.
33261,Awesome! What are your plans for this weekend.
33262,That is wonderful. I will be spending time at home.
33263,That is so sweet. Family is very important
33264,That's awesome! What show?
33265,That's an interesting experience!
33266,Has she had a history of illness?
33267,I'm sorry to hear that. 10 is still very young though so I hope you have plenty of more time to spend with her.
33268,I have some of that too. It would make me a little nervous.
33269,"Ugh, well I hope the best for you, that it is all nice and intact when you get back."
33270,Really? Why you should have been patient.
33271,Oh dear. Maybe you were just a bit impatient but I am sure he will forgive you 
33272,WOW! That is really cool! What will you buy?
33273,Have fun spending it!
33274,"That must have been embarrassing, wasnt it?"
33275,Did you retaliate against your boss?
33276,Was it a prestigious or expensive vase?
33277,Looks like it was just an accident. It happens and you shouldn't blame yourself for it.
33278,"Great, since you are prepared I'm sure you will do great!"
33279,"If you could speak with someone that work there you could learn more about what to expect and what things they value the most, but you certainly seem very prepared."
33280,It's very scary! I live near the coast too! I don't know if my home will still be here in 50 years.
33281,"No, I'm not. I'm hopeful that the deniers will start to come to their senses and maybe we can slow the warming of the earth."
33282,I am so glad to hear everything is going well for you!. It is good to hear your health is improving.
33283,That is a long time to suffer. It seems like it is a new day for you.
33284,Oh no! I'm so sorry!  Is she okay? That is so great that she has you.
33285,I agree.  Be there no matter what.  I hope she heals quickly.  
33286,That's good that you trusted him. Sometimes I miss out on good opportunities because it is hard to trust.
33287,That's awesome. That's a good amount for a little effort which is always nice. 
33288,your intuition seems to be trustful and the right way to go
33289,must be great to have that feeling of accomplishment and independent.
33290,haha... you little thief! (joking) That must have been some good pizza!
33291,"Ahhh, oh well. Don't beat yourself up. I am pretty sure that I have done something like that before too. I think it was with birthday cake. I love birthday cake!!!!!"
33292,Haha! No! It's not wrong! My son played travel baseball for 6 years and we spent 6 days a week at the ballfields!
33293,"It's a huge commitment for him and you! If you don't think you can do it, I wouldn't sign him up. There's no shame in that!"
33294,Wow! How did it go?
33295,That must have made you feel pretty nostalgic!
33296,That would really stress me out
33297,That is just the worst feeling. Part of the reason I work from home
33298,Oh they need to take care of that asap!
33299,Well for your sake I hope it gets taken care of soon.
33300,That awful!  Were you able to continue without it?  That must have really messed up your rhythm.
33301,Did it start back up? Glad you were able to start over.
33302,You are a good friend.
33303,yes they deserve respect unless they do soemthing cruel.
33304,Why did he move so far away?
33305,That's very sad.  I'm sure he'll be back to visit.
33306,"i hope your mom can understand , it was an accident and everyone makes mistakes "
33307,"lol, well hope she doesnt notice"
33308,Was it a good feeling or a bad feeling?
33309,I do too. Being a kid was so easy.
33310,Also not having a ton of responsibilites!
33311,Yeah I completely understand that.
33312,"Oh man, that's a long break. How did it go?"
33313,That's great! Did your co workers help?
33314,"Hahaha that's funny. my bad, I feel like i need to hit the gym again as well."
33315,Yea it sucks to go but feels great once you leave.
33316,What did you get up to in August usually?
33317,I used to love bonfires back in my day those were the days.
33318,"Agreed, what was your favorite memory?"
33319,"Whoa that's out of left field, how'd that happen."
33320,Good for you! Are you going to tell your girlfriend about it?
33321,You are an honest man as well. I salute you! A rare breed indeed.
33322,"Aww, so cute! I bet your having such a fun time with him/her!"
33323,Wow I didn't know you could litter train rabbits. It's always challenging house training a new pet. I hope he learns quick!
33324,Oh cool. I love looking through my old photos. makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
33325,Me too. I love to ponder about the good ole days. Did you share the photos with your friends or parents?
33326,"Oh no, did it burn?"
33327,"I hate when I do that, but it is better for it to be cooked to long, than not long enough...."
33328,"That must of been fun, where did you meet?"
33329,That is amazing. I hope I can get the family together soon.
33330,"Oh no, that's terrible. Is there anyway to redo it?"
33331,You better prepare well for that final.
33332,"that sounds amazing, I hope they enjoy it a lot!"
33333,"It sounds like it will, i hope you have  a great dinner!"
33334,That's wonderful!  Are you thinking of proposing?
33335,"That's a good thing to be financially prepared, trust me.  My husband and I spent most of the money we had on a honeymoon and then struggled for years doing things the wrong way. You're smart!"
33336,Wowza! That is a good spouse. Were you suprised?
33337,Good i bet you deserved it. :)
33338,That is not good. Did they give you back your money? 
33339,"I would be upset too, they need to do their work properly."
33340,I am glad that you got it cleared up.
33341,"I hope so too, you should have reported it to a supervisor or manager."
33342,Why? Are you not happy with the job or you want to make more money?
33343,Well I guess you should probably find a new job before quitting your present job.
33344,I have had that happen before and it is super annoying!
33345,I do not blame you one bit!
33346,"i used to get chased by dogs too , back then when i was younger fences were not to common"
33347,"lucky you , i was bit a few times but it was my fault i provoked the dogs "
33348,That sounds fun!  The arcades were always kind of noisy for me though.
33349,You should go in a play some!
33350,"Oh, that's so hard! How are you feeling about it? Itching to go back, or dreading it?"
33351,That's good! At least it's someone you can trust instead of a stranger at a daycare center. 
33352,Ouch! What did they do for it?
33353,That sounds so painful! I hope it gets better fast.
33354,That can be nerve wracking.  Are you worried?
33355,Ah.  I find a mock interview with a friend can help.
33356,That is smart of you. How did it go?
33357,I am sure you will be OK. The doctors can be very scary sometimes but most people get scared about things that aren't worth it.
33358,"that is so sad to hear, it must be tough for you"
33359,"wow that is a long time, but remember you had great experience with her and will have fond memories for the rest of you life"
33360,Good job! Hopefully she deserves the faithful person you are!
33361,I can't help but be a little jealous. haha
33362,Its possible she is just trying to be helpful.
33363,I can see how that would be really annoying. Just nod and say yeah. Thats what works for me.
33364,Did he live up to the belief?
33365,That's great!  I'm sure he appreciated that you trusted him.
33366,How exciting for you. Kids truly are amazing. Now the fun really starts.
33367,Now you will have to really be careful what you say around him. They tend to repeat everything they hear when you least suspect it.
33368,That is great! Congrats!
33369,I bet you are so happy you stuck with it.. definitely something to be proud of.
33370,"Aw, will you be able to keep her company?"
33371,That is very thoughtful of you. You are a good sister!
33372,"Aw, nice! That's kind of cool, actually. I hope you really encourage her to stick to it and do well. Sometimes there can be a lot of expectations that come with that stuff, so whatever you can do to not add pressure to it would be great."
33373,"Yeah, I think her parents or her peers, or even herself probably, may put  a lot of expectations on her. While you want to reassure and encourage her, it's good to not make her plan too far ahead in the future and put all that weight on her. It's what my parents did with me, and I resented them for it."
33374,"I not sure what do you mean, but can use my imagination,  it sounds like something really embarrassing."
33375,"Yes what I thought,  I guess your roommate must have been more embarrassed."
33376,"Dang, i can relate i moved away from my mom a long time ago and still get a little homesick."
33377,At least now a ways you can face time or call her to at least stay in contact.
33378,"I feel like this is me. I'm clean, but I'm stuck with a dirty roommate who doesn't do dishes. And I also live in a place that is old and looks terrible to begin with. Sorry you have to deal with that, because I know I hate living in it!"
33379,"Me either. I've always been a fairly clean person. Had to move out of my parents home for college, and both roommates I've had have been kind of messy. I don't know how people don't feel weird and uncomfortable making other people live in/clean up their mess."
33380,Oh no! That can be very scary! Did you make it out ok?
33381,Was it a stranger or someone you knew?
33382,"Haha wow, thats cool. "
33383,"Oh really, what was the play?"
33384,"That is awesome, I remember Odell Beckham doing that a few years ago."
33385,That's horrible. I'd talk to your best friend and tell him how you feel firstly.
33386,"If your best friend is truly a best friend of yours, they won't leave you over this. It isn't right to tell his girlfriend in my opinion, but it is good if you speak to him about the situation."
33387,Whoop Whoop! Thanks for reminding me. I have to purchase youtube live for it.
33388,Same here! Who is your team?
33389,Nice! I asdly am a corn husker. it's been a rough couple of years.
33390,That must have been so fun!
33391,It sounds like you have a great family!
33392,I guarantee that you will be fine! I graduated with a master's last year
33393,Environmental Engineering - my second engineering degree
33394,That's wonderful news. I have also battled depression and am feeling better now. That  is a real big deal.
33395,Wow! congrats and keep it up. I know it helps me to stay really busy.
33396,Thats nice to  hear. Its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit. 
33397,Aw it must have felt so nostalgic going through old memories. Its nice to cherish them. 
33398,Do you miss him?
33399,Be sure to facetime or skype with him. That will help with the loneliness. 
33400,"Oh no, that's terrible.  Is he in legal trouble?"
33401,This is such a difficult thing for you to go through.  I hope he learns from this and changes his path.
33402,I understand. But you must cherish every moment because soon our babies grow up and become great adults.
33403,"Oh, that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you!"
33404,"I don't blame you, I wouldn't want to mess with that either. "
33405,"Why is that, might I ask? Maybe I can help you reframe it better to look at it more positively."
33406,"Oh, I see. Yeah, it kind of stinks being around people who can afford things you would like. But maybe you can view it as you being more mindful and responsible with your money."
33407,"That's very lucky of you, what do you plan on doing now?"
33408,"If you did have to move, might I suggest Boston as an alternative?"
33409,Don't be nervous. I am sure you did alright. It is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head.
33410,"Oh good, then there is nothing you should be worried about then. :) Go relax and distract your mind on something else. All will work out my friend."
33411,I hope you feel better soon. Maybe you can take a trip out to visit her?
33412,I bet she really misses you. How far away did you move?
33413,"Oh wow, that's really far! Well I hope you get to go soon and have a safe trip!"
33414,Yea that can be tough. What kind of dogs? Are they easy to train?
33415,Yup. I did that with my new cat and it ended up working out OK.
33416,Yup! I am sure you guys will get through it!
33417,"I can understand the anxiety, I'm sure you'll do fine though!"
33418,"Sleep is so important before an exam, that's where all your facts and memories get better organized"
33419,"im sorry, theres nothing worse than that. i hope you're doing okay"
33420,im sorry. it eventually gets better though
33421,"thats nice to hear, too many relationships ending nowadays"
33422,wow thats awesome good for you
33423,oh no!  I'm so sad to hear that :(
33424,Yeah that's all you can do I guess.  Do you do anything cool in his memory?
33425,Oh no did he/she get better? Did you have to take them to the vet?
33426,"Oh dang, there were multiple cats that were sick?"
33427,"same, cats are so awesome"
33428,"haha mine loves to just lay on me and get pets, hes so soft and cute"
33429,"hes a rag doll with blue eyes and a white coat that ends in gray on his face tail and paws, what about yours?"
33430,thats nice thank you for telling me about your cat
33431,You must be so excited! What game did you get?
33432,That actually got great reviews. I am sure you are going to love it!
33433,That's unfortunate. Did you have the flu?
33434,Your next adventure will go much smoother. I once got a really bad rash in Hawaii when I visited.
33435,"That's awesome, where did you go?"
33436,"I love california, I have some family in Sacramento! And I bet it feels great to be home after a long drive."
33437,Oh my Gosh. I am sorry. that can be really tough.
33438,Thats the most important thing. I bet he wants you to move on and be happy.
33439,Haha that's really cool! What kind of watch is it?
33440,Oh nice. Yea he would be happy to know you are wearing it now.\
33441,Oh no. Did the workers have to come clean it up?
33442,I bet you were a little embarrassed. I wouldnt worry too much about it. Im sure it happens everyday. 
33443,That is so nice!  Did you get lots of presents?
33444,So fun.  Did you have your baby? Congratulations on your pregnancy!
33445,Ahh sounds like some great memories. Do you often feel nostalgic about these times?
33446,Thats a great idea. That way your kids will get to experience such lovely moments as well.
33447,"Wow, lucky you.  I hope you are enjoying your time there.  They will be appreciative of the gifts."
33448,How much longer are you staying for?
33449,"To have some rest after working so hard, it is very important."
33450,It is a perfect leisure activity.
33451,That sucks! It happens to the best of us. At least the computer didn't break.
33452,"Yeah, that would have been an expensive accident! Your lucky. :)"
33453,Holy cow that's awesome!  Who is it?
33454,Hmm.  Never heard of them.  I'll look them up and give them a listen!  Hope you have fun!!!
33455,Ha.  I actually live in KY. 
33456,Yup.  We have a bluegrass event on the square once a year in the town that I live in
33457,That is Good! How long have you been together?
33458,Thats good! Sadly thats tough to find these days.
33459,That is great.  Its good to not take family and friends for granted. 
33460,Keep that attitude and you will go far!  
33461,"Those are the best times,I can't wait until my son plays."
33462,He is 2!
33463,Aww thats a great time in life.
33464,Is he your first?
33465,That is cool! What kind of car?
33466,Those are nice cars! I hope you are able to get one!
33467,"Oh no, what's wrong with your current car?"
33468,That sounds terrible. I'm sorry I can't diagnose a car over the internet though. My first guess for that is usually the battery. Then things like the cables or the starter or fuses.
33469,That is awesome. What type of dog do you have?
33470,"My mother-in-law has one, too."
33471,what are you going to do for his birthday
33472,i love birthday gathers
33473,What career do you work in?
33474,"You deserve a large raise, health care is hard work!"
33475,"Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Was it due to a test?"
33476,Math is not my favorite.  Can you ask the teacher/professor?
33477,"That is terrible, i am sorry! hopefully youll be able to get it taken care of this time."
33478,What type of degree are you getting?
33479,Yea those shows are hard to watch. 
33480,Yea I agree. People can commit some really horrific crimes. It is scary.
33481,Was the date not going well?
33482,I hate when that happens. Was she understanding?
33483,"That's great, I wish I had been that productive today. Maybe I still have time for a load of laundry. Good job, you. "
33484,I just haven't been feeling too great today. Maybe your right though an easy task might make me feel better and get a head start for tomorrow. 
33485,Is he okay?
33486,ewwwww that's gross lol
33487,Where?  Why are you feeling uncertain?
33488,"I can understand the nerves, but it will be fun!"
33489,What happened/
33490,"Well, I hope you did the right thing and correct their mistake."
33491,"Oh, that's the biggest pain.  I feel like when you pay good money for care for your pet...they should at least be on time."
33492,We move our lives and schedules around to take care of our pets...the least the can do is do their work well.
33493,I sure hope that you get it!
33494,I believe you will get it!
33495,"that's right, it is supposed to come out  soon, I bet you will enjoy it very much"
33496,"sound like it must be killing you on waiting for the release, before you know it. you'll be playing it a ton"
33497,That is awesome. I bet you feel great!
33498,And its only going to get better. The longer you go the more progress you will see. Good for you.
33499,Good job. Is she better now?
33500,That stinks. I hope she feels better soon!
33501,"Wow, what did you see?"
33502,"Ugh, I hope he's alright and it was nothing too bab."
33503,Did he do a good job?
33504,"Thank god, bet you're pleased about that aren't you?"
33505,"Oh my, are you physically okay? It must have been very traumatic for you."
33506,Money can always come back but your health is the most important thing.
33507,"Oh no, that's no good. Did she find out?"
33508,Just have a talk with her and apologize. I'm sure she'll understand. Addiction is a life long battle. It's never too late to jump back on the wagon.
33509,Uh oh!   You should go see a doctor to get that checked out!
33510,"Yeah that's what I would do!  Good luck, friend!"
33511,What did you do?!
33512,Lousy man! What can you do though...if you're a regular she'll understand when you bring her extra another time.
33513,"sounds sweet, you must be raring to go"
33514,"lol, the kid in you is always ready for Disneyland"
33515,I agree.  Has something bad happened to you recently?
33516,Yeah it really can bring you down
33517,Oh man thats scary! What set it off?
33518,"I can imagine, i wouldnt have been at ease either."
33519,"Good luck! I bet you'll get it, I have a feeling."
33520,No problem! Is it a career oriented job?
33521,"That is exciting, what is the test for?"
33522,"Oh ok cool, are you already a police officer?"
33523,"Wow, thats horrible! Make sure to get a police report and send it to your insurance. "
33524,"I'm sorry, try to relax and have a good weekend. Know how fustrating that can be, hope there wasn't much damage."
33525,Awesome I am happy to hear that!
33526,"Nice, make sure to soak it up."
33527,I never know what to do in that situation.
33528,I bet. you never know if they are the crazy type or just down on their luck.
33529,oh just wait.. that's nothing. How long were you gone for?
33530,It rotted in 8 days? I'm pretty embarrassed. 
33531,Oh no!  I've had that happen before. Not at Walmart but at a dentist office. Did you make a dash out of there?
33532,"Yeah, I had to tell them some might be on the chair.  It was crazy awful! Oh no, ha ha. sorry that happened."
33533,Are you going to miss him?
33534,"I like to watch movies or read a good book when I feel lonely, to keep my mind busy "
33535,Uh oh. What went wrong?
33536,That's too bad. Did they taste okay though?
33537,"Aw, that stinks. What was wrong? Were you sick?"
33538,Wow! That's insane! I'm sorry that you had that experience! Hopefully you didn't miss too many days of work. 
33539,Heck yeah!  I love old tv shows!  What was it?
33540,Yeah.  It's kind of old now.  Was a really good show for its time until the RANDY DAYS
33541,Me too. Moms are the bees knees.
33542,My mom did too. Your mom sounds incredible.
33543,"Congrats! I'm sure you will, I love going to the gym. I mainly do cardio."
33544,Defenitly! I use to run track in high school and was active duty Army so running has always been a big part of my life.
33545,Awesome! I need to have a garage sale.
33546,I can understand that! I don't like clutter.
33547,Wow! That's amazing. I remember when mine started. It's off to the races soon! 
33548,Two words of advice... baby gates :)
33549,Aw man. I'm sorry. How old did he turn?
33550,It'll be ok. As long as both of you guys are healthy.
33551,"I sure hope so, do you think he is a determined and intelligent person?"
33552,"Nice, you must be proud of him being your brother."
33553,That was very nice of you. I am sure that your sister appreciated that.
33554,"Nice, do you get to go the zoo any number of times you want for free?"
33555,Sounds like a dream for any animal lover! I am guessing you must be one as well!
33556,"Ewww, I hope you complained so they can fix the problem! That is defenitly a health violation."
33557,"Oh okay! Hopefully it isn't a constant problem, that would suck to loose your favourite resturant."
33558,"i know how you feel, being young and at the beach was a fun time"
33559,you can make new memories and your kids can fondly look back at them as you do to yours
33560,Aww that's really sweet. I understand being sentimental about that sort of stuff. Do you feel like you have to?
33561,"You should just keep it for now. He may think that stuff is corny now, but later in life he will be glad you kept it."
33562,Haha how dare you. lol just kidding. What kind?
33563,Ooooo i understand why you did.
33564,Oh that's awful! Will insurance cover it?
33565,That's terrible. I hope you can get some compensation and feel better.
33566,"Yeah, not in awhile, but I definitely know that feeling.  Are you having a great week?"
33567,"That's awesome, I hope it stays that way!"
33568,Hey that's awesome!  Where ya going?
33569,Yeah I haven't either.  I bet it's gonna be awesome.  Bring plenty of beer :D
33570,Filled up? You better clean it before it overflows!
33571,"Ew, yeah, definitely sounds like it needs a good cleansing!"
33572,"Wowza, did you call to complain?"
33573,Phone companies are notorious for this. I hope you are able to resolve.
33574,I have had that happen to me many times.
33575,"It is definitely  a lot of work, but it is the best type of work I have ever done."
33576,That was nice of him. What idea did you have? As in how to return the favor or something?
33577,"Ohh... hah, that makes more sense. Then he did his job well. Good on him. But more importantly, congratulations to you for graduating! I know the feeling.. I'm close to graduating myself, and I can already feel the excitement. I hope no one surprises me with a party though.. too shy of a nerd for that."
33578,That's kind of disgusting. I'm glad she's your ex. That says much more about you than her. How did you respond to it?
33579,"Oh, that happened WHILE you were still dating? Man.. good call. The nerve of some people, and how immature they can be. I don't get how that wouldn't make someone cringe."
33580,They probably have to interview everyone else but it sounds promising!
33581,I bet it is! and I am sure you ARE good enough. Plus the way I see it if one door shuts another opens you know? Keep your head up 
33582,Aw it must so hard to let them move on to their own. 
33583,"I completely understand. My little baby just went off to college and although I miss him terribly, I am also proud of him."
33584,That sounds amazing!  Mom's food is ALWAYS the best.
33585,Wow!  That sounds like an amazing visit.  
33586,how did they find out?
33587,haha. has she found out yet? i bet she was mad
33588,i would be too!
33589,That sounds like a nightmare! Hopefully no one was hurt.
33590,Did they take a lot of things?
33591,That will be fun. I went for my 18th birthday and it was exciting.
33592,"Get the video, It is worth it!"
33593,I completely agree. It used to be about the story line and the character development. 
33594,"I hope so, too. Meanwhile, you can just watch old movies."
33595,"Ah, couldn't resist? Just make up and eat well tomorrow!"
33596,"Yeah, you should hide them at least!"
33597,That's cool. What are you gonna eat there?
33598,Oh sweet is it one of those where they cook it in front of you?
33599,"That is nice, what happened?"
33600,"That is awesome, hopefully yall can continue your relationship"
33601,It must have been nerve wracking! Did you do well?
33602,"Ha! When in doubt, just blame it on the microphone!"
33603,Oh gosh! That must have been embarrassing. What happened?
33604,Thank goodness for them! Did you not study your lines enough? Or you were just too nervous?
33605,Haha too funny! Wow 14?! Suprised you didn't learn it earlier haha 
33606,"I bet, thats a great memory! lol"
33607,"i agree with you there, I do not trust those eastern bloc countries."
33608,"you made a wise choice, not only will you not get your t-shirt most likely they will steal your credit card information and use it"
33609,My husband does that all the time to! Must be a guy thing haha
33610,"Wow, I hope he cleaned it up for you. I would be pissed hah I take coffee very serious."
33611,That's a loaded statement.. Can you unpack that for me? What are you so excited about that's coming up?
33612,"Oh, right on. Do you guys not have school starting already though? Maybe you guys have kids that aren't school-aged. Anyway, I've only been a couple of times, to go to Disney World. Is that where you guys are going? If so, I hope you have a good time!"
33613,hahahaha that's so funny.  Did you get it out of the house?
33614,Dang that's creative!!
33615,Rainy days are perfect for being lazy.
33616,That sounds relaxing.
33617,"Oh my, it must have been scary for you being in an unknown area,"
33618,What a good Samaritan! Be careful next time and carry a phone with you just in case. 
33619,What car is it?
33620,"Those are nice cars, but keep working, it will come in due time"
33621,"I agree, looks like a great game to play with friends! When is it coming out?"
33622,That is actually not far! I can see what I am going to be doing over the holidays! 
33623,"That's awesome, thats a kind of woman every man needs in their life."
33624,"I'm happy for you, I'm sure she feels the same about you!"
33625,What new job did you get?
33626,"That is great news, hopefully it goes well."
33627,"Oh yeah, what makes you say that?"
33628,"What an incredible stroke of luck! I hope he lets you check it out, really get your hands on it!"
33629,What'd they say exactly?
33630,What kind of hairstyle was it?
33631,That must make you feel good. Any favorites? 
33632,Ah yes that is a good one. Where you close with them?
33633,i have never gone. was it really that much fun going with an ex though?
33634,maybe i will check it out. i have heard good things about Branson
33635,"That is good then, I hope they can fix it for you!!"
33636,That is really sweet. It sounds like you really love her.
33637,It seems like you know what to do to make it work.
33638,"Oh no, I'm sorry that sounds awful disappointing. If it's any consolation I think it's easier to diet than to work out. THe old phrase ""can't outrun the fork."""
33639,I'm sorry. What has really helped my friend has been not keeping any snacks in the house and cutting out most bread. HE really struggles with bread and sugar though.
33640,"that sounds cool, they are a great vehicle"
33641,"you shouldn't be, it just a material object that has no lasting meaning"
33642,"oh im so sorry! it hurts when our parents leave us.  my uncle, who was basically my father, died in april."
33643,"it's ok to feel however you are feeling. it's normal. you never get over it, but you do learn to live with it."
33644,That's awful. Are you going to complain to the restaurant?
33645,What kind of toppings did you order?
33646,Why does baseball remind you of him?
33647,Those must be great memories.
33648,"Prepare to spend hours on it, the directions are always bad."
33649,"Yum! I had pizza as well tonight, although I didn't make it."
33650,"Yes I did, I need to learn how to cook one by myself!"
33651,"Ugh, do you know how it got there?"
33652,Oh my goodness! Do you think an intruder got in and used your house as a washroom for his dog?
33653,"I'm sure you will do fine! Just be confident, what is the job/"
33654,"Oh wow that sounds exciting! I'm sure you'll do great, just express that passion!"
33655,Haha i am sorry to laugh. Is it an expensive window to fix.
33656,"Damn, I am sorry that happenened.. did you talk to the paper boy?"
33657,Sorry to hear that. Have you tried encouraging them to play together?
33658,"Oh no, is he territorial? He will warm up eventually when he realizes the cat is a family member."
33659,"Oh I am so sorry. It's OK, it probably wasn't the cheetos that got him - rodents just don't have a long lifespan. I hope you feel better."
33660,"Rest in Power bubbles. You were, I'm sure, a hamster among hamsters."
33661,Do you think you can impress them?
33662,"I believe in you, just project yourself confidently!"
33663,"It definitely can be, just learn to drive defensively!"
33664,You will learn with experience and I'm sure you will be a great driver!
33665,Are you prepared? Do you have all the ingredients?
33666,Nice. I am sure it will taste great then.
33667,Did it bring back good memories?
33668,Sometimes it's fun to look back.
33669,I can understand your frustration.
33670,I am sure you can find a friend to help out.
33671,did you call your card company?
33672,i dont blame you. that is a very annoying thing to have to deal with
33673,Do little kids dressed as witches and ghosts frighten you?
33674,That's understandable. I've always been too scared to go to a haunted house. I get spooked easily.
33675,That is a very nice thing for him to do. Where did he pick you up?
33676,Wow were you ok? Lucky you didn't have to go to the hospital!
33677,Why did you give him access to your home though?
33678,"That makes sense, you guys going to hangout soon?"
33679,im terrified of rollercoasters
33680,"i agree, i just get on and close my eyes"
33681,"Oh my, I hope you weren't embarrassed about it, if it was a good trip?"
33682,Nice! I would love to go on trips except that my boss wouldn't like it if I did! 
33683,Did it help you rewind the old times? 
33684,"I agree, thats why I always keep my old year books around when I feel like I need a break from the present."
33685,Oh no! That's exciting and terrifying. Do you think it will work out?
33686,In that case I'd say you very well deserve it! I hope you get it.
33687,Ah yea now everyone is stuck staring at there phones.
33688,"Yeah, flying is the worst."
33689,You can also have some drinks too!
33690,Oh you left some out then? Were they worse ones?
33691,Ah I am also guilty of that one. I believe we all are in some ways.
33692,"How come, what are you doing wrong at work?"
33693,"I'm sorry to hear that, you must be so let down."
33694,That ig good to hear! How long have you been together?
33695,Aww that's a significant amount of time.
33696,I hope your dog makes a full recovery!
33697,How exciting! Do you feel like you are ready?
33698,It is great to be confident. I am sure you will knock the interview out of the park!
33699,Hey that's awesome!  Any plans this weekend?
33700,Yeah that's good that you're keeping a level head about it.  And realize that anything can happen at a moments notice.  I tend to appreciate what I have in my life as well.
33701,Oh no that sounds terrible. Hopefully it's not as bad as some of those stories I have read about where they go so far that they fake having the degree.
33702,"Oh my gosh that sounds so awful. I'm sorry. Maybe you can try getting him into rehab, I hear it's hard for someone to stop once they start."
33703,Your mom must be a strong woman.
33704,That sounds so troubling.  You should get on your brother's case.
33705,What a bummer. Did you have any sort of coverage for it? And how did you do it accidentally?
33706,Hopefully you can get through the rough patch in the interim. 
33707,Yeah well you only have so much time to work with. Time management is one of the most important skills you can learn.
33708,The most important thing is to realize you need improvement. Some people like to blame everything else but themself!
33709,"Maybe you unconsciously wanted to wear it. Maybe you have some hidden desires your subconscious wanted to explore for you? What if you went and did it again the next day, to see if you liked it?"
33710,"It's time to go online and buy some summer dresses for yourself. Explore your femininity, man. It's 2018. Anything goes. Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner, etc. Summer isn't over. Put those hairy legs on display and strut your stuff in those dresses. Get flowery ones, too!"
33711,Whoop Whoop! That's awesome! I hope you get the job.
33712,No problem! Is this a career like job?
33713,What band is it?
33714,"Yeah, it's weird going back to college."
33715,"Oh yeah, bad influences.  When I look at my student loan payments, I don't miss college."
33716,"Okay, so I never understood why people ate it. What is it about it that makes them want to do that? I just flicked mine. And I thought it stopped at a child's age. Really interesting."
33717,"I've heard of oral fixations before, but only in the context of like chewing fingernails and smoking cigarettes, etc. But I guess if I think about it, a lot of people chew fingernails, and I'm sure that's just as bad bacteria-wise. Maybe the booger eaters are on to something."
33718,That must have been unbearable. Did you complain to the staff about the smell?
33719,"Good, I would avoid that airline too."
33720,That is a terrible feeling. I saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home. That would be the worst.
33721,Well I hope everything turned out ok. Maybe you can send a friend to check your door.
33722,Avatar the Airbender or James Cameroons Avatar?
33723,Ah yes it has been a long time since that movie came out! It has some of the best CGI ever.
33724,They just didnt play like a team and its no surprise that happened.
33725,"I hope so, they shouldnt be getting beat like that. "
33726,"Uh I would have called the police, did they have a reaon?"
33727,"I wish I could relate, but I've never had to go to court. I hope it goes smoothly for you. All I've ever heard is to dress appropriately and to speak as respectfully as you can as possible. "
33728,"I hope for your sake that you don't have to, either. But this doesn't have to define you. How you respond can, though. If you're mentally tough, it will be a bump in the road. I guess do whatever you can to maintain healthy focus."
33729,Haha good timing by your roommate. Does he not knock?
33730,Hahahaa that's funny. I am sure you can install a lick pretty easily if the door is wooden.
33731,I bet it brings back lots of great memories.
33732,I do nit think I have heard of that game. Was it pretty popular?
33733,How does that make you feel?
33734,"I am sorry, I am sure he is just being nice for the sake of not getting in trouble!"
33735,That is always a drag. I hope it is routine and nothing serious.
33736,Oh yeah I know what you mean about hospitals. They are always so busy and you see lots of sick people.
33737,I totally know what you mean.
33738,You also need some good pickup lines.
33739,Did she ever embarass you out in public?
33740,"Yikes, I hope they did not take that to heart too much..."
33741,My girls seem to like the Pokemon Go game - is this a new one?
33742,Tell me more about it - maybe it will be something my girls will like also.
33743,Wow! What was the dog doing or what was the show about?
33744,"Nice, I love watching cute dogs doing cool things!"
33745,"That is crazy, how did they get separated?"
33746,"Oh wow, best of luck with that!"
33747,I am sure you deserve it for all the hard work you do. I will send in my recommendation.
33748,"Sure, I wish there were more employees like you with such a strong work ethic."
33749,How much money did you make with it? I assume most people would have sold before the peak out of fear of it crashing
33750,"Holy cow, congratualtions, that sure is smart of you!"
33751,"Well still, it takes bravery!"
33752,Interesting...lol
33753,I can't believe i made this much money with bitcoin.
33754,"I am so sorry. I just recently lost my mother after years of her having alzheimer's. I wish there was some way I could help you, it is such a tough road."
33755,"You are completely fine needing some time. There is nothing fair about something that takes your best friend and turns them into a stranger. Be there with her, but you have to take time to recharge yourself. No one can be strong all the time."
33756,That game was suprising. The browns of all teams lol
33757,Yea true and they used their back ups moostly. Foles is having a rough start.
33758,What coaster did you ride?
33759,"I have never heard of that, is it twisty or a big drop?"
33760,"I just got done traveling myself! There's no better feeling than the anticipating of traveling. I love airports, especially, because of all the people-watching and the general atmosphere. I hope your trip goes smoothly!"
33761,"Oh, gotcha. My mix-up. Driving and road trips can still be just as fun. Kinda stinks if you're the only one driving, but at least you can come up with games to play. Plus.. it's cheaper. that's always nice."
33762,Oh man I bet summer went by quick for you then.  Did you have fun together?
33763,Yeah.  That sucks you guys are apart now :(    I'd love to do a mountain trip like that though.
33764,It'll be OK :) How long does this busyness usually last for?
33765,Oh that's not tooo bad...can you take your vacation during that time?
33766,Why did you move?
33767,"oh, well it will come!"
33768,Some people have better cards then we do in life. It's how you play your cards though.
33769,Humans can't help that. But its what makes us strive to be better!
33770,Why did you get a cat?
33771,"They are, I hope yours behaves better in time"
33772,"That is terrible, I hope things get better for you both"
33773,He should be recovered by the early part of the season.
33774,"Yeah, the Foles injury is more worrying."
33775,"It's hard for me to empathize since I'm just in college right now. But my girlfriend is in a line of work that is the same way, and I hate to see her get so stressed out and all of her time eaten away because of work. I try to give her her space and to be understanding. Hopefully people do that with you, too."
33776,"Well, if there's any way you can give them insight to what you're dealing with, so that they better understand, I would do it. My girlfriend spent 10 mins one day explaining to me what she dealt with, and it went a long way for me to not bother her as much about it"
33777,"I get that, I have had jobs like that, some people just thrive on drama, they do not enjoy anything more than that"
33778,"I understand that, that is a great move by you, do not get sucked in"
33779,Eh give him a dollar and tell him to enter the contest himself.
33780,He doesn't sound too reasonable if you ask me.
33781,"I hate sayings, but the one that goes, ""Tough times don't last, but tough people do,"" really applies. Life is long. You have plenty of time to change your fortune, and you seem self aware enough to do it. I hope you can work your way back up."
33782,"Of course, but it doesn't really matter what I say, or what I think. You already knew all that stuff anyway. Everyone has to have confidence in themselves. Someone else's confidence makes no difference. But as long as you're alive, you've got a chance."
33783,Why is it a great day?
33784,"Wow, that is so cute, I hope he gets trained quickly!"
33785,How did you break the TV?
33786,Did your parents get mad at you?
33787,"Wow, I can't even imagine. What caused the fire?"
33788,Were you home when it started?
33789,Did you study for it?
33790,"Great then! You can ace any ""hard"" test as long as you put in the work and time! I hope you did well."
33791,Me too! What is your favorite part?
33792,I agree with you. I cannot wait. It is such a fun time
33793,Cool!  What are you all gonna do? 
33794,That's awesome!!  I hope you have fun and be safe!
33795,"I know right, some printers are just terrible."
33796,I can feel your frustration. 
33797,"Oh wow, I love thunderstorms.... though I know they make some people really uncomfortable. "
33798,It's always good to be nice and prepared for anything. Better safe than sorry they always say. Good for you.
33799,Wow...Are you ok?
33800,Oh haha when you say pit bull i immediately think it could be a violent occurrence. I'm glad you are ok:)
33801,I hope it works out for you!
33802,Be a gentleman and you will be golden.
33803,Yikes!  Did you find out who it was?
33804,Man that's awful.  Did you file a police report?
33805,I bet you found some cool stuff
33806,Oh wow! Those were fun. Did you play it?
33807,I love Legos! They have gotten expensive though.
33808,"Yeah, thinking about old toys makes me somewhat sad."
33809,WOW!  All by himself in one sitting??
33810,Are you hoping to do the same thing???!
33811,Haha. Which one were you rooting for?
33812,Were you disappointed that they lost?
33813,"Oh that's quite luck and fortunate for you, I've never had a lost wallet returned."
33814,I don't blame you. 
33815,Yuck!  I hate when friends do that!
33816,Yeah I don't blame you.  Time to find some new friends!
33817,Oh that's a standard prcedure. Have you ever had one?
33818,Everything will be fine:)
33819,Did you ease your nerves?
33820,I'm glad everything worked out for you!
33821,Sometimes solitude can be a good thing. Were you hoping for company?
33822,Call me next time and I will go with you.
33823,have you been contacted by the IRS?
33824,well id say no news is good news
33825,"Awwww, that's so sad. Was he lost?"
33826,Good job! There need to be more people like you in this world.
33827,American football or soccer?
33828,Yeah I bet.  Are you a Browns fan or something?
33829,"That sounds like a bummer, what brand?"
33830,Too bad you don't have a pond you can throw it into.
33831,shees! some people just dont understand some things others just dont care to talk about
33832,it happens everywhere. some poeple are just too dense to realize . 
33833,Wowza...how did it go?
33834,Oh gosh....that is embarrassing. Were you able to recover? lol
33835,It's smart to play it safe. Sometimes we are unable to predict what other humans are capable of.
33836,You seem very smart;0
33837,What a loyal dog! They are such good creatures. We humans don't deserve them. 
33838,I'm glad he was there to protect you! Hopefully it doesn't happen again because that's very scary. 
33839,Did you take it back?
33840,Dang.  Did you eat it or throw it away?
33841,"No, tell me about it!"
33842,"Yeah, eggplant is pretty gross."
33843,"I'm so sorry to hear that. It will get better, though. "
33844,Going to the gym or taking up a hobby can make you feel more confident and motivated.
33845,Oh no! I am so sorry. was he old?
33846,Wow! Sounds like he had a full life. You are a good pet owner.:)
33847,Hey congrats!!!  Hows being a parent working
33848,Yeah I've always heard that about kiddos.  Congrats and good luck!  I'm sure you will be an awesome parent!! :D
33849,You're welcome.  I think I hear a baby crying.  You better go check on that :D
33850,That must be such a relief!
33851,"In a way, it is actually just the beginning."
33852,They didn't even eat it! How dare they!!
33853,"Oh, what car was it?  Are you jealous?"
33854,That is a sweet ride!
33855,thats good! how old is he?
33856,congratulations! parenting done right!
33857,haha.  Where they mad?  and how did you react?
33858,Yeah I bet.  I would be too.  How embarassing 
33859,OH NO! How so?
33860,Haha i agree. Hopefully you can make it through it without too much anxiety.
33861,"WOW that's always a good news! i do love my pizza, and  i am guessing you do too!"
33862,oh god! make sure you post a lot of pictures and give updates on the taste! you must be so excited
33863,Nice! He must be pretty good.
33864,Nice. You must be pretty happy for him. Will you go to his games?
33865,What job are you starting?
33866,Do you get a big raise too?
33867,"you know something worker_1, everytime you feel good about something, it always means that you did good! take for example myself, when i had my job interview i also felt really good about it and guess what? I GOT THE JOB! "
33868,that's good news indeed! i wish you the best and make sure you work hard! 
33869,"You certainly are lucky to have a dad, me too!"
33870,I wish everyone was that lucky.
33871,How much did you end up saving?
33872,"That's amazing, who did you switch too?"
33873,"Oh, wow.  Are you happy for him?"
33874,"Yeah, we all get jealous sometimes."
33875,You are a good friend! Are you nervous?
33876,Nice. I wish i had more friends like you.
33877,Congratulations! What will be his name?
33878,That is such a manly name if I ever heard one.
33879,"aww,,, poor pupper. what happend?"
33880,good vibes going out to your good boy
33881,AYYY that's great news! was it a calculator test? or a non calculator one/
33882,who needs a calculator with a brain like that ey? good job that's amazing news
33883,Was she impressed?
33884,"That's a good idea, maybe take her on a cute date sometime as well?"
33885,Ouch! I am sorry to hear that!
33886,"That's just evil, no matter what the circumstances may be. I'd never do that."
33887,the best thing a human being can do
33888,"yup, i love doing that what show did you end up watch?"
33889,"Oh that's funny, I actually just had it for lunch today. I'd highly recommend it."
33890,"I think as long as you go to a trustable place (not a grocery store-style sushi joint) that makes it fresh and right in front of you, you'll be less likely to get sick (I never have)."
33891,That must have been so relaxing!
33892,I wish summer would never end.
33893,"oh damn, what ended up happening after?"
33894,"what the what? why it's not such a big deal, it happens everyday "
33895,"Oh no, what happened to your cat?"
33896,I am so sorry for your loss.
33897,That's awesome that you have friends that will do that for you.
33898,Are you ok. Did you need to go to the hospital?
33899,I have never spilled a hot drink on myself before. Weird how that happens.
33900,Oh no that sounds like a nightmare. Did you get it back?
33901,Ugh that makes me so angry. I hope the police can help you out in some way.
33902,"ouch, that's annoying, why don't you talk to him about it?"
33903,Oh really? What was it?
33904,That's nice. Congratulations on the gift. It's a useful one!
33905,Which beach?!
33906,"You must be excited, have you been there before?"
33907,oh? what on earth happend ?
33908,oh that's nothing! i thought it was something serious 
33909,sounds like you really enjoy this game. does is seem promising?
33910,"to be completely honest with you, i never played that game. but i hope it will come out soon!"
33911,oh what team? that's some very good news man! good job!
33912,"i love playing basketball, especially cause i have the height advantage too "
33913,is he okay? why did you have to do that? is he awake now?
33914,that is so sad
33915,Uh ohhh.  When is it gonna be your turn?!
33916,Wonder if it would help if I call your boss and tell him to give you a raise?
33917,I will write him a strongly worded letter!
33918,Hey we gotta get you some money somehow!
33919,Oh that's nice! How did that go?
33920,That's great! I bet he had a lot of fun too!
33921,did you have fun? what did you eat? 
33922,"eating outside every once in a while can always be needed to change your mood , glad you had fun!"
33923,omg that's such an amazing news! good job! what is your next goal
33924,"oh my apologies, i misread that one, are you proud and happy for him?"
33925,WHAT! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT 
33926,"you better be! i hope you learned your lesson though, we all make mistakes but we need to learn from them "
33927,oh really? Im not the biggest football fan
33928,sounds like a fun time sports can get intense
33929,I hope you do well on it.
33930,Give it all of your best.
33931,what what happend next? what was it? did you decide too explore this further?
33932,"omg that sounds so adventurous, if i were you i'd ask them to take me where ever they are going, cause damn anything is better than this place were living ay? "
33933,"i love cliff diving, was it your first experience ? and if so how did you find it"
33934,"wow that's amazing man, first time for me was so amazing too and are you planning to go again?"
33935,"oh damn, that sucks so much, i am sorry, but if he is your good friend you should be happy for him, maybe something better awaits you"
33936,"i know you are, and it takes a lot of practice to remove this feeling, but it's a bad feeling to have and you should look for other chances"
33937,That can be daunting. I hope you are prepared.
33938,That will be great. Soon we will be able to call you Attorney At Law. It's so exciting.
33939,"Yeah, kids grow up so fast these days."
33940,I don't like thinking about the past for that very reason.
33941,are you excited for this?
33942,you should be more confident in your abilities! i am sure you'll make an amazing bean dip
33943,How exciting? What position will he be playing?
33944,"That is always so much fun, and the kids love having people there to watch them. "
33945,"Me too, and good luck to him."
33946,"that's good, the first week is always the hardest, but it get's easier and funnier as time goes by"
33947,best of luck to you! i hope everything goes well 
33948,"aww, i am so sorry for your lost, i know this is a very hard time for you"
33949,"i am sorry again, what are you hoping to do now? "
33950,were you in a hurry to be somewhere?
33951,hmmm but why did you go 1 mile over/
33952,"Wow, how long ago was that? I wish it still was."
33953,I'd definitely agree to that. Better times.
33954,Oh cool! Which one did you get?
33955,"Wow, I just got the NES one.  They are so nostalgic."
33956,"aww that's so sweet of you to do, did she enjoy that?"
33957,even the smallest things can make the biggest different in the world! she is lucky to have a person like you
33958,i did also . it was fun
33959,yes. the good ol days
33960,That is the confidence to have!
33961,I hope you ace that test!
33962,oh really? care to tell me what on earth happend?
33963,"oh damn, that's an embarrassing one, tired morning? it's fine these things happend"
33964,oh really? what movie?
33965,"that sounds so fun !  love murder and comedy, sounds like you're going to have a blast"
33966,yeah? nothing interesting happend whatsoever? why not make it exciting yourself?
33967,"damn, any plans for next week?"
33968,"buying newspaper? 21st century? sold out? whatt that's a first for me, here they practically give it away for free and we still have many more left, maybe you can use your phone or tablet to view it? "
33969,"oh man, don't worry if you google free coupoins there are bunch! that's what i do"
33970,"ah the good ol high hopes go watch a movie come out disappointed, i totally get ya man, what movie? "
33971,"oh yes! the meg, my colleague from work was disapointed beyond repair, he was telling us all not to watch it, i guess in a sense i am lucky"
33972,I think that's a wonderful attitude to have!
33973,I hope they are as well. I do love some fishing.
33974,"Oh my, what did you see?  A mess I presume?"
33975,Oh no that is definitely something you don't want to be surprised by.
33976,what happend? tell me
33977,"that's sad news, i am sorry for this news you must have been extra drained after coming back from work from that news"
33978,"I'm sorry, who was Stefan?"
33979,"Oh okay, now I know.  Yeah that was tragic."
33980,yikes that pretty bad
33981,Oh no that is horrible! Did you call the police?
33982,That's good. I'm sorry that terrible thing happened to you.
33983,oh man. i dont like the dentist . is it a normal cleaning and check up or something more?
33984,"well, that sounds good, hopefully there won't be a lot of pain."
33985,it'll be fine. don't worry.
33986,why did you do that? wasn't there a toilet or something?
33987,that must've been embarrassing. you should've went to the toilet.
33988,oh what went wrong?
33989,"thats a fuckin bummer, hope you left her"
33990,It's always great to have friends that are willing to help out when you need them the most.
33991,When are you expecting to move?
33992,thats sounds horrifying
33993,hopefully nothing too bad happened
33994,Ah that sucks. Did they have a good reason to do so?
33995,Yes I would be too. I'd let my friend know that I don't appreciate being treated that way.
33996,Were you able to replace it before he found out?
33997,I think that would be the best option.  Nothing worse to be thirsty and have your taste buds set on something and it's not there.
33998,"Ah yes, do other members cause some trouble for you?"
33999,That is indeed frustrating. A little appreciation and recognition is what they need to give you I think.
34000,why did you have to send it back? what happend
34001,good thing you returned it! rare or whatever they call it meat is actually very dangerous for you espcially coming from a restaurant good thing you did that!
34002,not cool! i love monsters! i hate when my girlfriend takes the last one
34003,that is good to hear!
34004,What's that?
34005,What kind is it?  I have a bad one too by the way.
34006,Are you going to be on the news when you win??
34007,Yeah!  When you win I get first crack at your autograph!
34008,thats nice to hear
34009,"oh really? I just had some myself today, love sushi"
34010,That sounds like it was a gross situation. I bet it has hard to clean.
34011,"It can always happen with pets and it is a drag to clean, I know. My dog has done it more than once."
34012,How did you do on your test?  Did you find out?
34013,What course did you test for?
34014,thats awesome good for you
34015,im glad thats the case
34016,"oh god that's annoying, the same thing happned to me for my iphone case, they got me the smaller one isntead of the normal big size one, so annoyed"
34017,ayyy that's a win isn't it? but still annoying but  at least you getting it for free now
34018,sounds like youre going on vacation!
34019,where are you going? i haven't taken a vacation in a long time
34020,"grandma's food always brings back memories, for some reasons they taste very nostalgic."
34021,it was so simple back then right? not having to worry about anything but enjoying life.
34022,oh really? that's very coincidental because my son also started football this year are you happy?
34023,i know! they grow so fast and i didn't think i'd use that overly used word but god it's so true
34024,Oh that's awful!  Maybe you can try to return it and say it came like that LOL
34025,It's a little funny
34026,That's great! It feels good when you can get a little back from the things you have invested so much in!
34027,"Definitely! Plus, gets some of the clutter out of your home, I guess to make room for more."
34028,WHAT WAS THE SHOCK?
34029,oh my god! that's so bad what did you do ?
34030,Why?  What is going on?
34031,Sounds like you need a vacation
34032,what makes you think so? i'm pretty sure you aren't.
34033,that doesn't make you a failure! you are doing more than enough and i'm pretty sure she appreciate every single thing you're doing for her.
34034,Oh wow!  Congrats!!  What are you hoping for?
34035,That is so awesome!  How old are they?
34036,its always good to get away and reset
34037,did you make a check list and double check it?
34038,I'm sorry?  What happened?
34039,That's awful.  I hate when that happens. 
34040,really? like how? what she do?
34041,"don't worry, with people like this karma hits them very very hard, and they get what they deserve "
34042,Were you driving or walking?
34043,I hope they caught the person who almost hit you. That kind of incident can leave you traumatized for a long time.
34044,oof thats not a fun siutation
34045,thats a vivid description haha
34046,"that's nice, wanna share this wonderful experience with me?"
34047,wow! that is such a wonderful thing to do indeed! i am proud of you
34048,That's amazing! I do not (so far) but i hope to some day.
34049,Thanks! I appreciate it. I am really happy for you though! That's one of the best things to feel in life I am sure.
34050,"Oh wow, that must have been scary!  I'm terrified of snakes!"
34051,The only time I've seen one up close is when a professional was handling one.  I prefer to keep a distance.
34052,did you call the police? or did you do what needed to be done?
34053,"well , glad it wasn't something important. it was just a cat. and you are safe. so that is great!"
34054,What if what?  What has you so fearful?
34055,Maybe a career in astro-physics is in your future?
34056,wow! that's amazing what did she do?
34057,"oh god yes, they grow so fast next thing you know she's taking care of you and you are all old haha it's so wonderful"
34058,"That's great! Is there a particular reason, or just in general?"
34059,that's so great! cONGRATS!
34060,Any particular reason that made you do that?
34061,"Right, well we can all get that way sometimes. I'd just tell your friend directly that you weren't feeling up to it."
34062,thats really nice
34063,sushi is the best
34064,Is there no way to get in touch with anyone?
34065,Why are you alone in a room? Do you need me to come over?
34066,really? why is that?
34067,wow! that is next level smartness and thinking! good job
34068,i am lucky to have someone like my fiancee too! what makes you so grateful about your fiancee
34069,it's probably the best feeling on earth right?
34070,thats super cool
34071,thats impressive good luck to her
34072,"I can't wait either, I am looking forward to it as well.  Do you know when the release date is?"
34073,CoD 4 comes out in about two weeks I think.
34074,i agree. everyone seems to be out for themself and do not care to help other or take others into consideration
34075,yeah its a tought thing to have to deal with
34076,oh god! how much did he rip you off by?
34077,"oh, so what are you going to do about this?"
34078,"this happens a lot at work, maybe try to talk to them about it? "
34079,i agree everyone is just self-centered and it's very annoying to communicate with those people.
34080,How do you feel about it? Ready?
34081,"Just do your best you can, and that way you won't have any regrets no matter what the result is."
34082,yea i know that feel its the same for me right now
34083,You must really trust them. I hope it turned out well.
34084,Now you know who to call when you want to go away again.
34085,Oh yeah my brother would always get some things I wanted too. Made me feel jealous. 
34086,That's even worse. Well I hope you at least got to ride it when she wasn't looking!
34087,oh wow that sounds nice
34088,i just did last week actually
34089,oh no! why didn't you do anything about it?
34090,snitch? is that actually still a thing?
34091,oh wow! what was the discovery?
34092,mind. blown. that sounds breath taking
34093,oh god! that must have been so scary 
34094,"oh god! just hand them what they want, it's not worth your life"
34095,wow thats very faithful of you
34096,not really but i can respect it
34097,"awww that's so sweet of them, are you guys close?"
34098,"that's so nice, are you looking forward to uni?"
34099,yep almost everyday because of my fiancee. what about you?
34100,"i know, there's nothing like true love ."
34101,As in a grade?
34102,That can happen sometimes even when you are prepared. It's like test anxiety. Has it happened before?
34103,How did you end up doing?
34104,How well? I'm proud of you for that my man.
34105,what? what did you do/
34106,"that's so nice! good thing you do, we need more people like you, all these normies nowadays just sleeping around and only chasing after cannibalistic desires  "
34107,What happened!
34108,"You must be upset, are you okay do you need any help?"
34109,oh did it go well?
34110,huh sounds quite intimate
34111,Are you nervous of meeting new friends?
34112,I think you should look to join a club in school!
34113,yes! i live about 30 mins away from the coast . i love going at night
34114,"yes, i love when the water is flat and its just a glassy reflection. i also love when the water is rough and loug"
34115,aww that's so nice! did you have the biggest smile on your face/
34116,that makes me so happy! you blessed my day! i can't wait to see my son do that too
34117,why was he beating you?
34118,"oh what an abusive person, how did yo ustop him?"
34119,"I'm sorry to hear that, can you make it up to them?"
34120,You should try to reach out to them.
34121,i hope it wasn't an important and you still managed to pass everything. why did that happen?
34122,"don't worry about it, maybe it was the teacher's fault . but since you're okay and everything is fine there's no point in worrying about it."
34123,Tell me what has you so worked up?
34124,I am so sorry. I know right now your mind is spinning and everything is chaotic. You need to sit somewhere and let your mind settle down.
34125,"That's a good idea, what do you need to buy?"
34126,"That's smart, I love a big turkey dinner the family will be pleased I bet."
34127,What did you decide to do instead?
34128,"That's lucky of you, do you plan on being a pharmacy tech?"
34129,what else would you do if you didnt go?
34130,that sounds like good money
34131,Did you try going to any clubs to meet anyone?
34132,You should consider trying to network though it's worth it.
34133,thats nice of you
34134,why does it creep you out? i think it's pretty good
34135,you could always try sushi bowls. 
34136,why is that? what happend?
34137,"it's okay! if you really want to do it you will do it strength isn't all physical your real strength is the will to do! if you have that, the 15 push ups can be turned to 100!"
34138,Just once. If the car had not died I would have hit a building.
34139,I know that feeling for sure. I freaked out because I could not remember how to use the brake. 
34140,Did you make it home in time?
34141,"That is so lame, what caused you to be so late? Just the lights?"
34142,"awww, that's so sweet i aspire to be like you with my fiance, i will sooon get married! what re you guys planning to do? and what's your guys secret for holding a relationship for so long?"
34143,"i know she is the one, we are identical in every way, i am the only person who understands her and she is the only one who understands me, we communicate about everything and we are both non normies!"
34144,what did he won? were you hoping for some help?
34145,"it's insane how people can be so selfish once they see money, een your own father becomes a monster. don't let it bother you."
34146,yikes! that's a load to clean isn't it?
34147,"i know! my cats are a hell to take care of as well, one always poops in the kitchen while the other one chases off my pigeons, it's really annoying"
34148,what letter? please share this experience with me
34149,"oh wow! that is such good news! i am so happy for you, what are you going to study there?"
34150,"wow that's so motivating to hear, what inspires you to become a police officer"
34151,"yeah, i hope you be one of the good cops, not like the current ones"
34152,did you just move back?
34153,i miss waking up to my moms big breakfasts. i actually live a block away from her
34154,What kind of restaurant was it?
34155,"I do love a good burrito, I should go check it out some time."
34156,"go on! tell me about it, let's hear it"
34157,that's so disgusting you are disgusting
34158,"how long did you have your dog for? that must've been very painful, losing a pet is always hard"
34159,that's a lot of time. you could say he was part of your family. 
34160,With those kind of people you just have to be blunt. If that doesn't work then it's time to excuse yourself from the conversation.
34161,You are usually left with no other option.
34162,were they good memories?
34163,yes i love that feeling
34164,"Oh, I""m sorry to hear that! I know how hard that can be to lose a loved pet."
34165,"Well, I hope you feel better soon!"
34166,How exciting! What is he planning on doing next?
34167,"That's impressive, is he hoping to play professionally?"
34168,fun jobs with good pay do exist
34169,that does make sense
34170,"Oh, it's crazy what some people will try. But, sometimes an argument can get very interesting to watch!"
34171,"I don't really blame the driver. Plus, that's annoying delay in everybody's busy day."
34172,"I understand! I felt the same when my son left, it's seems so much less noise and talk."
34173,A good friend is hard to find.
34174,Do you have a best friend?
34175,How long have you been friends?
34176,Yeah but we aren't as close as we used to be.
34177,yes. this situation happened every friends relation.due to this we are in relation with a family members
34178,don't worry all the friends are came to you be happy
34179,"yes, one friend"
34180,2 years later i spoke to him
34181,that could def be an improvemnt. what kind did you have in mind
34182,good choices. which are you leaning towards?
34183,Was it a suprise?
34184,Where is he living now? Have you heard from him at least?
34185,i really do hate that stuff
34186,its a sick sad world
34187,I know you have really been looking forward to this. Where did you decide on going?
34188,My niece went there and loved it. Are you flying in or taking a cruise?
34189,Were you able to return it?
34190,Does it fit. Id just have them send me a new one when it comes back in stock. Its their mistake.
34191,did he go home with you?
34192,boo. poor pupper
34193,"Oh, no! Well, it happens sometimes, we get so busy and don't notice. "
34194,"Life gets us out of whack, don't feel bad. I'm sure you can pay for it next time."
34195,"that's fantastic! It certainly is a great feeling, financial freedom!"
34196,That's so great!
34197,left until what?
34198,that sounds like a lot of fun
34199,What was sketchy about it?
34200,Yikes.  Did you end up placing the order?
34201,What was it it?
34202,You cant be serious.
34203,You definitely made my day.
34204,Well good luck with whatever is out there.
34205,Are you currently saving up?
34206,I bet.  How far south of the continent are you?
34207,Cool.  I have a friend that lives in Brazil
34208,Thats awesome!!  Tell Gabi I said hi when you go :D
34209,That's a good thing. Lying to the police opens a whole world of trouble.
34210,Especially if it involves going to jail.
34211,How did you cut your hand?
34212,Did you lose any fingers?
34213,Did you get hurt doing the robbery?
34214,How long ago did this occur?
34215,Are you going because someone else wants to or was it something that you wanted to do?
34216,If you don't have any choice then I suggest you bring earplugs.
34217,Oh no did people look at you judgingly?
34218,"Well you can learn from it, and be better for it."
34219,Whow! That is one mean car!   What did your friend say?
34220,That must be quite exciting to drive around in those supercars!
34221,That is great. What are you studying?
34222,Good luck
34223,Whats the distance?
34224,How does one prepare for a marathon? By running? 
34225,What kind of feelings?
34226,More than anything?! More than cats?? You must really love her!
34227,I hope you didn't listen to them.
34228,"Nice, you must do whatever you want each day."
34229,Hopefully all of your hard work will pay off and you will do well.
34230,All you can do is do your best and whatever happens after that at least you will know that you gave it your all.
34231,I understand. Did you finally took them skating?
34232,I understand. Those things happened.
34233,Did you run into any problems?
34234,That's a lot of questions. How did the rest of the trip turn out?
34235,Is it your first time there?
34236,"I do love a good beach, I was just in the Philippines and they have some of the best beaches Ive ever seen."
34237,That was nice of you. Is she still alive?
34238,Sorry about her death. At least you enjoyed your time with her.
34239,How that happened?
34240,Maybe your cat started a family somewhere in nature)
34241,Do you know who stole it?
34242,"Maybe it will turn up, who knows."
34243,Are you playing?
34244,I understand. What is the name of your team?
34245,WHat kind of car is it?
34246,That is one awesome car!  Don't be too jealous!  Just start saving your money!
34247,Wow. That sounds exciting. You should do fine.
34248,What kind of motorcycle did you buy?
34249,"About to, what happened?"
34250,Is your name Kim by any chance?
34251,Uhoh.  I'm assuming it was not safely returned to you?
34252,Fanny packs for the win!
34253,Yes but that is how it goes sometimes.
34254,All you can do it work hard and try to make more money.
34255,That is great. Are you working?
34256,Is it a little bit complicated to have two jobs?
34257,You are wonderful just the way you are! Be happy that you are alive and healthy and beautiful! I am sure your brother wishes he could have something of yours too.
34258,It is all in your head. What makes you think being tall is any funner? :)
34259,I hope you had insurance.
34260,"Sure, it must be a real pain to be in your imaginary shoes."
34261,Oh I hope nothing bad came from that?
34262,Yeah that can be stressful.
34263,"That's really hard to do. I should do the same thing, but I still start my day with a big glass of iced coffee every day. It could help though."
34264,I can imagine. That is really great that you are able to follow his advice and maybe each day will get a little bit better. Anxiety is the worst!
34265,Good luck. What class?
34266,Whats your major?
34267,Sometime you got to pay for quality.
34268,Hopefully you can save up and get a pair.
34269,I hope you did. Is it one that you really wanted ?
34270,Patience paid off for you then hopefully.
34271,I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you be fine.
34272,We all go through tough times. It will work out for you in the end.
34273,"Wow, what a thrilling sport. Yeah, I sure hope he knows what he's doing. You life depends on it!"
34274,You are certainly brave my friend. I don't have the guts to ever do that! Be safe!
34275,Why can't you play? That must be very disappointing.
34276,Ouch! I'm so sorry. How long until you can play again?
34277,"haha, why did you go on?  peer pressure?"
34278,That makes sense!  I bet it didn't go as bad as you think!
34279,Is that good or bad?
34280,Maybe you should child proof the house.
34281,I know. Those were the days. 
34282,I liked going to Blockbuster picking out movies.
34283,"That sucks, did the house get any damage?"
34284,"That is good, at least you were prepared."
34285,"That's great, hope you get it! But, seems you have much on your plate already."
34286,"Oh, I see, well that sounds better for sure. Good luck, and I hope you will get it."
34287,"Oh, no. Do you have a plan B ?"
34288,"Think of it this way. If you had waited, you wouldn't have been able to get the house. Dig in and fight too keep it."
34289,That is no good!  Why have you been feeling so sad and depressed?
34290,Wow!  That does sound like a lot of misfortune!  Just try your best to think positive if you can.  You never know what the future has in store for you!
34291,That must have been so cool to drive around in a ferrari. Was it fun?
34292,I bet. What color Ferrari do you have? Be careful not to drive to fast now
34293,Oh no! He doesn't seem like such a good friend then. I hate it when friends pull stuff like that!
34294,That sucks! He definitely appears he was trying to avoid you. Well one day he will need something and you can give him a taste of his own medicine. lol 
34295,That is terrible. Did you call the police?
34296,I understand. I hate when that happened.
34297,That is so scary. Did he destroy anything?
34298,I would have been too. Was there more than one?
34299,Most people do not possess those qualities these days.  That is quite honorable of you.  Being faithful is quite important!
34300,You should be.  I am sure your family appreciates it as well!
34301,"I understand, my parents are 85 and 88, both with dementia."
34302,I'm glad it's that way for you. My parents destroyed my life intentionally years ago.
34303,Nice! Sounds like you will be successful then! I think you will do great!
34304,"Hahaha, nerds are cool these days, haven't you heard? Sounds like you are on the road to success!"
34305,That must be very difficult to have to wait for results. I hope they come back and everything is fine though.
34306,"Yes, that is not fun at all. I've been there and it's hard not to think about anything else. I really wish you the very best"
34307,That's so great!  You seem quite content.
34308,"That's so cool.  I think I would feel the same way, except I was dumb in my 20s and still have student debt!  lol"
34309,That's interesting.  Why on Earth would she want it back?
34310,That is crazy!  There has to be an explaination!
34311,I'm in that boat right now too. I feel it's going to be a long time coming.
34312,I hope you can hang on for something better.
34313,I dont have any kids. I want to adopt one day.
34314,Im happy for you.
34315,"Yeah, it was fun...and so free."
34316,"I lived in an apartment complex and there was a pool, so I loved swimming."
34317,There is nothing better than being content.
34318,That makes you feel safe.
34319,Oh yikes! That is a scary thing to witness. It is good to be safe these days with so many people using phones while driving and even walking. It is dangerous out there and you never know what can happen to you at any moment.
34320,"Yes, be safe my friend! I am sure you will because of your hands on experience with what you saw."
34321,That's not good!  Have you considered going to rehab?
34322,Maybe a different facility could help?  Addiction isn't something you can deal with by yourself. 
34323,What did you? Did you return to the store?
34324,Did you have any money bet on it ?
34325,"Well, then it wasn't too bad."
34326,Not quite sure I get what youre saying. Lost as in missing?
34327,Wow. Sorry to hear. I dont know too much about dementia. 
34328,"Oh, it happens to the best of us. I have done the same a gazillion times! It doesn't get any better or funnier, lol."
34329,"Oh well, just know that everybody in the world has fallen a few times. The most important thing is you just get up and keeping walking. :)"
34330,Was it a large one ?
34331,That is great. Is it a big one?
34332,Wow. It is a great raise. Your employer should have impressed by you.
34333,"Oh, wow, that is absolutely terrible! I can imagine it was horrifying for you."
34334,"Was he dead, or just injured badly? I wouldn't be sure what to really do either. "
34335,Uh oh! That is not a good sign! Do you think they are going to call it quits?
34336,It is good to have these kinds of keep sakes. Maybe the rings can even be used again in a family wedding.
34337,"that sounds like it is going to be a super trip, you'll have a blast"
34338,"Boston is a great place to visit, makes sure you have some chowdah  :)"
34339,"Yes, death is always a tough thing to deal with especially when they are close like parents. But that life and every single person on this planet will have to deal with that at some point in life. It is just the nature of life."
34340,"Oh, what a bad pain to carry. I hope that you are happy though. Your parents will want you to always stay happy.They are in a better place now."
34341,"Oh, how cute! I love animals, especially puppies!"
34342,"Oh, yuck! They will do that, but sure don't want puppy kisses later."
34343,"That's good. I know it's very expensive to replace that part, so I'm sure you are relieved."
34344,"Yes, for sure! I always prefer repairs over replacement if possible."
34345,"That would make me nervous! you never know what kind of person it could be, a predator perhaps."
34346,True!
34347,That is always a great feeling! I love gardening! What did you plant?
34348,Oh yum!! That should grow nicely this time of year. You should definitely can all the extra tomatoes you get this year. It will be great in winter soups and stews. :)
34349,I am sorry to hear about all the layoffs.  I will pray for you at Church for you to keep your job.  What do you do for work?
34350,How long have you been an accountant?
34351,The weather is terrible here also. I hate that. Are you on the east side of America?
34352,That is bad. What are you planning to do the rest of the day?
34353,Oh that is a tough period. Poor baby! But with mammas love everything is alright. You are such a great mother!
34354,"Yeah, hopefully they have invented something that helps with the pain for the teething. Hopefully is is natural."
34355,"Oh no! That's terrible. What made you choose that stock, and what will you do now?"
34356,"You'll earn it all back, don't worry. For next time, though, don't listen to people who know nothing."
34357,That's great! Did you win your fight.
34358,Congrats! You trained for it so you deserved to win!
34359,"That's great! I love soccer. I grew up in Scotland, where everyone's golf and soccer crazy. How old is your son?"
34360,I bet that makes you so proud. Perhaps he'll become a professional soccer player one day!
34361,Oh no!! I hope it wasn't coffee! Yes that is pretty embarrassing. People probably thought you peed your pants.
34362,"Oh, well hopefully you learned some kind of lesson from this and it won't happen again."
34363,Oh yeah. Was the food good? What about the service?
34364,Oh my gosh! What where they serving? That makes me feel sick for you. I hate being decieved!
34365,I hate aggressive drivers. They cause the majority of the accidents.
34366,He probably had no where to go important. He was just being rude.
34367,That sounds like fun. What were you taking pictures of? I didn't know film existed anymore lol
34368,Do you take pictures professionally or just a hobby?
34369,"First Im sorry for your heartbreak, but second... its okay to be alone to let the feelings pass. How long has it been? "
34370,sounds like its time to get out and start doing something to take your mind off from it. maybe fitness? 
34371,That is great. What is it a big amount that you had to pay back?
34372,I hate having debts. 
34373,"Awe, that is a very good friend to have. You are very lucky to have a friend like that. Hopefully you are there for him too. :)"
34374,Count your lucky stars my friend! Bless you heart!
34375,That's great. It really feels great when we accomplish something and reach our goals.
34376,"I hope you do as well, that will be a big step towards a great career."
34377,That was nice of you. I hope she gave it back to you when you needed to use it yourself.
34378,That is very kind of you. There needs to be more people like you in the world!
34379,And did he pull through?
34380,I love it whern
34381,Did you all have a good time there?
34382,Haha! Rollercoasters are an exhilarating experience! I love riding them at amusement parks.
34383,Oh my...You have to be careful when you use the internet for school assignments.
34384,I know someone else that happened to. I wouldn't take anymore chances either.
34385,Weekends are beautiful if you don't work on them and have nothing to do!
34386,Enjoy the weekend as much as you can for me; I work all day today!
34387,"That sounds very scary, what happened? "
34388,"Smart move honestly, better to be with a larger group than to be alone. Glad you are ok. "
34389,How are you still friends?
34390,I have a few friends who are way better off than I am. It makes me a bit sad about my situation. 
34391,That's cool! Maybe he will be the Magic Johnson of the family. Hey you never know!
34392,Yeah all you can do is encourage and support him. I hope everything works out and that he becomes rich and famous someday! 
34393,It's great looking through old photo albums and remembering all those great times.
34394,Yeah it really is. We just slap everything on our computer or online these days. It's just not the same.
34395,Hey it happens to the best of us. Were you able to clean it up well?
34396,"Oh no that's awful! I hadn't realized it was carpet. As a clumsy person, that could've definitely been me in your situation so I get it."
34397,That's great to hear. Was it a boy or a girl?
34398,"Children are so amazing, and life changing. I hope your sister is ready for all the challenges that awake her."
34399,Oh really?! What did they find?
34400,Oh yuck!!! That is terrible! I have heard of people getting really sick from this black mold in the house. What are you going to do?
34401,I hate spiders. There is nothing worse than waking up and seeing one above you on the ceiling as you are laying in bed.
34402,Well that sounds terrible. It is time to burn your house down and start a new life elsewhere.
34403,And how did you feel about taking another person's forgotten belongings?
34404,That's a good way of seeing it I suppose.
34405,sounds like it going to be an interesting trip
34406,"i can imaging the anticipation, but before you know it, you'll be on the beach"
34407,Congratulations! I fail to see the relevance between having a good grade and shopping however. Are you being rewarded for your grades?
34408,Oh definitely! I hope your shopping day exceeds your expectations!
34409,"Was he using it or something? Why did you think it was him, and how did you find out it was you?"
34410,You have a secret spot for your headphones. Are they super expensive? 
34411,I have zero kids. I break stuff all the time. 
34412,No just ridiculously careless.
34413,I've never been there. I think it would be intimidating.
34414,My dad and uncle actually went camping down there. You go with a guide and you set up camp in a few different places.
34415,"Im the same, but I think in a place like the grand canyon, it's really dangerous to try to go down there alone."
34416,"Yes, I know I wouldn't mind riding the donkey or mule down there."
34417,Good luck. I hope you do really well during the interview.
34418,It sounds like the job is a great fit for you. I really hope you get it.
34419,Oh no that's terrible! Did you end up finding her purse?
34420,I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully your niece feels better now and hasn't lost too much.
34421,Oh dear. I am so sorry that happened to you. Were you hurt?
34422,That must have been terrifying. I am glad that you are okay.
34423,That is so annoying. Did you need it for a special occasion?
34424,I hope they at least gave you your money back.
34425,Sorry to hear that. I lost both my grandparents in the same year.
34426,From what year?
34427,I know what you mean. Me too! What was your favorite part about the 90s?
34428,Good point!
34429,How come? Is your sister a minor and are you an adult?
34430,"That doesn't sound fair at all, I wonder why she did that."
34431,"If I were you, I would ask your mom why she paid for your sisters; items and not yours. That's so mean."
34432,"Now that I think of it, it most likely is the reason why; maybe she doesn't even think of it as a mean act and maybe means no harm by it. Regardless it is important to share how you're feeling with her."
34433,That could be creepy depending on the person. I'm extra paranoid though.
34434,"That's understandable, there's just no way to be sure what a stranger's intentions are."
34435,That's great! Consistency is key!
34436,And you're building trust with your dog as well! It's a win-win. :)
34437,"Kids like touching and looking at things, I'm sure no real harm was done. People like making a big deal out of everything."
34438,I'd say ignore them as best as you can. It's normal for kids to do these kind of things!
34439,I am happy for you. How did it feel
34440,That sounds like a great experience
34441,"I am usually that way, whenever I have a doctor's appointment. I hope everything went well."
34442,Ah. There you go so you were worried about nothing. I am glad that all was well.
34443,"Oh, that's a shame - cooking's such fun. Why did you stop cooking?"
34444,"Gosh, I couldn't afford to do that! It's far cheaper for me to cook up a big pot of stew or something and freeze it for busy days."
34445,"That stuff's hard to come by! It's so easy to chuck stuff in a pot and then go watch tv or do something else for a couple of hours. Tastes better, too!"
34446,I wish I had a slow cooker. Or one of those Instant Pots everyone's raving about.
34447,It's weird the way some things from our past seem so timeless. It's nice you had a good experience seeing your school. 
34448,Our past can be a great source of strength and comfort. 
34449,Would you be able to go meet him instead?
34450,That sucks. I would be disappointed also. Hopefully yall can make some time soon to get together.
34451,Did you get any news back?
34452,"I hope you do get the job, you deserve it!"
34453,"sorry to here that, it must be tough for you at this moment"
34454,but as time passes you will find another and be cheerful as ever.
34455,Oh my dad loves football too. I bet you have some great memories.
34456,Did you and your dad ever play football together?
34457,Do you have a patio or backyard to do that in?
34458,I am so jealous of you then ha
34459,You must have been really prepared to be so certain of achieving a perfect score!
34460,"I hope you do get that perfect score, you deserve it after all!"
34461,That is really neat do you have a kid?
34462,I would go atleast you would get cake
34463,Wow! Is that old for an iguana? Im sorry to hear that
34464,My daughter wants an iguana. I am scared of animals 
34465,She is . She may be able to handle it on her own. Thanks for the info
34466,That can be frustrating. Did you do anything to help?
34467,"Oh that is terrible, cashiers should have more patience."
34468,"Was the cake that good, or were you trying to make him angry?"
34469,Maybe you could make it up to him. I'm sure he'll get over it though. 
34470,I guess he really need it. Did you give him the money? 
34471,"Well, at least you gave him something. He could buy a burger at McDonald's"
34472,Did she end up being able to go?
34473,"Well I hope she is able to attend, if not, you know it's nothing personal!"
34474,I dislike people who do that. I never understood why! Have you tried talking to him?
34475,Oh I believe you. Typically those type of people aren't people you can reason with.
34476,"I do that sometimes to you, memories are always nice"
34477,I look forward to that when I have a kid
34478,That's nice. I wish my brothers did that for me.
34479,What kind of event is it?
34480,"Ohh fun, I love the artistic nature of some. My daughter just got a tattoo in honor of me."
34481,That happened to me once. It was terrifying. Were you okay?
34482,That is true. We dont get a lot of snow here. I dont think anyone knows how to deal with it
34483,"Wow, that is unfortunate, I hope you are okay financially..."
34484,What did he get you instead?
34485,"Thats not ok I have been in that situation before and have made my girlfriend a card, wrote her a poem something. "
34486,That is not cool at all. Why would he say that? Maybe he misplaced it.
34487,That must have made you feel angry. I am sorry that happened to you but please forgive him.
34488,"I love good books, what was it about?"
34489,"That sounds really deep and dramatic, I think I would like that one. You might like books like ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" also."
34490,I love sitting on the porch when the weather is nice.
34491,"Where I live, it was really nice too. There was a cool breeze and no mosquitoes out."
34492,I imagine that would be a bit unnerving. It being dark and anything being possible.
34493,"That sounds creepy, I would have to start keeping protection with me just in case."
34494,Did she accept? I'm sure you would be great to go out with.
34495,I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you will find someone who feels the same about you.
34496,My parents are no longer living
34497,"Its okay, I have good memories"
34498,"really ,me going to get relax by having beer"
34499,"yeah,well i am not a reader but i love to play video games so much "
34500,"That is good, is he struggling now?"
34501,"Did you ask him about it, or did he make a big change to high school. Sometimes a big change or just burn out can kick in."
34502,I know the feeling. Did a lot of people see?
34503,Love is a great thing for sure
34504,Uh oh. Do you think it is something major?
34505,Well I hope it isnt too expensive. Maybe it will be a smaller issue.
34506,That's fantastic! Hopefully you'll hear something about it soon. 
34507,I'm sure you did. Think positive!
34508,How old was it ?
34509,That's terrible. I'm so sorry. You'll never forget him.
34510,"I am so sorry. I hope you can make friends, try to join some sort of activities to meet people."
34511,Are you a browns fan ?
34512,"I see, well then I'm sorry that worked out wrong for you."
34513,What problems do you need to handle?
34514,"I got you, well I hope that you get to that position at some point soon!"
34515,I do understand what you are saying. There are good cops and bad cops.
34516,"And sometimes it has to do with race, it is really a sad situation."
34517,Damn that sucks.  Well at least you can get a fresh pair
34518,That sounds so fun! I always wanted to get a tattoo!
34519,I know. I have a friend who has both arms covered.
34520,That sounds so good
34521,Its nice to be alone sometimes
34522,Has he been sick?
34523,I hope he is okay. 
34524,Those are pretty nice trucks ;/
34525,What kind of business is it
34526,I might need to apply then!
34527,I love buffets. What kind of food did they have?
34528,It happens to the best of us. At least you were able to get more since it was a buffet.
34529,Happens to the best of us
34530,There are still some nice people left.
34531,That is the best way to feel during an interview. Im sure you did a good job.
34532,Ill keep my fingers crossed for you.
34533,That sounds so fun
34534,Wow! How traumatizing! Were you scared at that time? 
34535,"Oh man, I think your mother regretted that after knowing she almost hurt her family. That is quite awful to think about."
34536,That's cool.  What was the last thing they did for you
34537,Wow that's pretty aweseome...you must have put in a lot of hard work to earn it
34538,"I suppose that is true to an extent, that makes sense"
34539,congratulations. sounds like you aced it
34540,"i bet you will make a great bartender, maybe one of these days you will hook me up with a free drink"
34541,That's terrible!  I can't imagine how hard that is.
34542,That's very sweet of you.  She's going to need her friends to help her through this!
34543,That is awesome! How much did you win?
34544,That is absolutely amazing! Lucky you
34545,Aw I'm sorry to hear that. I bet you have a lot of good memories.
34546,I remember my dad watching football so much as a kid. I used to get so bored.
34547,Did it hurt though
34548,"I am sorry, I would cuss too if it happened to me"
34549,Aw that's cute. Father-son/Father-daughter bonding moments are something I miss out on.
34550,"It sounds like you and your father got along well, and that isn't always the case in families. I'm happy to hear that."
34551,"That is so scary. I don't know what I would have done,"
34552,You did the right thing. I wouldn't have been able to stop thinking about it.
34553,"That must be a wonderful feeling, now you are on your own."
34554,"Ah, so you are now a loner, you should try to make friends."
34555, yeah I got to a few places like that
34556,Oh awesome! What are the tickets for?
34557,That will be fun.
34558,Oh that sounds dramatic. How did it turn out?
34559,I'm glad you worked it out!
34560,"A new job can be a little nerve wracking. Did it get better, once you settled in?"
34561,That's great. It sound like it's really working out for you. 
34562,I wish I was that lucky! I always lose.
34563,That is worse. I would have been so jealous and annoyed.
34564,That sucks. Did you have a hard time with it?
34565,Maybe you can get a tutor this time.
34566,You could always start saving now
34567,You can if you want
34568,That is great!  Are you really excited?
34569,I hope your date goes well!  Stay optimistic and positive!
34570,Awesome! you are extremely lucky. Will you be bringing anyone with you.
34571,"Duh! You better, I do hope you have a whale of a time. I would be elated."
34572,Wow that is a predicament 
34573,That was probably a good idea
34574,Oh my gosh! That is so funny. Was he really embarrassed?
34575,I can understand that. But its still really funny. My husband is the one to get more embarrassed over things like that.
34576,Awww! Sounds like you're a great parent!
34577,I hope I can be a mom someday!
34578,Well I hope it works out for you!
34579,I am glad you met someone.
34580,Everyone needs close friends to talk to and hangout with.
34581,Did they knock and leave?
34582,You should put a camera there. You can see it from your phone.
34583,Are you excited or dreading it?
34584,Good for you. I hope you get a good start.
34585,"awesome, whens' the first date?"
34586,"Aweomse, always great to see people forming new relationships."
34587,Ouch! Did you trip over a cord?
34588,Oh yeah? I'm guessing you're not a big fan of roller coasters?
34589,"Aww I'm sorry you didn't like it. Roller coasters can be pretty scary, even for people like me who enjoy them."
34590,That's great!  Did you win it on a table game or at a machine?
34591,Did you stop playing after that or did you try to win more?
34592,I understand.  I play every now and again and I usually quit while I'm ahead.  It always ends up that I'm waiting on my friends to lose all their money so we can go home!
34593,"Yeah - the first time I went with friends, I won 100 bucks but ended up giving it back to the casino.  I told myself that if I won money like that again, I'd just stop and take the money home.  It works out well!"
34594,Does he do that often that is not ok
34595,Yeah that is really not ok
34596,Oh wow. I have never done that
34597,Well that is great. I think people get upset over other people actions when it comes to facebook.
34598,What kind of puppy did you get?
34599,Those are \big right?
34600,Accidents happen. Are you feeling better.
34601,I heard that was going around.
34602,Yikes.  I'm sorry to hear.  Will there be other chances available for promotion?
34603,"I'd be pretty upset, too.  Did anyone give a reason why your coworker was chosen over you?"
34604,What is dove season?
34605,Oh!  I didn't know people hunted them!  What is used to hunt them?  Shotguns?
34606,You sound confident. What subject is the class? 
34607,Awesome. I'm sure you'll do well then.
34608,That is so nice you must be really looking forward to that. Will you be traveling alone?
34609,Make sure you take lots of pictures and prepare for the weather.
34610,You must have been really scare!  Could you sleep after that?
34611,"I imagine,  I am easily scared with these kind of movies, so I don't watch them much."
34612,That's cool what's your favorite part about it
34613,"Nice, you're never too old to go trick or treating haha"
34614,Were you competing?
34615,Thats too bad. What do you do now?
34616,How did you like it?
34617,"Great!  A new look can certainly help feel refreshed, at leas it does it for me."
34618,Are you planning to attend?
34619,You are a loyal friend. I do hope your friend will learn from his mistakes.
34620,"Yes, i have that one friend and you don't want to give up on him. I hope he gets it together soon"
34621,That's cool. What kind of benefits
34622,That's great. Do they offer dental and vision
34623,"Bahamas is a nice Caribbean island, you must be really looking forward to it."
34624,"I can just imagine, make sure you take lots of pictures and dress for the weather. It will be hot. "
34625,That was so nice of him!
34626,You are lucky to have a nice dad.
34627,what did you end up doing?
34628,"Oh, well I hope it works out well for you!"
34629,I'm so sorry to hear that. Death is never easy to deal with.
34630,I hope all your family was doing well.
34631,How odd. Sounds like a scam.
34632,Did you look into the situation further? Did you call your phone company and see what they had to say about it?
34633,That's a good thing. A lot of people (like me!) hate/hated it. She'll do so much better if she's happy.
34634,How old is she? Is she studying something she can use later in life?
34635,"Oh, well goodness, encourage her! The sooner she starts learning to love to learn the more joy she'll get out of it!"
34636,"No, it certainly isn't! Hopefully, she'll keep loving it and will love learning for the rest of her life. Think what a gift that must be!"
34637,"That's a good idea. It's best to be prepared for a dangerous weather situation, as you never know when it can happen."
34638,"Yes, as a wife and mother, I know I usually look to my husband for guidance and strength in situations like that!"
34639,"I feel sure as well, you are clearly determined and intentional."
34640,"That's the beauty of it, I feel motivated now so I need to keep an eye out on my local job market."
34641,"Pro's and Con's.  Those systems are abuse prone but, some people need them."
34642,"It can be infuriating.  For example, over a 3 year period in my own state, there was about ~20 million dollars worth of food stamps spent in major vacation hot spots (florida, hawaii, california, virgin islands)"
34643,Why didn't you go
34644,Or it could be you and a dope house party
34645,That should be an awesome feeling. I do wish you all the best in life.
34646,"You're welcome! you have your whole life ahead of you, you are a star."
34647,How come? What do your brothers do to annoy you?
34648,I hope they don't do it on purpose to annoy you!
34649,That is terrible. Did the police find them?
34650,I hate that people do things like that.
34651,I love eating at casino's. They have some of the best food.
34652,Did you win anything?
34653,Yeah it happens my little bro drives me crazy sometimes
34654,Same here how old is your little bro?
34655,"Wow I am so sorry to hear that, my grandmother passed from cancer about 10 years ago"
34656,"I get that, I will pray for her, best of luck friend"
34657,That is nice. You must have a nice body and I am glad that you feel better about yourself.
34658,"True, if one is not happy about something the best thing is to switch things up."
34659,Sorry to hear that RIP
34660,Do you have any other pets
34661,That is awesome! What all do you have going on?
34662,"That is great, you are very lucky and blessed!"
34663,"Wow, what are you going to do?"
34664,I would maybe hit him or get revenge at least
34665,Was she upset!
34666,What will you get her?
34667,What sport is that?  Sorry but I don't know anything about it.
34668,"Ok, sorry I didn't know.  I hope the play better next time!"
34669,Oh my gosh. I am not surprised they denied any wrong doing. I think that is typical of mechanics. What do you plan to do about it?
34670,I think bad reviews are important though. A lot of people use those to determine where they go for service. You may save someone else the trouble you have.
34671,That sounds great!  Have you not seen them in a while?
34672,It will be good to catch up with them!  Family is all that matters.
34673,I'm looking forward to it too! I remember playing Smash on the N64. I loved it.
34674,Sweet. I hope to meet you on the battlefield someday!
34675,You sound excited? do you do it up big?
34676,What are you going to do this year?
34677,That's an interesting theme.  Are you going to make the costumes your self?
34678,That sounds like lots of fun!  
34679,What do you hunt?
34680,I didnt even know there was a dove season. I actually never even went camping before
34681,I want to some day.
34682,"that is good, I am glad you can trust him like that!"
34683,"That is awesome, I am glad you have that type of relationship!"
34684,"Wow, that is great!  You must have been very excited and grateful!"
34685,I hope you enjoy your card very much!
34686,Congratulations! It always warms my heart to hear about a happy loyal companionship.
34687,"Well, it has been for three years so that's a great sign!"
34688,I can't say I'm a huge fan of fried chicken. Did you enjoy it at least?
34689,Ew that's gross! Can't you get sick from partially cooked chicken?
34690,"Oh wow, that must have been lovely. How was it living in paradise?"
34691,"Well I hope for you that one day you can. Maybe retirement! Man, that would be amazing."
34692,I could not agree more with you. but it seems like a lot of politicians either don't care or are not putting enough resources into combating climate change.
34693,"If all people do is pray, then certainly nothing will change. It's time to start acting instead of wishing for things to change if we want to our children and grandchildren to see a future."
34694,Aww that is sweet are you going?
34695,Aww well do what you think is best
34696,Well I would go on the date then buy the kid a big present.
34697,Awww. I remember that feeling with my first kid
34698,"it is. just wait until he says ""dada"" you will melt lol"
34699,What movie do you plan to watch?
34700,"Oh I've seen that, it is not too bad! I had fun watching it."
34701,I used to love them. I cant believe that are still performing
34702,I thought they were so much better that nsync too lol
34703,"i hate when someone does that, it can be so annoying :)"
34704,"no need to go that far, just make sure your friend has not seen the movie before and go out and enjoy it."
34705,"that is true, that is lame though"
34706,Its always good to have solid family members.  Not everyone has that.
34707,That's good to hear.  
34708,I bet you hate having to leave and I am sure she misses you.
34709,You must be proud of her. That is great.
34710,She must have a lot of faith in you.
34711,Ouch! I hope he was okay!
34712,Are your not liking your new job?
34713,That's no good. What are you going to do?
34714,"I am sorry you are feeling lonely.   Why don't you see your friends much anymore, are you all to busy>"
34715,"Yes I know what you mean,  That has happened to me too."
34716,Wow what kind of toys did you find
34717,THe nostalgia must have been so good!
34718,Nice! Would you like to send the cleaning fairy round to my place?!
34719,What a wonderful daughter you have. She has a very good heart. You've obviously been an excellent parent!
34720,Definitely both of you :) Maybe go to an ice cream parlor or a spa?
34721,Or even do both! Is your daughter in school?
34722,"Oh wow, that must be exciting! Is this your first home?"
34723,"I hope you do, too. I will definitely throw in a prayer or two that you do!"
34724,Does it still work?
34725,Nice. I love finding old stuff from my childhood.
34726,That's pretty rude.  Are you going to buy him some more beer.
34727,Man.. I'm glad you're not my roommate.
34728,Wow did anyone see?
34729,"Dang, it must have been embarrassing "
34730,You are exactly like me. Those were the good old days
34731,My youngests are 3 and 4 now. Those days are gone
34732,"That sounds exciting!, are you nervous?"
34733,"That is true,  but you will meet new people and learn a lot!"
34734,Congratulations!! How did it feel when you found out?
34735,"How cool! Congrats again on your new addition, I'll keep you in my thoughts and pray you get some sleep in the next 12 months haha"
34736,That is great news!  You must be really proud of him!
34737,That is good positive reinforcement!  Congrats to your kid!
34738,"Okay, I am sorry that it was not up to your standard. I have not seen it as yet."
34739,"Okay, I understand. I am thinking of watching it."
34740,Oh no. How long was the power out for?
34741,That sounds awful!
34742,How does that make you feel
34743,Well I wish you the best of luck.  If you're hardworking then you'll make it
34744,"Oh cool!  I bet it's also nice not having a boss breathing down your neck, right?"
34745,I have been in the past.  Right now I'm part time with some work at home/stuff.  So yeah I do remember liking not having a boss the most!
34746,"Well, that's a good present! I'm sure you are excited to get it."
34747,"That's right, you do. I have a hard time doing that myself and should realize I deserve it as well too."
34748,That sounds horrible!  Good thing you are all right and only walked away with a little shame!
34749,That's good.  It could have been a lot worse!
34750,I would be too haha...whos fault was it
34751,How old is your kid
34752,That's cool that you're active.  Does she go to college or what
34753,"Gotcha.  I make sure to call my mom at least twice a week, I'm 26 and I've got my own apartment as well"
34754,"That's really awesome, I'm happy for your success and encourage you to enjoy yourself."
34755,"So far so good, just trying to stay cool. Good conversations are helping."
34756,That is wonderful news. That is a lot of money to win. I am happy for you.
34757,"Oh yes, you can relax a bit and pay some bills."
34758,Amazing. Those things seem to never pay out. That is a lot.
34759,I know that feeling. Did you treat yourself after winning?
34760,I'm a Boston boy but I gotta give em props
34761,People hate on Brady cuz he's been gold since day 1.  But the Eagles came ready on defense that's for sure
34762,"That is good, that is what we hit the gym for right?"
34763,"I do, I have been trying to bulkup, I am 6'4 190 and need some more on my frame"
34764,That could be awkward. I wonder what made him feel he could do that?
34765,Hopefully he got the point and wont ask again.
34766,I am happy that you reached home safely. You have to be very careful when traveling at nights.
34767,"We are living in a cruel world, I am just happy that you are fine."
34768,"I know the feeling, my little nephew used to beat me at Mortal Kombat constantly just by button smashing. How did your little brother get so good at Wii?"
34769,Ahhh! Well at least you found out it was just user error and not that he was actually better than you!
34770,Nothing wrong with being emotional. It's healthy. I get a bit emotional about that stuff too. Family and friends are extremely important.
34771,"If they don't, that's their loss. My family are so important to me - I love them dearly. The same goes for my close friends. Don't listen to other people - they're the ones missing out!"
34772,He must trust you a lot.
34773,I hope you guys have fun
34774,That is nice. we are suppose to trust our spouses.
34775,I know one has to earn trust.
34776,"That is a lot of kids, imagine raising that many kids!"
34777,"wow, that is huge, they must have abosrbed kids from another duck or something"
34778,I am so very sorry for your loss.  I lost my mom last year.
34779,"It is a very long process, but it is true that time does help a tiny bit."
34780,OH no. Were you still at subway?
34781,I know the feeling. Its hard to work when you are hungry.
34782,I bet you were embarassed
34783,What happened? You had too many bills to pay.
34784,Haha. well at least you treated yourself now you are broke.
34785,Yes you will be looking cute and get a lot of attention
34786,Now you're talking. That would be nice ;)
34787,What is wake-board. That sounds a bit scary.
34788," I bet it is, i am afraid of water, I cannot swim so i know for a fact I would not be trying that. I hope you have fun."
34789,That no good!  How long will he be gone?
34790,Just hold on a little longer!  You will feel better when he gets back!
34791,That's great. Hopefully they eat a lot of food!
34792,I am sure they will have a great time
34793,You must be very proud of yourself. I am proud of you. You are a star.
34794,So you really surprised yourself. I guess you studied hard.
34795,Sometimes it just takes a time and you need to stay proactive. I know it can be disappointing. 
34796,Just keep a budget and stay strict. It will gradually get better.
34797,I think I have seen that movie
34798,I like animated movies. I have lots of kids lol
34799,Do you miss your family
34800,Nice I'm in TX and my fam's in MN.  I try to visit them at least once a year
34801,Oh how exciting! How did she do?
34802,"Amazing, you must feel really proud!"
34803,Congrats! How exciting!
34804,Good luck! I am sure it will be fine.
34805,"Ohh man, I am so sorry.  I have had that happen to me many times over the last five years.  Did you contact your landlord?"
34806,It is wonderful that you have family that can help.  Are you going to be OK going forward?
34807,That was really nice of you!  You must have a really caring heart!
34808,That cat will love you forever!
34809,I have never been on a roller coaster. I would be very scared too.
34810,"Hahaha you are going to scream, I hope you dont puke. It should be fun though."
34811,Awww that is so sweet. Did he go to a good home?
34812,That is good to hear. I hope he lives a good life.
34813,How are you feeling about it?  Are you sad?
34814,"I am sorry about it, did she move close by or to another town?"
34815,I bet you will be balling. I hope you remember the poorer folks like me.
34816,That sounds grand :) it's a deal I am rooting for you.
34817,And what movie did you guys see
34818,Wow that must have been a while back...do you still keep in touch with these friends
34819,Good luck! I am sure that it will go well.
34820,I hope you find out soon.
34821,Oh my gosh.  I am so sorry.  What happened?
34822,Oh no.  Poor thing!  Hope you are hanging in there.
34823,"That is good, reading always relaxes me too."
34824,"Yes, curling up in bed with those things can relax you like nothing else!"
34825,That is exciting!   How long will it take before they give you and answer?
34826,I hope everything goes great and you get your new home!
34827,"Ah a Patriots fan. Sorry about that, but they've been so great in the past, you should feel pride in that."
34828,"He really is a talented player, I must admit."
34829,How was that experience for you
34830,You must have been proud.  But she wouldn't be there if you didn't persistently push her to do her best
34831,I am glad to hear that. It can take a lot for some people to be confident like that. I am glad you got over your issues with it.
34832,"Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. "
34833,I've had that happen before.  Its like they are trying to become professionals at it. Was it a whopper?
34834,I think they would lie sooner if they could.  My kid told me flat out that her brother did something when it was impossible that he could've so I knew instantly.  Its humorous while they're young watching them get into such a deep hole.
34835,Are you going to have a surprise party?
34836,"I know that is hard, but it's alright if you do it for the right reasons.  You all will be able to laugh about it when it's all over.  Have fun!"
34837,"Oh geez, I know how that is. How long do you think it had been that way?"
34838,"That's pretty interesting. Well, I hope you get that all sorted out!"
34839,"Wow, good for you finding the courage to overcome your fear! I can understand why you were nervous after what you went through."
34840,I completely understand. Your parents sound like great people.
34841,That is great.  Do you still swim?
34842,"Well you can start slowly, I'm sure you will find your motivation again"
34843,That is so exciting! I love babies. Do you know what his name will be?
34844,Thats a neat way to decide on a name. We picked our kids names months in advance. Luckily their names fit them well. 
34845,Soooo how was it?
34846,Oh no haha. I'm guessing you at least had to be polite and pretend like you didn't want to puke?
34847,"Crazy, was it like the movies?"
34848,Reminds me of that Eddie Murphy movie!
34849,Lmao sounds like a confident dude
34850,Or he's looking for his soulmate
34851,"I hear you.  I still love the McNuggets, but I never eat them since I went Vegan."
34852,"It's the best,  but it is hard to give up the delicious fried meats, though.  "
34853,Oh my goodness!  What happened?!
34854,I bet you and your date were shaken up!
34855,Did you crash!?
34856,I am so sorry that happened to you! 
34857,"That stinks.  I always feel left out when that happens to me.  Even more so when I know the people from my best friend's work so when I can't be involved, its hard.  How do you feel about it?"
34858,"I'm sorry.  Make sure to reach out to her and tell her how you feel.  If she's a good friend, she'll understand and make an effort to make time for you but don't let it make you bitter."
34859,How terrifying!  Did the intruder took anything or was he just some kind of creep?
34860,That is so awful.  I imagine you won't feel safe again until you get the alarm.  You can also get a big dog to help you keep safe.
34861,"Oh man, that would have freaked me out what did you do?"
34862,It seems your daughter may over exaggerate things a little bit.
34863,Why did you do it?  Do you now feel bad about it?
34864,Well maybe you can tell your friend and ask him/her to forgive you.
34865,"Well if you trained as hard as you stated, I am sure you will do great!"
34866,Sounds like a great plan. Good luck!
34867,That's whats up!
34868,Keep it up. Failure is for dweebs.
34869,"Ouch, that sounds so painful!  No I have never have them.  Do you know you can avoid them in the future?"
34870,That is great that your wife took such great care of you!   I hope you are now feeling completely recovered.
34871,"Oh, really?  Was something wrong?  "
34872,I can understand your feelings; but I suspect you made the right decision.  Maybe it is something you can talk with your friend about.  A good friend will understand.
34873,Oh no! Did you find out who?
34874,"You should look for camera in the area, they could help you catch the perp."
34875,What are you getting certified for?  It seem that you were weel prepared.
34876,That is great.  I wish you the best of luck!
34877,That's cool.  Was he better than Cris Angel
34878,What kind of tricks did he do
34879,Congratulations! It takes a lot of courage to move away from home like that.
34880,It's great that you're so positive about life.
34881,Oh you are such a great wife! I think he will totally appreciate it! Are you doing anything nice for him?
34882,"Oh, sounds very romantic! Have fun my friend!"
34883,Oh no. Are you scared at all?
34884,"Well if you do decide to go through with it, I wish you the best and quick healing!"
34885,"Oh my, what did you have surgery for?"
34886,That's really nice! I hope you recover really quick!
34887,Great! I'm sure you've prepared a lot for it. Good luck!
34888,I'm sure you'll do well.
34889,Oh how exciting! I love the beach! Are you bringing lots of snacks and drinks?
34890,Oh yes don't forget the sun block. Very important! Well I hope you all have fun out there! I am jealous!
34891,They must have tasted good!
34892,"Lesson learned, that's for sure"
34893,Guess you're just going to have to evacuate or something!
34894,Better not go on any planes!
34895,Oh no! I hate when things like that happen. You can sometimes still get it if you try to speak to the manager
34896,"Yea...sometimes gym managers tend not to be there which is a pain. I hope it works out for you, though!"
34897,You must feel awful about it!  What are you going to do?  Are you telling your friend?
34898,Yes I believe it is better.  I hope your friend understand.
34899,That sounds sad.  What are you getting distracted from?
34900,"Well, that sounds admirable.  Focusing on making money so you can be independent.  "
34901,Try me
34902,haha oh man did the owner get mad...or did he just laugh it off
34903,That is awesome. What changed?
34904,Can fat really turn into muscles? Asking for myself? lol 
34905,"I rented a Corolla once.  It had great responsiveness, was speeding like a mofo "
34906,I'm more of a Honda guy tbh.  My Civic lasted me a 21hr nonstop drive from MN to South TX and she still runs good as new
34907,Gross!  That must have been disgusting!
34908,That is true!  way to look at the bright side!
34909,How scary!   Thank god nothing bad happened after all. 
34910,"That is the important thing,  I always keep reminding myself to focus while driving too."
34911,"True, you must be feeling nostalgic, kids going back to school and all"
34912,Someone needs to invent a time machine!
34913,that is awesome. i too have had the same issues.
34914,i wouldn't eat until 11 am and then stop eating by 9pm
34915,it's not as hard as i thought it would be. certainly helps with staying within a certain amount of calories per daay.
34916,"Aww, why's that? Do you live in an older home>?"
34917,"Hey, don't worry about what other people think! As long as you have a safe roof over your head and your family is happy, that's all that matters!"
34918,Oh no.  Did they do damage or steal anything?
34919,That is definitely scary.  I don't understand why people want to steal from others.  Get a dang job!
34920,Was that for work?
34921,I'm sure you are going to do great.  I really hope you do get a better paying job as a result.  Good luck!
34922,Oh that sucks! How far do you live from the venue?
34923,Sorry you missed the concert. That is a bummer! But it came with some perks I guess. You met a girl!
34924,What a nice story and how wonderful to feel so protected!
34925,Yes I am sure that have make you or will make you in the future a wonderful parent too!
34926,Oh no! I hope that you get well soon and that the tests come back okay!
34927,"Me too! I'm not sure what you might be going through but do consider making sure youre eating a good amount of fruits and veggies. Herbs too, they're all healing and helpful to the body."
34928,"Good to hear, coffee is the bomb!"
34929,"So much winning, but with coffee it never gets old"
34930,Did she forgive you?
34931,That must've been funny
34932,"Jeeze, I hope he really had to go, otherwise he must have been slacking off on purpose!"
34933,"Well that's good, at least he didn't do it on purpose. Otherwise I would have found a way to get back at him. Maybe laxatives to make him REALLY go!"
34934,"Oh, congratulations! That's awesome. When's the wedding?"
34935,I can imagine. Now you have to get planning the wedding. Should be fun
34936,"That was very careless of him, I'm sorry."
34937,Maybe you should talk with him and let him know how serious of an issue it is to you.
34938,"Sorry to hear that, I'm glad you were prepared."
34939,You did the right thing. You should always stay ready for a disaster.
34940,"Cool, what did you study?"
34941,"Nice, I bet you can't wait to graduate."
34942,"Those are such high payments, be sure to get your plan based on your income, it really helps."
34943,"Yes, the US takes advantage of the need for education. I hope you find a job you love, and don't forget that they have lots of payment options."
34944,Oh that sounds mean.  How did you do?
34945,Are you two still going out?
34946,"Well, that was terrible of you. Why would you do that?"
34947,Wow.... I certainly hope so.
34948,"Ouch, I've done that before. But how sweet of him, sounds like a keeper."
34949,"Ah, so he had ulterior motives and wanted the chores done! Just kidding. Glad you're feeling better."
34950,Oh no! Did they help you find another home/let you stay with them for a while?
34951,That is so great! Its good to know that there are still good people in this world
34952,I love those. That must have brought up some nice memories.
34953,Oh I see. Are you far from home?
34954,Congrats! Did he choose wisely?
34955,"Well, you did say it was one you really wanted. How nice of him to do that for you."
34956,"Oh, that must be heartbreaking for you. Do you know where he is?"
34957,That would be the best birthday present ever! I know he'll make every effort possible to be with you.
34958,I am so sorry to hear that. That kind of news is always hard to receive.
34959,They have all kinds of treatments for cancer now. He should have a fighting chance.
34960,Sorry to hear that. What happened to him?
34961,Oh that is a nice surprise. I bet you caught up with each other.
34962,"Jeez, wonder why they left it there for that long?"
34963,"Who knows, that's a waste of a good sandwich though!"
34964,That must make you angry. Can you report him?
34965,I understand. Hopefully he fixes it for you.
34966,No way!! Are you ok?
34967,Did they take anything valuable?
34968,Every found out why they didn't show up?
34969,Well that's understandable. Hope you had a great party afterwards!
34970,That must be amazing! I wish I had your job
34971,It would make me feel amazing to see their face!
34972,Oh that is cool! I bet you are proud.
34973,It is paying off. That is such a fun age.
34974,Oh no. That sounds annoying. Know what's causing it?
34975,Hopefully you have insurance?
34976,That's unfortunate. A hit and run is terrible
34977,I hope things look better. My friend dealt with a similar issue
34978,That's unfortuante. I bet he is good now
34979,What university or college?
34980,Oh how exciting! Are you at all worried how they'll take being separated?
34981,Definitely. It will probably be tougher on you than him. Here's to a wonderful first day of preschool for both of you!
34982,I am so sorry. That is horrible. Now what?
34983,That must be so difficult. I hope all turns out well.
34984,Awesome. That is a huge accomplishment.
34985,You must be very proud. Cant wait to see what he does next.
34986,Wow! That is amazing
34987,I have never had that happen to me
34988,That's disgusting! Hopefully you got a refund or your food recooked?
34989,"Good, I bet you were mad. At least they made it right though."
34990,Well hopefully you will see them again soon. I'm sure they will.
34991,You must find joy in your life - something you are passionate about
34992,You must be anxious and excited! Was it expected?
34993,Hope everything goes as planned!
34994,That is so sad. Did you find out who did it?
34995,I feel so sorry for you. I love my pets too.
34996,How exciting! What kind of car is it?
34997,Oh sounds nice. Hopefully he doesn't have any accidents in it.
34998,Where will the show be?
34999,that sounds amazing! check out the french quarter while you are there.
35000,"I love the weather that time of the year. I agree, it is so much fun."
35001,That is awesome. I love all the food and time off.
35002,You sound like a great uncle!  You must be proud of him!
35003,That is great that you are there to help him out!
35004,i hate to ask why you walked back out
35005,"gross, i don't blame you, public restrooms are always disgusting"
35006,Ooh fun! Has it been long since the last time you saw them?
35007,That will be nice to have some time to catch up. Have fun!
35008,"Yes, I love big trips. I spend hours packing!"
35009,That's debatable!
35010,That's awesome! Congratulations.
35011,That's great. You have quite the household it seems!
35012,That's unfortunate. Sometimes used cars can be tough to deal with
35013,I hope not. I have a feeling things will get better
35014,"Oh no! I have had that happen to me before, too."
35015,"Good, I would have too!"
35016,I'm sure you'll do great! Have you been preparing?
35017,Good luck! don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park!
35018,Congratulations!  That's awful!  DO they not have kids themselves?  Its a pretty typical thing to happen when you're the first to have a baby among them and they don't understand that lifestyle. I've been there.
35019,"I'm so sorry. My sister was in the very same situation as you and I can tell you, she made it through and her daughter is 9 now.  She kept taking a day at a time and working hard and went back to school to become a nurse. You can do it to. Find some true friends who will support you no matter what. "
35020,"I am so sorry to hear this. I am sure you will find another job, but it doesn't make it any less painful."
35021,"Just have faith, I am sure it will all turn out!"
35022,That's sounds like a lovely night. I bet it was wonderful
35023,"I love the guitar, too! That's marvelous"
35024,Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear that.
35025,How old was your friend?
35026,"Wow,  you are so caring"
35027,"Ohhh,  so how is she now? "
35028,That's exciting! I wish you the best of luck!
35029,"It's already yours, hopefully! If not, that means there's something out there better for you.:)"
35030,I'm so sorry! You must've been so sad. Did you find out who did it?
35031,Oh thank goodness! I hate hearing people losing their pets.
35032,That's awesome. Where to?
35033,I hope you have a splendid time! That might be great
35034,That is bittersweet! What is his name?
35035,"That is a unique name, I have 3 sons myself."
35036,"I would have been scared, too! Was it by fault or was someone attempting to break in?"
35037,"Mine did that, too. We had to replace the motion sensor."
35038,thats great! what is llws?
35039,that's great! my kids played baseball
35040,How exciting! What is it?
35041,Omg! That really is the best birthday present ever!
35042,That must have been really exciting.  Did you think you had lost it?
35043,Were you really close to her?
35044,"That's unfortunate. You will get the next one, I am sure."
35045,I bet your employer still knows how much you have put in
35046,That sounds fun! Has it been a while since you seen your family?
35047,I am glad you are getting to see them!
35048,Are you a nurse?
35049,That is awesome! My sister is a CNA now but in school to become a nurse. Have you worked in any other settings as a nurse?
35050,"A new mom? Good question, maybe offer to mow their lawn? I don't really know haha"
35051,"Welcome, and yeah I always disliked mowing the lawn!"
35052,I'm glad. You seem very happy
35053,I'm glad you have a great family!
35054,Ah that is depressing! What state?
35055,Wow that is a long move!
35056,I bet it gets lonely
35057,Yes there are. Can't trust anyone these days.
35058,What is so great?
35059,Around town? or what?
35060,Was his name Joe Dirt?
35061,I think I heard about them in the news.
35062,I'm so sorry. I recently just lost both of my grandparents within a year. I know how you feel.
35063,It really is. Getting older is not fun.
35064,Oh my gosh! Me too. It literally makes my skin crawl. 
35065,I agree. I avoid going to stores during busy times because I just cant handle being around so many people.
35066,Oh no! Spaghetti sauce is so tough to get out
35067,Lol i am sorry about that! hopefully you can get it out
35068,Me too. It is a huge pet peeve of mine.
35069,Right? Get out of the way!
35070,Was you way down yonder on the Chattahoochee?
35071,Hmmm... Not as interesting
35072,Oh man I HATE waiting on test results! Gets my anxiety to extreme levels.
35073,Well I'm glad to hear you have a clean bill of health!
35074,Life is not fair for anybody
35075,"Yeah, as long as you have a car you are better than most people"
35076,Sheesh that is terrible. I would have a hard time not leaving
35077,Well hopefully something else will come up for you!
35078,"That sure do, how old is your son?"
35079,That is so exciting.. enjoy this time with him.
35080,I love eating out at a restaurant with great food! Too bad it's too expensive to go every night!
35081,"Yeah, I enjoy cooking but it can be so time consuming."
35082,"I would have shot back, that is uncalled for"
35083,Maybe you should cut his brakes
35084,That sounds really cool.  Is her Blog very popular?
35085,Oh my goodness!  That is so awesome.  I would love to be able to do something like that.
35086,Thats one of my biggest regrets was not investing in it. Now the value has skyrocketed. 
35087,I didnt know that. I guess not.
35088,that is bad how did it happen 
35089,what happened afterwards 
35090,What did he do
35091,Oh my! That is horrible!
35092,Oh wow! I guess he didn't care!
35093,"That is the truth, no shame in his game."
35094,Interesting... what are you going for?
35095,"That is awesome, good luck"
35096,"I do, too! I always make my husband kill them."
35097,I don't blame you! Get them all!
35098,That is awesome. I hope he says yes!
35099,Well I wish both of you years of happiness together!
35100,Probably didn't last too long when you got back though I'm guessing
35101,"It happens, I'm sure they don't blame you!"
35102,Does that mean what I think it means?  have you had a juicy flatulence experience? 
35103,I wonder if there is anything you can do about that.
35104,"Oh my that is horrible, i hope you find it!"
35105,Man there are some crappy people in the world
35106,Did they get caught?
35107,Did they take anything important?
35108,What were the leftovers?
35109,I enjoy fried rice! I hope she wasn't too upset.
35110,"Nice, what did you do with it?"
35111,Haha yeah I guess you can't really return it at that point
35112,Any big plans? My son just turned 4. I've been nostalgic also.
35113,That sounds fun! have you been looking at the old baby pictures?
35114,That is a very nice thing to do! I am a big animal lover. 
35115,Me either. It breaks my heart. 
35116,t
35117,I am so glad to hearit. What's going right in your life?
35118,"Oh no, was you able to get pregnant?"
35119,Congrats! Are you still pregnant?
35120,What band? That was very thoughtful or her. 
35121,"Awesome, I hope you have a great time at the concert. "
35122,Do you think you have a good shot?
35123,Is the interview soon? Good luck.
35124,"Wow, where did he get it from?"
35125,"That's awesome, glad he's able to hand it down to the next generation"
35126,Oh man that is so scary. Did they steal anything?
35127,Were you in the house?
35128,That is awesome! I am happy for you!
35129,That is what is most important!
35130,"That's funny, it's like you can see your kids and see yourself experiencing it when you were a kid"
35131,"Right, it's hard to imagine there was a time before you when you're little"
35132,That sounds nice! I'm sure they appreciate it a lot.
35133,I bet! Good bonding time. How old is your son?
35134,Wow how exciting! what do you do?
35135,If you put forth the effort im sure you will
35136,"I'm sorry. Your boss still knows about the great work you have put in, though"
35137,Yes you will! That's a great attitude
35138,Wow that's actually hilarious. And very unfortunate
35139,Wow that's even funnier... But even more unfortunate
35140,"Oh, no. Was it deadly?"
35141,That is rough. I am glad you made it through.
35142,Are you nervous? I'm sure you'll do great if you prepared.
35143,Good luck! I'm sure you'll ace it!
35144,I find myself not finishing potatoes either! They take so long to cook
35145,"Right, taste good too"
35146,I could only dream of having that. That must be nice.
35147,I wish my company would allow me to do that.
35148,"That is faithful, you are a good dude"
35149,"That is good, they are hard to find"
35150,"Oh, no! Were you alone?"
35151,She must be a party animal.
35152,"Fluff that stinks, did you shoot em?"
35153,sheesh what a bummer!
35154,"I do not like scary! I try to stay away from scary movies, too!"
35155,It sounds like you had a good time though.
35156,How fast were you going?
35157,"Wow, I got a ticket the other day going 70 in a 55. I was late for work"
35158,"Nice, hope you have fun!!"
35159,I'm sure it'll go swimmingly
35160,Who is your team.
35161,That is good. what is going on with it?
35162,"That is good, i hope it stays that way"
35163,Ive been wanting a jeep for myself too! They are so cool
35164,I agree! They look cool and are fun to play in the mud with
35165,"Nice, must have been shopping with his wife."
35166,Macho man lol 
35167,"That's funny, likes it's an extension as who they are as a person"
35168,"I see, yeah sometimes you just gotta lead by example"
35169,"Man that was super lucky, most people would have taken it"
35170,"Exactly, it doesnt happen very often "
35171,Really? I dont watch much football
35172,I like soccer
35173,that was very nice of them. you werent able to walk into an office and get it faster
35174,oh then that makes sense. good thing they were willing to help
35175,Wow. Twins. How rare is it to have them?
35176,Man. Thats very interesting. Were you at all surprised to have twins then?
35177,"I've never tried that, do you bet money on it?"
35178,"Nice, hope it goes well"
35179,"Slammed as in he got really drunk, or slammed as in he got into a fight?"
35180,Its been a while since I've seen someone drunk
35181,"that is strange, i would have got out of there"
35182,I would be a little spooked out by being alone
35183,"That stinks, did you go anyway?"
35184,"Yeah they are, but so good"
35185,"That is awesome.  Is it with the same company, or someone different?"
35186,I hope you get it!  When will you find out?
35187,"Cool, what did you do about it?"
35188,"Little bugger, maybe next time"
35189,Which movie did you see?
35190,I watched parts of it too. I didnt think it was that great either.
35191,what is co-op?
35192,Oh that is really neat! i hope they like it
35193,Did you do or say anything?
35194,Sometimes you got to setp in and say something though when you know something is not right.
35195,Were you legit sick?
35196,"Lol that happens to the best of us, dont feel bad"
35197,Wow that is impressive. Do you work with him?
35198,That is still not bad!
35199,Nice!  Hope something horrible didn't happen to you just to get it.  You getting a lot?
35200,Wow!  That seems worth it!!!!  Wish it had happened to me! ha ha.  Hope you're healthy still and congratulations!
35201,That is awesome! What breed?
35202,Oh ok that is very nice of you 
35203,That's pretty scary.  Was it like a scene from taken?
35204,That sounds pretty awful. no thanks.
35205,"Oh, that is irritating sometime! That happens to me sometimes"
35206,"Lol. I am guilty of hiding a couple of snacks for myself at times, nothing wrong with that"
35207,How did that go? 
35208,No way! I can not stand when people do shady things like that. We you able to get your stuff back? Did he get in trouble?
35209,Yeah I would have been mad too. If he needed something he should have at least asked. Stealing is never okay.
35210,"Wow that is odd, is there nothing you can do about it?"
35211,"That is insane, i hope everything works out!"
35212,That sounds like a win!  Did she get mad?
35213,This just happened?  Oh boy!  maybe you can replace it before she gets up.
35214,That's awesome. I hope you don't spend it all too quickly.
35215,Make sure the consultant doesn't try to rip you off either haha.
35216,"I hated chemistry in school, i hope you do well"
35217,It is a difficult subject no doubt
35218,"That's a good idea. Hopefully, you had enough room"
35219,That's good news. I bet it was fun!
35220,"Mmm, pizza sounds good. What's keeping you from ordering pizza yourself? Why let him have all the fun?"
35221,Go for it! You'll only regret the pizzas you don't eat!
35222,"Dang, traffic must be intense in your area"
35223,"True, driving takes more focus than a lot of people can handle"
35224,who's birthday is it?
35225,don't worry
35226,Do you feel bad about it?
35227,You should make it up to that person.
35228,Oh I do not like spiders either!  What did you do?
35229,I'd probably have done the exact same thing - then called for my husband or one of my daughters to kill it!!
35230,Oh no!  Were you able to take care of him with medicine or treatments?
35231,I'm so sorry!  I know how hard it is to lose a pet!  I hope you are not sad for too long.  It sounds like you did everything you could to give it a great life. 
35232,"That's good to hear, one of the best advantages you can have in life"
35233,And they're all you got in the end!
35234,"Whoa, did you find out what it was?"
35235,"I dont blame you, i would have been terrified "
35236,It can be boring to drink at the bar by yourself.
35237,That must be a cool bar to let pets in.
35238,"I have a problem getting rid of things too. Sometimes you just have to throw it away, or donate it."
35239,Just leave the house and have someone trash it for you.
35240,Glad I could help.
35241,Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that. Were you close with this coworker?
35242,Than I completely understand that would be so hard
35243,That would even make it worse. Did it happen all of a sudden?
35244,I am so sorry for the loss. Good friends are so hard to come by
35245,"Nice, it's like little kids can learn anything!"
35246,"That's awesome, hope he goes far"
35247,Oh gosh! are you ok?
35248,Haha thats a good name. Were you able to see it vividly?
35249,Ouch what a jerk. Why did he do that?
35250,Oh I hope you punched him back.
35251,Oh no! Was you at least at home when that happened?
35252,I bet that was embarrassing. Was you drunk?
35253,"Im so sorry, i can not immagine that"
35254,"I can agree with that, adulting sucks"
35255,i miss them as well
35256,"Oh they're in your bubble. that stinks, some people are weird like that, no bounderies."
35257,"I truly do feel bad that you have to endure that. My girlfriend and I were just talking about how horrible she's going to feel when she loses her Havanese pup at some point in the distant future, since she's so close to her. I hope you can grieve the loss of your great friend in a healthy way."
35258,"I can appreciate why they'd say that. They just want you to feel better. But it's all about to how you're feeling. You'll know in your gut when to get another pet, if you ever want to get another one. It's important to take the time to reflect on your lost relationship."
35259,"That's wonderful! You're right, it is so rewarding to stand back and see everything clean once you are done."
35260,"Right, that's something you can at least have full control over. Your own humble abode."
35261,"Was your landlord truly trying their best, or did they simply not care about your well-being at that time?"
35262,I'm so sorry to hear that. Some people are just cruel to others that are not within their social circle.
35263,ugh. People like that are gross.
35264,I know right. Some people are too lazy.
35265,Wow I envy you. That sounds like a wonderful feeling!
35266,Thank you! I hope to feel that content someday!
35267,I didn't think that was possible for a dog on a walk! What kind of dog do you have?
35268,That's quite the mix! What's his name?
35269,"Funny you say that... my roommate just got a cat about a month ago. I was hesitant to agree to share the apartment with it, as I'm not the most fond of them. But I didn't want to say no. It's actually been an affectionate cat so far."
35270,"I suppose so. I've never gravitated towards them. They seem like they only have one personality, and they're either nice or mean, and never warm up to you over time. So, I was a little wary of that."
35271,What kind of hobby do you have?
35272,That is awesome!  What kind of boats do you make?
35273,That sounds like an ugly scene...did anybody step in
35274,For real? haha good job!
35275,That is awesome! i am happy for you!
35276,"i agree totally, it takes a strong person to admit they are like that"
35277,What kind of trouble is he having right now?
35278,Oh no. That is no good! It is hard to sit back and watch someone have a drug problem
35279,Good job. That can be really tough to go through that.
35280,You are a good friend though. I wish i had more friends like you.
35281,"They'll understand, sometimes it's better not to overextend yourself"
35282,Better to rest so you can do everything you want tomorrow!
35283,"Yes, I love it here. It is the greatest country in the world."
35284,That is how I feel about it. I love my country.
35285,"Dear lord, how old are you?"
35286,I was joking. I havent a curfew since I was 17. Im an only child so wouldnt know much about favorites.
35287,O no did you report it to the hospital
35288,That is not ok I would make go to a higher up
35289,You want to start school back up?  What are you going for?
35290,I bet that is a lot of work!  Do you already teach?
35291,Oh yes! I know your feeling. I see my dog as a child as well.
35292,Right! It's like some kind of spiritual bond I think. It's a wonderful love to have!
35293,"That's touching, how is it these days?"
35294,"Right, change is often difficuly"
35295,Yeah I see no harm in that
35296,Yeah i know i dont get why people are that way
35297,That would be great. Good luck.
35298,I really hope you get it. Just stay confident.
35299,Congratulations! I'm so happy to hear that. You must be really excited!
35300,Holy moly ravioli. 27 million? You are rolling in the money.
35301,"that isnt good, were they true?"
35302,"That is terrible, is there someone above him you can go to?"
35303,Are you going to watch?
35304,"No, I am not a big fan. Which team do you like?"
35305,How did he get hurt?
35306,That happened to me a few weeks ago. I was severely dehydrated and I fainted. I hit the ground hard.
35307,I am now. Had to get stitched up.
35308,Oh dang. Do you think it was intentional?
35309,Oh that stinks. I bet you were pretty mad?
35310,"Oh no, what did you buy?"
35311,Was it at least Budweiser?
35312,Sorry to hear that. Do you think it was an intruder or just some prankster? 
35313,Did they take your television? 
35314,"What stops you from going? Being busy with life, or just deep down you just do not want to go"
35315,Sometimes life does have away with getting away from us
35316,Life is good when its like that
35317,Cherish those moments
35318,"I don't blame you, I would have eaten some. Did they notice?"
35319,What type of candy was it? I like Sour Patch and chocolates.
35320,Good taste in candy! I love Reeses cups and Hershey bars. Did you eat any of those?
35321,What the heck is there?
35322,School can be al ot of work
35323,I say go for it
35324,I'm sure she'll be flattered if you're honest about how you're feeling!
35325,"I see, I hope it goes well for you!"
35326,what do you mean i think it is pretty good right now
35327,Yeah it always foes in the end
35328,"That is terrible, i hope everything is ok"
35329,That's got to be annoying! Have you tried telling him to stop?
35330,Maybe he should take up knitting--or something else that would be a bit more quiet.
35331,Ah that is disgusting!
35332,"Same here. Are you living on a street where it is normal, as far as crime?"
35333,Dang that is pretty scary though.
35334,"Yeah, when I was younger I did some of that stuff as well. It's a really embarrassing thing to hear stories about things you did that you don't remember doing."
35335,"Well if you have never gotten blind drunk and strip naked, you haven't lived."
35336,Oooh like what kind of toys?
35337,Wow that sounds like fun.I love canoeing!
35338,You ever think about moving?
35339,Hope everything works out for you!
35340,"Aww, how long have you been together?"
35341,"That's amazing, keep up the good work!"
35342,Why did you steal stuff?
35343,"Oh, that is rude, did you pay him back?"
35344,Nice! I wish I was more active in searching for scholarships like it sounds like you are. But this one sounds like it was a lot of hard work to earn. I haven't been the smartest about lightening the student loan debt burden while in school. Good on you for looking ahead.
35345,"Sometimes compromises have to be made. But I have to say, I'm impressed that you were that self-aware about the entire process, especially as a somewhat new adult. Good for you for considering all the options and making the choice you felt was best. You sound like you'll be successful after college, especially because of how hard-working you are."
35346,Nothing like a deep clean to breathe new life into your home! Its a great idea to get it out of the way now so it won't me on your mind once things start to get busy. 
35347,I completely understand that. Its a good quality to have and is actually healthier in the long run if you keep your surroundings clean.
35348,Someone broke in?
35349,Good thinking.  Sounds like you should get yourself a new house
35350,"I agree, such helicopter parents exercise far too much control on their kids, doing more harm than good in the long run."
35351,I completely agree. Unfortunately we also have to clean up the mess made by our parent generation.. you know like climate change exists! 
35352,What kind of belt does he have?
35353,Heh. Thats really cool. I need to take self defense classes.
35354,Oh man i am jealous. Are you going with anyone?
35355,Dang are you scared at all? As far as doing it yourself?
35356,Did you tell him he ate it in his sleep
35357,I hope it tasted good!
35358,Why are you having to go again?
35359,Probably from the crazy weather change. I hope they figure out what is causing the cough
35360,Oh no. Well I hope that makes him better
35361,I am sure he will be fine
35362,I am happy for you. Just keep going
35363,That is a good thing ha
35364,"That's great.  I don't have any tattoos myself, but a lot of people I know do.  And it seems expensive.  So I'm glad he's not charging you much. "
35365,It seems that a decent one is several hundred dollars.  I just don't have that kind of money.
35366,"I hope so, too. Heart conditions can be scary! Do you have anyone closer to her that could check in?"
35367,I know quite a few people that live their lives that way. I can see some of the reasons why a person would think that -- but it's still difficult when it comes to the health of someone you love.
35368,What is deserved or undeserved? 
35369,"I see, dont worry though. Nowadays everyone finds an excuse to grab their pitchfork and point it at someone.   "
35370,That's good timing at least. Glad it didn't take too long.
35371,What ended up being the problem ?
35372,She sounds like a great girl. I am sure it will you sound like a happy couple.
35373,"Hell yea you sound like a genuine guy/girl. You know what is important, you will do fine."
35374,Why would your uncle be upset? And how do you feel about the situation? It sounds like there's a lot to unpack there.
35375,"I see. Well, what's most important is your reaction and feelings around the situation, and what you plan to do about it. The only one that can affect the outcome is you. It's disappointing to deal with your uncle's negativity, but you can't let it distract you from moving in a positive direction."
35376,That's great when life just feels right
35377,I hope they do too! I'm happy for you
35378,"You must be feeling nostalgic, maybe your kids will enjoy them"
35379,"Right, it's amazing how one thing can bring back so many memories"
35380,"Wow, that was super nice of him. You are lucky to have such a great dad."
35381,That is a really great thing to hear. I hope you can find some way to pay back his kindness.
35382,yeah but that is his ob
35383,yeah im not sure i could every take that job
35384,"That sounds like an uncomfortable situation. What ended up happening? I kind of avoid large crowds and sports events because of this, since there's usually alcohol involved."
35385,"Oh, so you got involved? Were you trying to protect the kid? If so, I can understand that, and that's noble. Hopefully nothing too negative came from the situation."
35386,"Yikes, that's very disrespectful. I hope you told him how you feel about that."
35387,"That's good, at least he learned from that. I hope you guys are going strong now!"
35388,Did your boyfriend notice?
35389,Lol. Sometimes we got to do what we gotta do
35390,Did he! You lucky dog!
35391,"Well dang that is awesome man, hopefully you can save up for your own lambo."
35392,Were you actually under the influence?
35393,"Well that's great of her, we've all done stuff."
35394,"That sucks, I'm sorry to hear it. Did they at least ask you first?"
35395,"At least they asked you, that's good. It will pass in no time and you'll be hanging soon I'm sure,"
35396,"Dang, I guess she wasn't your friend after all"
35397,"It is, glad you could figure out that she's not right to have in your life"
35398,"Oh no, did you get into trouble with your boss?"
35399,"Ahh, that's too bad. Just make sure to take responsibility and be very sorry for your actions, maybe it won't be so bad."
35400,"I get that, nothing can beat home!"
35401,"I am sorry to hear that, well maybe when you retire!"
35402,A good dentist is great to have!
35403,Did you have a lot of work done?
35404,what were the left overs?
35405,That sounds good!
35406,Sounds like quite the adventure you had. You must feel proud of yourself. 
35407,Yes and hopefully no one was hurt. 
35408,Nice you must feel pretty lucky
35409,Haha I wouldn't either if I had a Porsche....sounds like you need some kind of bomb shelter emergency parking
35410,Are you happy with it
35411,I am glad for you then
35412,A couch! how was it hurting you?
35413,Haha no worries. I though how could a couch could be scary... Are you OK? did you go to the doctor?
35414,"Oh, no! It happens to the best of us."
35415,"Luckily it is in the past, and I am sure no one remembers it!"
35416,That's good to hear! What makes him so awesome?
35417,I'm happy he's able to support his family through his work. I hope he enjoys it!
35418,Gross!  I would have been super mad if my cat did that!  What did you do?
35419,"Yeah, I would have done the some.  Hopefully that never happens to you again."
35420,"Oh no, maybe try going to reddit and ask people what to do in your city!"
35421,"Hahaha, me too, it's such a time sink. This week when it was down for a couple hours I really felt like I had nothing else to browse."
35422,Uh oh! How was it driving weird?
35423,Yikes! My old Ford Focus had a similar issue. It turned out to be really bad alignment and ended up putting a hole in our front tire. 
35424,Oh yeah?  You applying to a new job?  
35425,Oh how cool!  Well good luck my friend!!! What do you want to study?
35426,What does it not do right?
35427,"That's so lame, you should maybe tell your boss about it though."
35428,"Oh wow, that isn't good.  Hopefully you had good insurance and that you are ok!"
35429,Is the kid ok?  He won't have his license for a few more years probably now.
35430,So exciting! Do you have any special gift in mind for them? 
35431,"Thats alright. As long as you two are happy with each other, thats the most important thing!"
35432,I hope you don't feel jealous of your friend. Did he accept the job?
35433,Seems like you have a trustworthy friend for life! I hope you cherish this friendship.
35434,Don't you just hate that?!
35435,"Just remember, it is probably a female mosquito.  They are the ones interested in your blood.  Not the males.  "
35436,Sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends?
35437,Good job for realizing that because such people are a bad influence. Join some outdoor or interest clubs and you might just find new friends. 
35438,Yea i would be too! That is a horrible person.
35439,Aww i'm sorry. Maybe enjoy a glass of wine and watch some girly shows. My husband is in the military and gone a lot so I feel for you.
35440,"Aww thank you, means a lot! "
35441,"I think if it's done without care then yes, care for what she would feel that is. Maybe you just have to tell the truth about what you're feeling, but it's up to you!"
35442,"Right, but deep down I'm sure you know that you don't need a relationship to feel content!"
35443,That was very nice of him. 
35444,"Wow, that is a wonderful keepsake from him. I bet you really cherish it."
35445,That's nice. Was it a special occasion or anything ?
35446,What did you have to eat ?
35447,What kind of memories
35448,Those were good years for sure
35449,"Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! loss can be hard :("
35450,I'm sorry! Take the time to grieve and be there for your friend.
35451,Congrats! that sounds like a good movie!
35452,"I saw it, and it was a good  movie, i dont usually watch marvel films"
35453,Sorry to hear that. You must be going through a tough time. 
35454,"You should try engaging in a hobby to divert your mind, and when you're ready, adopt a puppy from your local shelter. "
35455,"Hey, congratulations. That must have been a lot of hard work. I wish I put more time into extracurricular stuff like that. It's a good look in the future. Especially the debate team--you develop so many good life skills with that!"
35456,I bet... that's a lot of weekends and late evenings practicing and honing your skills. I'm sure it's a lot of positive intangibles developed that you will reap the awards from later on in life.
35457,"Glad to hear it! Health is such an important thing, and the more you look after your body, the better it will treat you. "
35458,"I agree, now you will financially and physically secure. All the stress of not having insurance is far too much given our healthcare costs."
35459,Uh oh! Are you going to ask him to pay for it? Or at least fix it?
35460,"Might be time to just stop letting him use your stuff, unfortunately."
35461,That is strange. Did you like the gift?
35462,That is for sure! Someone must really like you!
35463,"Oh my, sorry to hear that. How is he holding up?"
35464,I am sure it is. Just need to give him time and support right now. 
35465,What are those? Your grades?
35466,Math was always my least favorite. Are you British?
35467,Did you find out why he was fleeing the draft?
35468,That's a bit much of him to dodge his country when they needed him don't you think?
35469,That is awesome! I bet you are so proud
35470,That should motivate him to keep up the good work!
35471,Were you playing in a team?
35472,"I'm glad you're taking it seriously, parents have the ability to be the best thing that ever happened to their kids' lives, or the worst, but I'm sure you're doing your best"
35473,Hope you're enjoying it!
35474,That's great! What percentage are you thinking you'll be getting?
35475,That's really good then. I'm sure it will help you financially
35476,How'd it end up after the fact ?
35477,I hope it all went well for you.
35478,"That's always fun, to see those random memories crop up when you least expect. What kind of board games were they?"
35479,"I've played Monopoly before, of course. I wonder why that's the game everyone's played during their childhood... But yeah, Risk I've never played, dunno why. Maybe you should grab one and get some friends or family involved, for old time's sake."
35480,That is funny i feel like someone should have said something though
35481,That is great well know you know what not to do on a plane lol
35482,How long have you had it?
35483,Is this recent. Do you know why?
35484,Wow that's lucky.
35485,oh i cot ya. i am glad you have your stuff.
35486,Which Six Flags did you go to?
35487,I live right by that one!
35488,"Nice, such relics of the past really hit you with a wave of nostalgia. Did the gear still fit you?"
35489,"Oh I see, that is to be expected. At least you still have the gear!"
35490,"Oh nice, how did it go?"
35491,Thats great! Glad it worked out for you and your dog was safe! I hear so many bad stories about people loosing pets.
35492,Haha I bet it wasn't that bad....was it
35493,OK now I'm curious...what the hell did you do
35494,You must feel so content at this point. It must have taken a lot of hard work to get to this point!
35495,I am glad that it is finally paying off! Keep it up because independence is the sweetest thing. 
35496,"That is unfortunate, is it possible to go through chemotherapy again?"
35497,I hope everything works out for you 
35498,That is so sad. Dogs become part of the family so when something like that happens it is like losing a family member
35499,"I am so sorry for your loss, within time you will heal. Just try to cherish the memories that you was left with, Think about all the good times"
35500,"Yeah, I have a doughter as well and understand.  I guess kids will be kids!"
35501,The things they do make no sense.  Kid logic!
35502,"Uh oh, do you think you were being rowdy?"
35503,It's Ok. Everyone can chang ein life. Do you drink too much?
35504,"Oh my, sounds like you have the dreaded roommate situation on your hands. Have you tried talking to him? "
35505,"I see, if you're in college, try talking to your Resident Advisor about it. "
35506,That will be nice. Are you going to have some free time?
35507,You could get a nice dinner with that. Have fun.
35508,Is the car terribly damaged?
35509,I hope it will be ok. Were you late for your work?
35510,"That sucks, it takes so long for them to arrive!"
35511,"I feel that, even though I prefer Winter"
35512,"I get that, but all seasons are good, you miss the ones that it is not"
35513,Is that a game ?
35514,"No, I'm sure I'm a bit older than you."
35515,you can train and get better
35516,i thin yyouca you just have to believe in yursef
35517,"I get that, too bad we cannot refund movies"
35518,Nice! You must be so proud of him to achieve such a milestone! 
35519,He must be for his children to seem him as an inspiration! 
35520,Oh god! Is everyone you care about OK?
35521,"Man, i am so sorry, i could not imagine."
35522,Do you find value in them still?
35523,I think you should keep them instead of throwing them away.
35524,How did he get it?
35525,I hope it wasn't too painful for him and he disinfected and bandaged that wound up.
35526,Oh my god! Are you ok? was anyone home? Did they take anything important?
35527,That's weird. I am happy you have your possesions.
35528,Who is it? 
35529,I bet she is! I am so glad you get to see her. Mom's are awesome!
35530,Was the fire set by someone or an accident?
35531,"That's horrible, i am sorry!"
35532,That is good.  It is nice to focus on the positives
35533,I am glad to hear that.  I hope it keeps staying that way
35534,Ugh teenagers can be so troublesome some times! I hope you made him realize what he did was wrong. 
35535,"Yup, but what I don't like about that age is having to stay up all night!"
35536,Helping animals sometimes brings great pleasure. You did a good deed
35537,Awe. Ya it doesn't take much to get attached to something that you are nursing back to health
35538,That sounds like a cool place to go! Can you bring your cat there?
35539,That is so cool! We adopted a cat from a shelter and he is the best cat!
35540,Nice! You must be so proud! How old is he?
35541,What an angel! I'm looking forward to starting my own family too.
35542,Ewww. Adults should know better than that. I think I would have been grossed out
35543,That's wonderful! I bet it was a nice trip down memory lane.
35544,Memories are the most precious thing we can have in life I think.
35545,Wow that's been a long time. Did you two have a good time together?
35546,That's great that you two reconnected like it! I'm happy for you.
35547,It is ok. Most spider are not dangerous. What is it a big one?
35548,What did your friends do?
35549,On no. Was this at a public place?
35550,"Oh no, when can you take it again?"
35551,Dang that is unfortunate!
35552,Hey that's great!  How long has it been?
35553,Dang.  I bet you're gonna have some good times together!
35554,Whats going to happen?
35555,"Oh gosh, i think it was just a tree falling i bet."
35556,Oh I hope you get it! It can really help out or just be a splurge 
35557,"Definitely, it's good to work for a company that does that too"
35558,"a 'B'? Hmm, well you know how it is, hope your stomach feels better!"
35559,"You'll be fine, next time just look and see how clean their bathrooms are, it gives you a good idea how their kitchens are!"
35560,That's wonderful. I also love the holidays. It's the perfect time for families.
35561,Sounds like heaven! I am also looking forward to them too.
35562,That's awesome. You must be so proud of him.
35563,The LSAT is no joke. He must have studied very hard.
35564,What kind of cupcake do you like from there?
35565,"Those are so tasty, are you excited?"
35566,Awesome! I hope you do well! When do you take it?
35567,"You will do great, just stay confident!"
35568,"Communication is key, have you talked to him about it?"
35569,"Age doesn't amtter, show him you are ready."
35570,"Oh no, next time you should bring a friend to be safe."
35571,"It's okay, you got out fine this time!"
35572,What does he normally talk about?
35573,"Oh yeah, that really is a waste of time"
35574,Nice!  Did you have a good time?
35575,Thats good.  Stay confident and let things happen naturally!
35576,Gratz. What's the secret?
35577,"Good to hear, glad you guys are happy!"
35578,Was he drinking heavy? I'm sorry hope the night wasn't too bad.
35579,I'm sorry to hear that! haha guess he's not invited next time!
35580,Don't be! You are awesome the way you are!
35581,"Our imperfections help us stay unique! Do worry yourself with that, there are so many other things that can get us down and worry us! Just keep being awesome!"
35582,Hey... congratulations to you on both fronts! That sounds like double good news. It was probably fun having your hard work rewarded with seeing the faces of all your loved ones and having them personally congratulate you.
35583,"Well, it's good to have you join the workforce in society. You seem like a positive person who can contribute well. Hopefully you find a passion that utilizes your hard-earned degree."
35584,"Ahh, is he a troublemaker right now? Most of the time, it's the friends they hang out with. Young people are easily influenced by the people around them."
35585,"Yes, he needs a firm hand to lead the way out of this kind of behaviours. You need to step up and introduce some strict schedules so he won't have time to do anything bad. "
35586,"Yeah, gotta be careful one day you might hurt yourself pretty bad"
35587,"Nice, what year?"
35588,"Dang, that must look great!"
35589,im sorry to hearyou were homeles
35590,That is great congrat!
35591,Interesting...you sure it wasn't fish that washed up on the shore
35592,Gotcha..hope that didn't ruin your whole day
35593,"Why, what happened to make you feel that"
35594,"Nice, I never understood why that's embarassing haha"
35595,Oh wow that sucks! Hope it wasn't too embarassing!
35596,"Oh wow I'm sorry! That's not cool, they would be hurt if people were laughing at them"
35597,That's great! Where are they working?
35598,That's got to be frustrating. Have you thought of maybe working at the same place?
35599,That is scary! Hope you did not find yourself in the bad part of town
35600,That is horrible! I bet a little part of you was scared
35601,Oh wow! That is intense! I am glad he didn't get kicked out!
35602,It sounds like it!
35603,That is amazing. Sounds like you have a really good support system.
35604,I have a few. It really does help when times are not so great.
35605,That is pretty neat especially if it gives you good memories!
35606,Now you can carry on that tradition.
35607,I do too. I wish we could have fall weather longer.
35608,Same here and next thing you know it's a blizzard.
35609,Oh what happened instead? Did your friends throw you a party?
35610,Wow! What a great surprise! You should thank the person that planned it!
35611,That is awesome! I cannot wait until my student loans are paid off!
35612,I am happy for you! 
35613,"Oh, don't be! Just have faith in yourself and be confident that you can make it in. "
35614,"I see, think of it as having a conversation with a friend. It will make it easier! "
35615,They do have nice bags! I hope you are able to get one!
35616,"They are, but if you save up a little at a time, it won't be that bad!"
35617,Nice! How are you celebrating for him?
35618,So cute! Take a lot of photos so he'll be able to see them in the future!
35619,"Yum! Sushi is so good, I'm sure you'll enjoy it! I like the eel roll and spicy tuna roll."
35620,I'm sure you will! Maybe start with a simple roll like the california roll or ask the waitress for recomendations. 
35621,Where are you going? I would say if your gut is telling you that it is not good then I would suggest listening to it
35622,Lol. Oh. Coasters are fun. Very exciting!
35623,"A ""really nice"" piece of hair?  Yikes.  Did you send it back?"
35624,Well good.  Hopefully you got your food re-made though.  
35625,"Oh dang, that is too bad.  Can you guys video call?"
35626,"Oh OK, hopefully you have some friends you can bring over and share your traditions."
35627,I'm right there with you. I've always been a home-body. I don't like going out as much. Sometimes people say millennials and technology have disconnected people too much.. that could be true. But at least we're comfortable doin it.
35628,"Absolutely. I'm the kind of person that can be around for people a little bit, but get drained by them. I think that's getting more and more common for others. Could you tell me what kind of animals you have real quick!"
35629,"That is awesome, I was an early reader as well! That is a great accomplishment!!"
35630,I hope they both keep the love for reading and writing!
35631,Oh no! I'm so sorry!  Are you able to be up for another one soon?
35632,Oh great! That's sooner than in my company.  I know you'll get one. Just keep working hard and good luck!
35633,It happens to the best of us! I know the lady understands!
35634,Maybe you'll never see her again! 
35635,"Sorry to hear that, I know that you probably feel disappointed but there will be other opportunities! "
35636,"Yes, and you will succeed eventually. "
35637,Do you have some uncertainty in you life right now?
35638,That is really tough.  Are you in a career now?
35639,Do you have any opportunity for an internship of some sort?  The career advisers from your school may be able to help.
35640,"I did that myself, and I can tell you it was well worth it.  I am much happier now than I ever was.  I wish you very good luck on whatever you decide to do!"
35641,As in living alone or single?
35642,Oh no. Thats terrible. 
35643,"Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! Put your leg up and relax this weekend! "
35644,I hope your insurance does too! Just take care of youself and I hope you feel better soon!
35645,"That sounds really frustrating to deal with. You sound like you're self-aware and anticipating the problem, though. Perhaps you've already started preparing to look elsewhere?"
35646,"Well, luckily Google is so helpful these days. There's tons of templates out there. It's kind of annoying to deal with, especially because it's being motivated by your company possibly disappearing.. but it won't take long at all to craft a good one, especially because oftentimes the shorter they are, the better"
35647,Nice. Did you find a good hairdresser?
35648,"I am sorry to hear that! My dog is a part of the family, so I understand. I hope everything is okay."
35649,"It is scary to think about, I hope for the best!"
35650,that is a cool job
35651,Sounds like a great trip. I hope you guys have a fun time.
35652,That is exciting. When is she due?
35653,Yes it is! Is she having a boy or a girl?
35654,Awww! Congratulations! I hope everything goes smoothly.
35655,"I totally understand.  Life can sometimes seem overwhelming.  I have learned to stop, take a deep breath, and do one thing at a time."
35656,"It's just a way to calm the body and the mind.  It is SO easy to fall into the trap of anxiety.  But falling there doesn't accomplish a thing.  Take a breath, focus on one small success, then move to the next.  "
35657,Yikes! Bet the car payment is not worth it. lol
35658,"Sometimes jealousy can become us. But most times it does not pay to be that way, cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right"
35659,"Woah, hope she doesn't report you! Jk"
35660,"I see, hope she is able to understand!"
35661,What are you applying for?
35662,"That sounds interesting, when do you learn if you got in?"
35663,What game and what kind of award>
35664,Way to go! That is a great accomplishment!
35665,Oh wow that is so exciting! I'm sure you are excited to move in.
35666,"Aww that's great! I have two dogs, they become part of the family! Enjoy your new house :)"
35667,You sound very content. What makes you happy?
35668,Well that is a good reason. You are blessed.
35669,"Oh no, I would have had a heart attack."
35670,Sell the house!
35671,"Nice, how was it?"
35672,Hope you're all right!
35673,Are you doing the cheesecake for your family?
35674,That's really nice! You should show her you appreciate her. Maybe cook her dinner!
35675,"Ahh yes, that's very nice too, good for her! You guys have a happy marriage."
35676,Ugh that must so inconvenient and uncomfortable! 
35677,"I can relate, I get red face when ever I have to come infront of the class to present. "
35678,"Oh gosh, is he going to take you to the Superbowl at least?"
35679,"Just one ticket, that sounds lonely for him."
35680,Nice! I want to take my daughter when she is older. Did you go to Disneyland or world?
35681,California is fun to visit as well! Glad you all had fun.
35682,aww that is great!
35683,yeah my mom did that for me a few years back
35684,Oh naughty. Did anyone see you?
35685,Well it's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of the universe! I am sure it will be fine.
35686,Are you making a trip to see your family?
35687,Great. It is always good to see your family. Is it very far?
35688,That would definitely be a difficult thing to find out. How did you find out?
35689,Wow. That is really horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you. 
35690,"Haha.. I feel like that's almost a rite of passage when going to water parks. I've had that happen, too. Hopefully it wasn't too traumatic for you. I almost lost my glasses once, too! Now that was really scary"
35691,"That's the spirit. It's good that you don't take yourself too seriously. Heck, my roommate walked in on me doing some ""self-pleasure"" just yesterday.. I used to think that was my worst nightmare, but in the moment I just did my best to laugh it off so we could move forward faster"
35692,I hate when that happens! The same thing happened to me when I moved out of my apartment. They kept my security deposit because they needed to replace carpet.
35693,"Mine hadn't been replaced in 6 years, I found that out after the fact. "
35694,"That's pretty awesome, congrats"
35695,"Confidence is key, it's honestly what upper management looks for not necessarily technical skills right off the bat...just like Leo DiCaprio in ""Catch Me if You Can"" haha"
35696,Good on you. You need to be comfortable in your own skin and its not other people's business to tell you how to live. 
35697,"Yes, they should really learn to concentrate on their own life instead of complaining about other people."
35698,Did you get up to check it out?
35699,That would have scared me. At least it wasnt an intruder.
35700,that is exciting@
35701,yeah same but it can be fun
35702,That is an amazing talent to have. I would be so scared!
35703,"Me too, that would be terrible."
35704,I hope you did it. Don't worry too much.
35705,If you need to you can always take it again. Good luck!
35706,What happened? Hope you are okay?
35707,"Omg that is so scary, I am so sorry to hear that. "
35708,Did you find anything great?
35709,What a wonderful memory.  
35710,Oh hey that's awesome!  That is awesome right?
35711,That is awesome!!!! Congratulations!
35712,Did you suffer any injuries?
35713,Why did you feel guilty? People really shouldn't drive drunk.
35714,Yeah i wanted to tell you about the time i was hit by a drunk driver im so happy to still be alive after that experience
35715,Yeah he was punished hes in jail still
35716,sorry to hear! do you have any idea about the break up? did you think about it ?
35717,sorry again! hope you'll get relief from this sadness. Please concentrate on your interests to divert your mind from this.
35718,Which Concert?
35719,"Wow, that's awesome! I have never been to an actual concert."
35720,"Ugh, those articles always get me too... :( What was wrong with her? "
35721,Jeez! Its so unfortunate... very sad really. 
35722,That is nice of you. What did you do?
35723,Which one?
35724,"He will, I have faith."
35725,No problem. What kind of work does he do?
35726,Thats not good. Do you own a gun?
35727,That is always number one goal.
35728,3 years is a long time. How come?
35729,"Oh I see. They must miss you, too."
35730,Yes. I do not have a Facebook.
35731,Thats horrible.
35732,Yes I do not like walmart.
35733,Thats horrible. Did you tell on him?
35734,Thats a tough situation.
35735,"I guess it makes you appreciate things you used to take for granted, lol. But it doesn't last forever and is worth it. "
35736,That's a full time job raising a human
35737,"Oh, I'm sure you are lonely. Maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?"
35738,"That's a good idea! This way you can also meet friends for yourself, but also maybe meet new friend's for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!"
35739,oh man. i'm all about discipline! I don't like spoiled bratty kids
35740,"yes, i've heard some parents don't ever say no to their kids. makes no sense"
35741,Did things end amicably? I hope everything is good now!
35742,"I understand that, I hope things work out well for you both in the end!"
35743,That is a very blessed day. It is something you will never forget.
35744,"Yes, I couldn't agree more. It is remarkable how your feeling suddenly change."
35745,I bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened.
35746,Oh I'm sure. I would not like to be in a situation like that. Good thing everything worked out for you.
35747,Oh really? What happened with your family and friend then?
35748,"Oh wow, that's awful. Stuff like that really teaches you to appreciate what you've got and to not take it for granted."
35749,"I agree, someimes we just know"
35750,"exactly, i get that entirely!"
35751,That's great! How did they surprise you?
35752,"That is so sweet of them, I hope you enjoyed it!"
35753,"Awww, That sucks man. Hopefully they don't say mean things to you about being lonely."
35754,Well i used to be lonely a lot but i eventually found someone. I think you will too.
35755,"Yeah that is always odd to me, before they can talk they are already unique!"
35756,"That is how it goes, sometimes you can just figure them out immediately"
35757,"I understand that one,they are my favorite place to eat"
35758,That has happened to me too many times to count
35759,That must have been and intense and emotional moment for you.
35760,"Uau, what a surreal moment.I always believe kids have a lot to teach us."
35761,I'm sure it will! I didn't get along with my dad until i became an adult.
35762,Yes it did. I believe she just waited it out and tried to neutralize the conversation when we were together. 
35763,Where you not secure in your self?
35764,"You can track her down to say sorry, or would that be creepy?"
35765,"Wow, so your going to take being a bad person to the grave. Maybe you'll see her in the next life?"
35766,Lucky you! That is rare. Maybe one day people will think of you like that?
35767,I have something totally different. My boss is clueless to the world and have no business being a leader. 
35768,Well I've been in the business all my life and have worked for some great people. So I pull from what I learned from them.
35769,It's crazy how quickly kiddos grow! Even in a few weeks time! Do you see your friend and her baby often?
35770,That is how life goes! Different schedules and demands -- I'm sure she's so thrilled when she *does* get to see you!
35771,"Wow, that is an amazing accomplishment!  Congratulations!  You gotta be feeling like you're on top of the world after that!"
35772,"My first thought was ""California"" but then there's Venice [Italy] and then either way, that's an amazing destination!"
35773,"Oh, wow.  Not only to be able to do all the running but to view the scenery!"
35774,I'm sorry to hear that! How did you find out? 
35775,"That's a real bummer, but as they say, there are plenty of fish in the sea!"
35776,I practice boxing. I love to punch the sandbags.It is very therapeutic.
35777,Oh no that is terrible!  How did your daughter take it?
35778,Oh poor thing.  I hope she is doing better now.  Losing a pet is extremely hard!
35779,"ooo they are gonna love it, just its expensive, I remember when it was only $20 to get in."
35780,Which one are you going to California or Florida ?
35781,Cool.  Somethings never change.  What did you reflect upon?
35782,"Yeah, I miss my dad.  He died several years ago.  What kind of car is he looking for?"
35783,I'm trying to get into it. we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything. Do you have tips? 
35784,My big thing is i'm like O' I may need that leave it out of the tote box. Before I know it I have more stuff laying around then when I started.
35785,"Well, sometimes people are busy and don't have the time to check emails"
35786,"Text and emails are still the best option., until a nw way is created."
35787,Isn't that what sisters are for?  What were you guys upset about?
35788,"Maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again, you can try to approach the topic from another angle."
35789,Congratulations! Where did you travel from and where did you end up?
35790,"That must have been quite the culture shock, glad it all worked out though!"
35791,"I know, that actually happens to me sometimes! Last year I didn't get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks I was underestimating myself a lot."
35792,"Yea for sure, I definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way. When's the last time you have been really disappointed? "
35793,I totally understand why he was mad. Why did you tell her?
35794,I guess he wanted to be available if she needed him.
35795,What is a back neighbor? And that is crazy!
35796,Oh my! I'm glad she apologized!
35797,I understand. I am think the same thing. What is your health issue?
35798,"Yes, we should try to yourself heathy"
35799,"Oh, it sure is, I feel the same way. They grow up so fast! "
35800,One of them is! I have an 18 year old and a 12 year old.
35801,I bet you were beautiful on that day. :) I hope that confidence has carried on since then!
35802,"It would be hard to replicate that day for sure, but I bet you have a lot to be confident about. You got this!"
35803,I bet it's tough. A regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better. 
35804,Your so lucky. Insurance is my number one worry every month. 
35805,Oh ya? What happened?? I'm intrigued
35806,Woah plot twist. She brought him along to meet you? 
35807,OH I love the beach!!  Which beach are you going to go to?
35808,"PCB is where we always go! If you want to drive a little bit, go to HUNTS in PCB - it's off the beaten path but THE best seafood and prices - just go early (like 4oclock) for dinner or you won't get in!!"
35809,Why didn't you go?
35810,Is she always a flake? Maybe time for a new friend?
35811,Did he do anything to you and your mom?
35812,I am glad that nothing happened.
35813,"No, you didn't tell me! What happened?"
35814,"Oh no! Is she okay?! Don't beat yourself up too much, you couldn't have ever imagined that she had been in an accident."
35815,I love Fireball.
35816,"No, what happened?"
35817,Thats horrible. Will they reschedule?
35818,"Who, tell me!"
35819,"Wow, what happened?"
35820,That is very nice gift. Did you bought anything for him for Father's day?
35821,Oh what job was the interview for?
35822,I think you got it man! Congratz!
35823,oh my  are you really serious?
35824,I am very glad it has a happy ending. Sounds a bit scary
35825,Did you ever tell your friend?  
35826,"Oh no, I hate when that happens. I can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice! Its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer"
35827,I wish refrigerators would have a warranty that replaced food when they went bad. 
35828,"Wao, you must fell weird about it! what you thinki to do about it?"
35829,"SUper tough situation, i think you should let her know, and let her decides next"
35830,"Oh, I'm sure you were embarrassed! But, maybe you can laugh about it now?"
35831,"Well, I'm sure mom had a laugh lol! I can imagine how you felt at the time though!"
35832,"Ah, that sounds fantastic! Which ocean will you be enjoying?"
35833,Sounds awesome! Do you have a beachside beverage or traditions that you enjoy? (Mine would be tequila + lime...very Jimmy Buffett ;-))
35834,"Well, that's impressive! I can see why you are proud. Sounds like a hard working young lady!"
35835,"Yes, I was the same way too! I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!"
35836,Absolutely I agree I always try to not even bring cart unless I have too many too carry.
35837,Yes me too Now if everyone would just take our lead lol
35838,oh wow. Do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet?
35839,First time parent?
35840,What kind of work do you do?
35841,"Actually I'm not, but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations, I would imagine it's also exciting and new every day."
35842,"I agree, its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas"
35843,Yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business
35844,"Baby belugas are cute, but not as cute as your baby!"
35845,That is so funny! I don't think she'll want to be compared to an ant when she gets older. You'll have to remind her.
35846,"That is great!!  Sometimes we mom's get a bit forgotten, so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling."
35847,"Those words are the things we cherish more than any other thing, I love it when my girls do that!"
35848,"I am not sure, it was pretty random"
35849,"No, nothing at all"
35850,I know
35851,That is exciting news!  I bet you were so surprised!
35852,Ha!  What a neat day to announce it - did they do any special kind of announcement?  I see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement.
35853,I do watch Netflix sometimes.  Do you watch?
35854,I haven't heard of that one.  What genre does it fall in?
35855,Sounds interesting!
35856,Did it go your way?
35857,That is great - have you found another job yet?
35858,"I hate traffic too, it makes me angry"
35859,People are so rude when they drive these days
35860,I can imagine! That was a terrifying movie.
35861,"That happened to me too.. with the other Exorcist movies and the Ring movies. Even though they scared me, I was too curious to not see the others."
35862,She sounds like a person with great ability. Great choice of friend.
35863,That's great. I wish I had someone so close like that!
35864,Is that a bad sign? Perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?
35865,"Oh, I see. I am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over-saturated."
35866,Put what word ? You mean published the info?
35867,So what breed did you get ?
35868,I would be too! You did what you had to do!
35869,Do you find the home buying experience worth it?
35870,How long do you plan on staying in that house?
35871,Well that's awesome! I'm happy for you!
35872,"You shouldn't, because that is  a very stressful job"
35873,And don't forget how many years they have to study in order to get a license for surgery
35874,Really? Do you know what you want to do when you graduate? I know sometimes it's tough to settle on a path.
35875,That sounds like a great career plan. You will be filling a very important role in the physician's practice!
35876,I'm not sure. What would you do?
35877,Maybe I will try that. Do you think it will work?
35878,"Oh no, that sounds like an awful situation. What did you end up doing after that?"
35879,So exciting! It can be fun to have a roommate
35880,"I love that. Lots of new friends, haha"
35881,I've heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot?
35882,Where I grew up didn't have one nearby so I get a little jealous hearing about it.
35883,Good lord you must have had Facebook for a LONG time! I started mine in college so there isn't anything from my younger years.
35884,Oh ok lol. I completely understand. I had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player. Totally remember doing that!
35885,I am 33 :)
35886,"Me too, bullies are part of the reason that I homeschooled."
35887,"Well, I was referring to my own kids. They have adjusted well at 17 and 19."
35888,I also saw it and felt like it was pretty good. Much better than the My Little Pony Movie. That was TORTURE.
35889,"Yeah it was so boring. Even my kids got bored and they had been dying to see it,"
35890,That's not nice of them. Why do they keep taking it??
35891,"Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts, so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like $5, $10) save it and be strict not to spend it."
35892,"LOL! This is perfect timing because I had the "" You are an adult not a child"" conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago. I had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky. I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed, then you have to deal with the consequences. "
35893,"Okay, it wasn't just one, it was three: One cherry, and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh, the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like, I don't care if yuo bought them for the kids, I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would, but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now, lol"
35894,Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. That would be incredibly hard. What happened?
35895,That's horrible. I'm really sorry about your friend. 
35896,That's a beautiful name! It's cool you honored your friend in that way. 
35897,I can't even imagine. I've never lost anyone super close to me yet...
35898,Did you not have a car? That's hard. I don't have one now and use Uber and Lyft all the time.
35899,That is incredible! I swear some things in life are determined by fate. I'm glad you were able to get a car.
35900,"It's incredible, and so important. That's why I try to pass on the kindness whenever I am able."
35901,Yes.My first was when i turned 18.
35902,LOL.You had to beg your husband for a surprise party??
35903,Did you have candles or a flash light to help yous see?
35904,Well atleast you have something to help you guys.
35905,That is great! My B.S. ( I always hate saying that because I have to say I have my BS in psychology) is in Psychology.
35906,Pet? Like dogs and other?
35907,"Wow, seriously I hate those pets being around me"
35908,From where?
35909,"Congrats ,that's a step forward"
35910,I am so sorry. I can't imagine what you must have went through.
35911,That must have been really hard. 
35912,Really?  What kind of work does he do?
35913,Wow.. that is impressive.  Are you guys still friends?  Maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores.
35914,Awww... reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that.  What was the necklace all about did you make it or something?
35915,Well why did you have it if it belonged to them?  Did you pawn it?
35916,Thats sweet of them. Maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash.
35917,All the time.  That is part of listening to music I suppose.  The songs remind you of when you first heard them.
35918,"I know what you mean.  However, the older I get the more I want to go back LOL."
35919,Oh no!  What happened to it?
35920,So sad!  I am sorry.  Don't feel too bad its natural for them to want to be outside.
35921,it is so sad to know but my mother is rather sick of flu and not dying 
35922,Oh yes but it is not as bad and you cannot call it dying like in Cancer patient 
35923,Did you get sick afterwards 
35924,i do not think sushi is that good too. The best option is to stop eating them in any form of food
35925,Damn that sounds like a pretty good one! How did that turn out?
35926,That's how all pranks should be!
35927,I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???
35928,Oh that's too bad. ): I don't want to overstep but I always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up. 
35929,"I think that's good! If you are meant to be together you'll feel it and it will work out I think, if you just keep your conviction and stick with it. Good luck with it! "
35930,"Aw, that's sweet! I really am hoping y'all make it through this together. (:"
35931,"So sad,you can never force someone to love you. You will find the right person for you."
35932,Don't give up on love.It the best feeling ever to experience. Wish you well.
35933,Do you have a good chance with her. Have you talked to her about it?
35934,That will be better. Talk to her before you lose her
35935,"Probably one where I got a limo with all my friends and went to this restaurant, it was great. What about yours, what makes your friends so great too?"
35936,"I wish my friends bought me alcohol, that would make for a hell of a night! "
35937,hi are you there?
35938,That must be hard I always wished I had a sister though I have a brother 
35939,Oh my! You must have been terrified! Did everything turn out ok?
35940,That is not good at all. That is a very scary situation.
35941,"I have not tried yet, but i feel like it would be enjoying and full of delight"
35942,"I live in a place where it only snows once in 10 years. So, i think i am passing on that"
35943,You are so lucky. Mums are the best. What do you do for her?
35944,You should spend time with her whilst you can. My mum died and I wish I had been with her more.
35945,"Nothing went wrong, we just have different lives in different places. I go visit every now and then."
35946,I did not revise. Sometimes exams are failed and things are not corrected.
35947,That is great that you have an awesome Mom!
35948,Yes I do love my mom very much.
35949,"ooh, am so sorry about that. Have you tried to talk to her?"
35950,that will help you know her stand on your relationship
35951,well i am a mover so i have to bring heavy furniture up and down stairs.
35952,it pays decent and feeds the kids so I can't complain.
35953,That's awesome. What are you majoring in?
35954,Sometimes it's good to have something you enjoy make money so you can pursue your passion without worrying about it.
35955,That is such a bummer. Why did you keep watching them?
35956,I understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing. Maybe you should stop watching as many though. 
35957,I like scary movies as well so I know how addicting they can be.
35958,"It is actually ""Scream."" "
35959,"Oh yeah, Donald Trump is such a charlatan. He has some really shady history too. I'm actually a Christian and a conservative but I'm appalled that everyone on the ""right"" have fallen for this guy. He's so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be."
35960,"Yeah, I am sad about the whole left vs. right thing in general. Ultimately we should all be uniting against the corrupt people that are running amok in the government. "
35961,awwww. congratulations. what is your major
35962,lovely. thats really great. wishing you all the best
35963,"That is interesting, how does he buy you stuff or is he just really nice?"
35964,I am happy for you wish I could find a nice lover like that.
35965,"Yes, I think they offer a great bridge to the past. Do you?"
35966,That's great. It sounds like a very good situation to be in.
35967,:( I'm very sorry. Have you tried telling her how you feel? That could affect her decision.
35968,"I know it's hard to build the confidence needed to do something like that, but you don't want to keep them to yourself. If you really think she is the woman of your dreams then you have to try"
35969,I'm not quite following. Anything you want to tell me about?
35970,Well did you have any story or anything that you had in mind that you wanted to tell me? I told you a story of mine before so you owe me haha.
35971,That is really nice of her.  It is nice to have someone to help you do things sometimes.
35972,Yes.  Too many people these days are mean to one another!
35973,"That's so sad, I hope you've gotten over it."
35974,"That's good, death is a natural part of life."
35975,"No,u don't have to be "
35976,"Yes,u will surely get over it"
35977,That is very special and I am so happy for you.
35978,"Yes, married for 15 years and it is still great."
35979,That's good to have a loving family.
35980,I am i love them very much. However we live on opposite parts of the country.
35981,"Wow, 7 years? You were really young then"
35982,But did you tell your friend about it later?
35983,Oh no! That must have been super embarrassing! How did you react to that?
35984,"My goodness, well I guess that happens to all of us at least once."
35985,"That sounds fun, starting a new life is always great!"
35986,"West Coast is fun, but it can be expensive."
35987,Because she was what?
35988,I think that is a good news for you both since you are not married
35989,I can imagine the loneliness someone can experience.
35990,Get your self a friend to stay with for a couple of months.
35991,"Wow, please make it real."
35992,"Wow, I belief u can make it."
35993,Who is supplying these snacks? 
35994,"Sounds like a cupboad cleaning is necessary. If they ain't around, they can't be eaten."
35995,why did she go visiting?
35996,really? so she would have travelled with him
35997,That sounds horrible. You must've been mad.
35998,Where was this?
35999,"Well,it can happen like that atimes"
36000,"Yes,it really hurts"
36001,am sorry to hear that. what happened to the mother
36002,"soryy, may she rest in peace, please try comfort your wife"
36003,"Damn, very confident huh? What job did you apply for?"
36004,"Oh wow, that outta pay very well."
36005,"Oh boy that is the worst, so frustrating! Has there been any change since?"
36006,Hahaha you put the hammer down good for you bro. How are things with the new wife going?
36007,You remember that show hahaha totally my twin. I'm glad for you bro. Good luck to you!
36008,Oh my god! How old is he?
36009,"You really need to let him know not to do that again, he could've really gotten himself and others hurt!"
36010,Really? What makes them A list?
36011,Yeah I have lol. What's your brothers name?
36012,"Not being able to fit into an old wedding dress, is one of a womans worst nightmare."
36013,"The dress was a few years old, I couldnt believe it didnt fit."
36014,I like Starbucks. But they're a little expensive for me to go there often.
36015,A latte.
36016,"Wao,thats great,congrats!"
36017,"Thats good to know,keep it up"
36018,"Wow, that will be so devastating for you"
36019,"So, how did you now do it"
36020,Report to their management
36021,Just give it a trial
36022,"Haha, how did she feel when she found out?"
36023,Oh no! Those cookies sure do sound delicious though.
36024,"Dang, I hated that. At least it's not cow poop, that's worst. "
36025,"Oh man, you gotta super clean it, have the professionals do it even "
36026,How do you make it?
36027,Good to know.  I will do it like it next time.
36028,Congrats! What gender did your child end up being?
36029,That's great my man! I can't wait for my first son. So far 6 daughters :(
36030,"don't panic, and don't be harsh on the kid. perhaps spend time going over the subject together? or maybe he's having other trouble that's affecting his studies"
36031,it's better to do what you're passionate about. do that and success follows
36032,That's cool.  For what class
36033,God works in mysterious ways
36034,"wow. I would be too. I love guitar, it's my favorite musical instrument. I wonder if he was born blind"
36035,"just goes to show that people can be amazing. Just never give up, persistence is the key"
36036,oh no! that sounds annoying. Did you end up getting help?
36037,that sounds terrible! I hope everything gets sorted! Be positive 
36038,"Thats amazing, congratulations. 12 Kids your amazing."
36039,"Haha, your a player."
36040,"That's creepy. What do you think they were, hyenas? "
36041,Must have been quite a sight. 
36042,"Oh,will u be going to pay him a visit?"
36043,Hope u will not indulge in such act like theft again?
36044,"Wow, that is a great news"
36045,"Wow, that is a really good club"
36046,Is this your first son?
36047,Awesome! Any daughters? What will be your sons name?
36048,holy Moses! I hate them things. Flying rats is what they are.
36049,lol. don't do the crime if can't face the Bat ;)
36050,Praise God man! He really is amazing and we should always be grateful for we have 
36051,amen! so true. Its especially awesome when He picks us up in every fall. His love never fails
36052,for real? that must've been embarrassing. Sorry to hear about that
36053,well that's good and bad. hopefully the joke didn't carry on too long
36054,I love me some Tupac. Real talk.
36055,Me too. I always end up on the 90s hip hop station on Pandora.
36056,Sorry to hear that. Did someone do anything against the company selling the food?
36057,Someone should have sued them.
36058,"Oh yes, at least, you will be in a position to help them in return"
36059,That is good. You have a good heart
36060,"You must feel awful,  Why don't you come clean, maybe you will feel better."
36061,Yes Jesus can save you if you ask him.  He always forgive.
36062,"He deserved that, I think."
36063,"Wow, interesting."
36064,"Wow, you must have felt jealous"
36065,"Hahahaa, its not easy though, I would have done same"
36066,"When you have responsibilities that you really care about, you do what you have to. I commend him. ITs hard raising a family,"
36067,Oh wow. Ive never heard of that many sick days.
36068,cool.
36069,"So, what was she lying to you about?"
36070,"Oh, she shouldn't have done that"
36071,Oh no how horrible
36072,I hate public schools ooo
36073,But it's really cool atimes
36074,"Thats cool, I did online school in high school"
36075,Well were pretty close in age
36076,"I remember him, he was going to be a great actor."
36077,Yeah he might do a pretty good job as that character.
36078,Adapting to life is always good to do.
36079,Thats a great attitude to have. You should keep with that.
36080,How awful! how do you feel about it?
36081,"Yes I understand, it is really sad when you find that people you have known a long time can be very different from what you thought."
36082,Lols why didn't you do anything 
36083,"Awww but it's still good that you didn't push him, Cox it might lead to something else "
36084,Oh My Goodness! How wonderful!!!! That is so awesome! Congratulations. 
36085,"Wow! I better! I Stopped at Associates of General Studies, because I wanted to be a mom more. So that is a HUGE step for you! "
36086,This is TRUE! I am glad to be at home with these guys right now. Have a great day! 
36087,Congratulations! I hope to get a house next year
36088,I bet! Hard work pays off
36089,"Things happen that are bad, I am sure it wasnt your fault."
36090,I am sure they forgave you in the end.
36091,"Music always seems to be better from the past, I understand all too well."
36092,"I totally agree, new music is not as good."
36093,I get paid today as well! What game are you thinking about getting?
36094,"Didn't that game come out a few months ago? I got it shortly after I released and I wasn't very impressed. It wasn't a bad game, but it certainly was not the best game."
36095,Congratulations. That sounds like the fast track.
36096,Cool. Maybe next year you will be a partner!
36097,I hope you get it
36098,I am so sorry to hear that! Is there a particular section you are having trouble with?
36099,Ah! That's quite understandable. It is tricky at first and non-intuitive. I practiced driving in reverse with cones in an abandoned lot. 
36100,"I know it's hard, but practice makes perfect! Keep trying and I am sure you will get it!"
36101,Why what is the matter?
36102,Hmmm! That is just annoying being an alcoholic. I purely understand your situation as I have gone through it. Well! life goes on.
36103,that is great..congrats....
36104,Thats creepy honestly
36105,Yeah whispering in someones ear is weird
36106,Nice! What job is going for
36107,"Cool.  Hope he gets it, I hear they pay pretty well"
36108,Just you. No security?
36109,I would be too. 
36110,"That's nice, how long did it take you ?"
36111,"Fantastic, now do you have a job lined up?"
36112,I've been in a fender bender not a total wreck.
36113,"Man, how was your insurance policy for that?"
36114,"Yes, Several times in my life. Mostly me and my older brother when we were younger."
36115,What started the fist fight in the first place?
36116,I haven't heard of it
36117,Everything old makes a come back!
36118,One of my favorite places to eat. I love the swirled ice cream cones.
36119,Over priced food is no fun. I like dollar menus.
36120,Yep! Not really that fun to have since you see things at times.
36121,Man that is scary! Granted i like to hear things about that. 
36122,"Yes when I was young I did all the time, but I think after I turned 18 I got this weird fear of being so high up in the air. What about you?"
36123,Wow thats really cool! You must be happy to know about that stuff its interesting!
36124,What a creep. I hope that you told on him.
36125,Some people are like that. Did you tell your husband?
36126,Where are you headed ?
36127,"Great, I hope you have a nice trip. How long will you be staying?"
36128,That's great! It was meant to happen then
36129,I would have been too. I've never been fired. I always quit
36130,I remember taking Home Ec. I loved that class
36131,"Oh wow, puppies are nice.  What kind of puppy did you get?"
36132,"Thats a nice breed of dog.  I just went on a camping trip with a relative who has one, they are very loyal and smart of course.  Was he/she your first pet?"
36133,that's good! you should be proud of yourself
36134,that's great! i hate when people cheat
36135,"I can only imagine having to wait at the table alone, wondering if she'd show up. At least, it sounds like, she finally arrived.  Did she specify a reason for being so late?"
36136,"That's good. I can somewhat relate. I think the longest I've waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour, and ended up getting delayed by our boss for 45 minutes. We were glad she made it out, but I did feel worse for her than for all of us."
36137,"Ahhh! Me too, there is so much that can be done on the weekends!"
36138,I understand that! I have a bunch of pet snakes that wake me up thru the night!
36139,"Actually that has happened to me, during Thanksgiving"
36140,"Im from NC mountains, it can be tricking driving when the snow is latying fast"
36141,"That is a smart idea. Sometimes I would have no choice, but to keep going, bacsue of having to drive to work.No matter what the weather is."
36142,I understand your pain. My parents are also separated.
36143,It just makes you mature faster. Just look at it like blessing in disguise.
36144,That sucks.   Did you end up coming up with an alternate plan?
36145,That's good to hear.  How was the beach?
36146,That would take away from her time with you. Was it for you?
36147,That would be a really nice surprise then!
36148,why'd you steal it 
36149,oh yea what kind of shirt was it 
36150,What did you do to pass the time?
36151,I love video games.
36152,"That sucks, why didn't you find a new apartment?"
36153,Maybe you should leave Florida.
36154,"Oh thats nice, what was she able to get for you?"
36155,thats awesome of her to be able to get you something you really wanted
36156,"Omg, I have seen one of those!"
36157,Did she get mad at you?
36158,haha that sucks! did you take him/her out to pee recently?
36159,What did you have for lunch?
36160,"That is amazing, good work."
36161,How long did it take you?
36162,Oh wow. Did she break up with you?
36163,Don't sweat it man. There is plenty of fish in the sea anyways.
36164,"Nice, I wish I could do a wheelie!"
36165,"Yeah, I tried skateboarding in my childhood but was too scared to break something, lol."
36166,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you ever figure out what happened?"
36167,"Oh, well that's a somewhat happy ending I suppose."
36168,Haha I'm sorry! My dog is chill now but he ate a hole in the wall when he was a puppy lol
36169,Yeah lol what breed is yours? Mine is a golden so he loves eating stuff. Now it's thankfully just actual food.
36170,"Yea, I am like that, too. Did you apologize?"
36171,"It happens. Like you said, we can't all be perfect."
36172,Who did you do all those things with? Sounds like a wonderful day!
36173,They must have been really happy.
36174,There are so many spectacular views on this planet
36175,It's a shame that people are letting these marvels pass them by.
36176,That can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people
36177,No not really because we are all human and make mistakes.
36178,"Oh, wow! My son was terrified of tornadoes because of that darn movie, and we don't really even get tornadoes where we live! Did you ever live through a tornado?"
36179,"Aw, poor little thing! How did you overcome this? Or, are you still afraid of them?"
36180,"Your mom sounds awesome!  Wow, what a cool thing to say!  "
36181,We get carried away with our emotions sometimes. Did you explain it to them?
36182,I'm glad you're not too prideful to admit your mistakes to your kids and used it as a teaching opportunity.
36183,"That is pretty awesome, I know if I ever got the chance it would change my life as well."
36184,"I understand that, as long as I could understand the language I think I would be great anywhere."
36185,if its an older iphone i would treasure it 
36186,everyone values things differently
36187,"Oh wow, that is a dangerous job."
36188,have you had it tested ?
36189,so you have like tunnel vision where ?
36190,"Yeah, that can be annoying especially in Walmart since so many people go there. It stresses you out when you don't need it to."
36191,"Yeah, everyone just seems miserable, so it kind of drags you down, too. But it's a necessary evil."
36192,"that is why I am scared to have kids, that sounds terrible"
36193,"that seems to be the case, you win some you lose some I guess"
36194,Who would that be?
36195,I love seeing mine too. I know how happy that must make you feel. Mine are local.
36196,thats good to hear.  my kids will returning to school soon as well.  I cant wait!
36197,Every little accomplishment counts! What bills did you have to pay?
36198,"Sorry to hear that. Well, at least this will be a weight off your shoulders."
36199,"wow, you're so determined! Did you pass your exam?"
36200,yay! congrats! that's really awesome. you should be proud of yourself
36201,That's really exciting! I would be so happy about that. 
36202,That's what I would do too. Do you have something in mind? 
36203,Forget him. Get yourself a real man.
36204,"If he really loved you, he would pay attention to your every need. Kick him to the curb."
36205,Be positive. Don't deviate your mind while driving. Concentrate completely on driving. You can.
36206,Sorry to hear this. Hope you'll get out from this fear and become a good driver. 
36207,Sounds cool.
36208,Do you cook a lot with tomatoes
36209,People just don't seem to pay attention when they are in a hurry.
36210,That's the part that bothers me the most. When they just cut in front of you with no warning.
36211,I know a lot of people in real life through that kind of stuff. Has been pretty great for me after 11 years. How is it for you so far.
36212,Well we met through going to conventions and i even visited some myself. Really great bunch of people and i see places.
36213,well you sound like a good person
36214,why thank you!
36215,Oh wow. That's crazy.
36216,I'm glad you made amends then and no drama.
36217,That's pretty amazing. She must be skillful regardless.
36218,"Yea, experience and skills matter a lot more."
36219,I am familiar with that.  That is frustrating.
36220,I ask myself the same thing.  Sometimes I think they get mad at something we do.
36221,That is good. Do you have strong feeling for each other?
36222,That is cute
36223,Things? Like what kind of things?
36224,"I know what you mean! I'm literally doing the same thing right now, babysitting my neighbor's dogs in her big two-story house, all alone. Makes me feel like someone's watching me..."
36225,Thats really good to hear.  Whats going on?
36226,I work from home too.  Its so nice to be able to do laundry and things on my breaks.  Im so productive around the house
36227,and I can stay in my PJs all day long!
36228,"Yeah, of course I can! That sounds heartless. Maybe that shows you who your friends truly are, and you should maybe look elsewhere... Could be a wake-up call."
36229,"Oh, I misunderstood! I thought you meant you weren't invited to one that you later found out about. Hah! Then I guess the wake-up call is you have really good friends! So, you like surprise parties then? I never did."
36230,What kinds of things are you talking about?
36231,"That's not very fair, a kind reminder could've gone a long way."
36232,I have been there many times.
36233,I love going to the Spurs games.
36234,"Yes, where did you go to college?"
36235,That is so disgusting.  I hate seeing that!
36236,Sugar will do that to kids every time.  Just don't let them on a  roller coaster to make it even worse.
36237,That sounds really painful!  You should pick them up.
36238,They must not listen very well.
36239,"Qdoba is the BOMB! Although, I think I prefer Chipotle slightly more."
36240,"Yeah, but Chipotle has queso now! But, yeah, it isn't as good as Qdoba queso. "
36241,Wow! How is that even possible?
36242,I wonder if they ever feel like they don't get a childhood?
36243,Sounds like you are lucky.
36244,I figure your son is pretty happy as well.
36245,couldn't ask for a better day
36246,"That is no fun, you always hope that first one hits so they are more receptive the rest of the time"
36247,Well there is always next time!
36248,you should take the dogs to a dog park after work and meet people!
36249,Definitely. I think even Waze app will tell you in you search 'around me'. 
36250,"Wow, that is sweet of him, does he have a crush on you?"
36251,"Huh, well maybe he is starting his campaign lol"
36252,"I get that, some are just not well trained at all"
36253,Oh? That's not good. Do you think he has lots of secrets?
36254,I'm sorry :( I do hope things can be worked out
36255,I assume you don't get to see them often?
36256,That's too bad. I bet you miss them.
36257,Sorry to hear about the bad news.
36258,How long ago did she die?
36259,I hope you got it.
36260,Congrats! You deserve it for keeping your faith!
36261,"Well, you know she'll get over it, but it does hurt."
36262,"oh, how nice. What are your plans in that regard for the future?"
36263,What a dream come true for you that'll be.
36264,"Oh man, bills. That's awesome!"
36265,Does anyone help you with the bills?
36266,awh thats so sweet how long have you two known one another? 
36267,sounds like a great friendship! 
36268,Oh no. How old is he?
36269,Friendship is special. Did he do something to his friend?
36270,"Man, that's gotta be a horrible feeling. I think it would help if you try not to compare yourself to others."
36271,I hope things turn out better for you. Keep fighting.
36272,"Oh man, that's awesome. I hope you get it!"
36273,Glad you rocked that interview. Sounds like it's gonna be a sweet gig.
36274,Awww I bet that brought back memories.
36275,What will you do with it now?
36276,"That's pretty much teaching their kids to worry about appearances than learning, too. That's too bad."
36277,Did you name it?
36278,That's cute. I bet he's happy.
36279,"You kinda want to hold their hand, but you know it's best they solve some problems on their own. You can't be with them all the time."
36280,It is truely for the best. Try not to worry.
36281,that's amazing! She must be excited.
36282,Must be nice to have more income coming into the family.
36283,Is he going to be okay?
36284,Well I bet he appreciates that. We all want to be babied sometimes.
36285,Lol. Did you tell her? You can just buy another one.
36286,Just buy another one and don't eat it. lol
36287,That's sucks. Does the culprit know?
36288,That is unacceptable. What are you going to do?
36289,That sounds so fun! 
36290,Take some medication with you just in case.
36291,So...what happened to her
36292,In real life? Or are you making this up
36293,I've never imagined something like that before. Where did you see this?
36294,That's nuts. Did the owner do anything?
36295,I suffer a lot too when my wife is gone. What happened to him?
36296,"Ah, the evil cancer. Took my grandmother as well. I am sure he's off in a better place now."
36297,Nice! How old is your nephew?
36298,That's good. Gotta build and maintain those family bonds. I should be doing the same once my nephew gets older.
36299,That sucks. Can you make it up to her somehow?
36300,"At least those things come in sets, so you can keep part of it?"
36301,It is a work award or something?
36302,I am sure you are going to get it.
36303,Why Thank you!
36304,THanks for being so understanding!  I feel a little better now.
36305,I know what you mean. Did you get the job?
36306,I have not. What is it?
36307,"There are some bad parents out there, that's for sure. Is it hard to be a parent?"
36308,"Lol, that is terrible. She should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck..."
36309,That sucks. Maybe it's time to get new friends?
36310,"Don't worry, it will get better. I know you deserve better"
36311,"I know exactly what you mean. My sister is entering her teenage years. I feel like it's all I can do to just not be annoying to her, so I can't even imagine what it's like for a mom."
36312,That's good! All it takes is a good day once in a while to keep things on track until they get older. My mom just tries to be as patient and considerate with my sister so that she still feels motivated to communicate with her.
36313,I've never been to California.
36314,That must of been terrible.
36315,Did anyone help you?
36316,You're making me want to do the same thing. That sounds great!
36317,Nothing like relaxing and getting your body ready for a night of good sleep!
36318,Was it on the phone or in person?
36319,What are you referring to?
36320,That is nce
36321,thank you for what?
36322,okay
36323,"you're welcome, but for what?"
36324,ok then lol
36325,Cool. Thats a fun hobby.
36326,Well habe fun I guess.
36327,"Oh, that's odd! I'm sorry they didn't tell you what was going on. "
36328,No problem! I hope so too. Good luck with that!
36329,Who was your rep?
36330,Aha. What was the association?
36331,Did you got bored?
36332,That is a very long drive! How long will it take to get there?
36333,"It must be very good, if you're willing to go that far!"
36334,"Wow, you're very lucky. Do you share the facilities with other people?"
36335,Which part of the country are you in? Are you by the beach?
36336,Was it recently? Happy Birthday
36337,"Oh goodness, what happened for the past 3 weeks?"
36338,"Oh, I was thinking something bad happened."
36339,Sorry to hear this! I can understand your pain. 
36340,Take care of yourself and your family.
36341,"I am sure it will be fine, do you have a preference"
36342,I am happy for you then
36343,"That is good, it is very important to be loyal in a healthy relationship!"
36344,"Good for you! I wish more people were like this, unlike my ex! "
36345,You should channel that envy into motivation!
36346,"Exactly, be positive and you can buy one for yourself!"
36347,That is a great attitude to have!  It is great to have an optimistic approach to life.
36348,I feel the same way.  We are a glass half full kind of people!
36349,"oh poor thing, is she at least getting better?"
36350,"haha that must be nice too though, you get your own alone time for the most part!"
36351,"I see, you must have felt hopeful"
36352,"Good, one should always be positive"
36353,thats adorable how old is she? 
36354,she sounds like it 
36355,That's a pretty heavy realization...better tell him now that regret it later
36356,Best of luck to you
36357,what are your options? 
36358,oh yeah thats always going to be up and coming for sure 
36359,"It is an excellent opportunity, to know other people and places, to open up to the possibility, I assure you that it will go to you very well"
36360,You do the same thing ... the opportunity is for both
36361,"That sounds like it's rough, did your father accept your apology?"
36362,"Well, I'm sure he understands, and you shouldn't feel too bad, as long as you apologized you're fine."
36363,it happens we have to reward ourselves sometimes. dark chocolate is actually good for you! 
36364,hey it was just one day! you got this... work extra hard for the next 5 days! 
36365,That's awesome
36366,I'm sure your supportiveness inspires him to work as hard as he does
36367,I totally feel you on that. I swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window. 
36368,"My bedroom is first floor, and literally maybe 4 feet from the parking lot. Lucky me. Lucky you tho too with animals. lol "
36369,Did you retrace your steps
36370,"I used to lose stuff all the time.  Then I learned to relax and actively imagine all the places I'd been to.  It worked for me then, found a G-shock watch a pair of nikes and my wallet"
36371,that's great! I bet they are equally excited if not more :) are you travelling alone?
36372,oh i bet! you guys will have such a wonderful time together
36373,"I would be too, that is a long time!"
36374,Wow that would make for a lonely timeframe
36375,Wow did youcall someone about that?
36376,"Wow, that sucks, that is why I wanna live all alone!"
36377,"Oh my, did they notice you farted?"
36378,"Must have rather awkward. Remember, farting is just natural and I am sure she understands that."
36379,"I am sorry, how have you been passing the time"
36380,"I love video games, you should buy a switch!"
36381,that is a very optimistic way to look at life . i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way
36382,how long have you looked at life this way? is it sustainable ?
36383,this is completely true. it involves totally re conditioning the mind .
36384,i would totally attempt it 
36385,I am so very sorry. Have you had time to talk about it
36386,"that's good prayer can comfort, maybe you should talk to your pastor"
36387,"Ooh, that's a big jump. I was considering the same thing, but I' one state above :)"
36388,"I put it on hold until I fly up there this year to check things out. It's quite a big decision, and I would recommend going there for a while just to see what it's like"
36389,"Yes, realistically I wish it were possible to do that everyday but general stresses of life get in the way "
36390,"Maybe thats a good idea, to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on. Good idea!"
36391,Do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?
36392,Same here.  Try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime.
36393,You must be ver
36394,*very excited.  (oops).  Where did she go?
36395,"that sounds like fun, where in the ozakrs?"
36396,Sounds like you made the right decision.  What a bunch of A-holes
36397,Hm maybe she liked you ha
36398,Free pizza is good! How did you get it?
36399,It was fine how about you?
36400,I'm not sure I feel comfortable telling you as we just met.
36401,My day was great so far!  How about you?
36402,That is good to hear!  I'm am sure you are grateful to experience such a good day!
36403,Oh that sucks :( Maybe organize the socks better?
36404,"Ah. Well, chalk it up to one of those funny but awkward moments of life then!"
36405,That's great! When will you find out?
36406,"I know how it feels to be homesick, but you have to put your wife first."
36407,You and your wife should go out to events and try to meet new people.
36408,"Ohh man, that is a long time to be alone.  What are you going to do while she is gone?"
36409,I'm sorry.  Where did she go?
36410,What happened? Did someone bump on your car?
36411,"Be carefull , you don't know the cray people that is out there."
36412,That must have been awkward.
36413,Don't worry about it. It happens to the best of us.
36414,"Nostalgia can be wonderful, can't it?"
36415,I feel the same when listening to 90s alternative music
36416,What was going on!?
36417,sounds like a lot of drama ugh i hope you get some rest tonight 
36418,that's really good you feel pretty secure about it then?
36419,oh wow then that is really good! For someone to say that! You should be very proud of yourself.
36420,Thar was an embarasing moment for sure
36421,Maybe you are felling lonely these days?
36422,Did you have an enemy or someone as a suspect?
36423,Weird reaction. I feel like he should just do his job and not key your car.
36424,What are you worrying about?
36425,"Well, I hope it's alright, heart problems is not something you should take lightly."
36426,What is your favorite memory with your friends?
36427,That sounds like so much fun! I'm glad you got to go back to revisit.
36428,You deserved for graduating.
36429,Just keep working hard and make them proud.
36430,I'm glad to hear you have something you can lean on in hard times. I'm personally an Atheist but I can respect someone with faith.
36431,"I absolutely agree. As long as you aren't hurting anyone, do whatever you please!"
36432,"Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that! It doesn't necessarily mean it went bad, though. Maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?"
36433,Keep your head up! Job hunting is usually stressful for most people. You got this!
36434,I'm not jealous of my co-worker though?  What makes you think i'm jealous?
36435,I didn't say that.
36436,"That would be sad, do you keep him in a cage?"
36437,"That's nice, what does he enjoy watching?"
36438,Absolutely. Although the world isn't so black and white. Sometimes a person may have to steal to survive. Is it really wrong then?
36439,I agree. Stealing someone else's possession when it wasn't necessary for your survival is despicable! I hate a thief!
36440,"That's so sad, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. How did it happen?"
36441,"My goodness, that sounds like a tragedy. I'm sure she was a great dog friend of yours."
36442,Do you have some big plans for the visit?
36443,"Uh oh, have you ever delivered a baby before?"
36444,"Oh right, I am a doctor."
36445,I am a baby delivering doctor!
36446,What was the accomplishment again?
36447,"Wow, that's amazing. What made her want to go back to school?"
36448,What about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?
36449,What's been bothering you at work? Are you not being fulfilled enough?
36450,Oh no! I hope it didn't fall on anything or anyone!
36451,Oh thats really nice! Its important to help each other out when things like that happen!
36452,Who??? Male or female.Actor or singer?
36453,Please tell me who she is!!!!!
36454,"I know exactly how you feel, I've been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently. It was so much better when I had the money to pay for everything."
36455,"Hahaha yes, you are so right. Then again, I'm a Christian so I am also comforted when I remember that we have a real, more important and awesome life to look forward to one day."
36456,"Wow, that's terrible. Was anything stolen or damaged?"
36457,"What a story, it's just unbelievable how these robbers have absolutely no morals."
36458,That is is awful.Did you call the cops
36459,You should install security cameras outside your house.
36460,That's rough man. Got any back up interviews lined up?
36461,I hope that you hear back from them soon. It ain't going to be rough forever - someone has got to recognize your worth eventually!
36462,"Oh no, that is terrible! What happened? What did you do!"
36463,I am so sorry that happened to you!
36464,"Yuck, sounds like an unpleasant feeling. How do you even get hair up there!"
36465,"Well, at least she loves you. Maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that."
36466,Oh really?! Where you headed too?
36467,Wow! Thats on the east side of Africa isn't it? 
36468,Did you have a severe diarreia or something?
36469,I am sure your friend will forgive you.
36470,Oh cool! How did you win it? 
36471,Oh cool! I love chess! What did you win? 
36472,"Wow that's annoying, my husband is always telling me about his co-workers being the same way. "
36473,Yeah I see what you mean. Hopefully he might realize eventually.
36474,Sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone.
36475,"Well, a wise man said that having patience was a virtue, I think you're becoming a more virtuous person by waiting."
36476,I think you should always focus on your strength then it won't matter who is there and what they say
36477,Also having at least one  friend in such meetings  would help. Next time  go with someone you know
36478,"That's great, how wonderful! I hope y'all had a good time."
36479,"How great, I'm glad to hear that."
36480,How old was the child?
36481,"Wow, that's awfully young for that kind of thing."
36482,Oh that's not good. It is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere
36483,Sometimes revamping leads to more amazing results than you could have orginially anticipated
36484,Oh no! Are you going away this weekend?
36485,"Hopefully, she answers soon. Maybe she's taking a nap or is in the shower."
36486,"I am in the same boat, but I think that I can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of I have. "
36487,How funny! I know how you feel though. I have always been poor.
36488,Happiness is within and I seek that all the time. Even rich people are sad and unhappy. 
36489,Why? How did that happen?
36490,That's so sad. I feel sorry for you. 
36491,Yeah. Do you have back up plans for this issue?
36492,"That's nice, I'm glad you feel that way."
36493,"I do feel that way, I try to always have a Christian attitude."
36494,That's nice of her! It's always good to have friends to fall on
36495,"Oh, that's even better. That's truly a friend you can rely on. You're very fortunate."
36496,Skateboarders have some serious skills! I can barely walk a straight line.
36497,We all have different talents. Mine do not lie in those kind of stunts either lol! 
36498,Maybe you could try to better that?
36499,You could start a trend.
36500,He will make it
36501,It will help eventually
36502,That must have been scary. It could have gone really badly.
36503,I hope the owner knows better next time.
36504,Oh man! I hear you. I rescue animals and it is VERY hard to potty train them!
36505,For sure! It is much like potty training a kid. Actually I think dogs are easier then kids lol!
36506,THat is stressful.  Are they ok?
36507,That is really good to hear
36508,I certainly do.  Lucky to be healthy and able
36509,Good question.  I am thankful to be able to park my car in my garage!
36510,I hope you get the job! What was the position you applied for?
36511,That sounds like it pays nice?
36512,No. Why do you ask?
36513,I'm sorry to hear that. How far along in the process are you?
36514,I actually do not have any kids right now
36515,I heard that was a really fun game though!
36516,Seems like we all have. Some people shirk having to though.
36517,Oh no.I hope she gets better.
36518,"Well that's good, sometimes it's our failures that really show us what we're made of. "
36519,Congratulations. I am in my twenties and still can't drive so hopefully I will get my license next year.
36520,Did you say anything to someone?
36521,a Burger King near me got shut down for that!
36522,"No, I do not have kids. Yours?"
36523,I bet you were really proud!
36524,Wow. Thats hard to believe lol.
36525,"Yeah, it sounds that way."
36526,"That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers, they are so slow sometimes."
36527,"Stores should really open more checkouts when it is busy, especially during rush our!"
36528,"Man, I'm so jealous of you. I love that new puppy stage, as tumultuous as it can be. There's just so much emotion and ""new feelings"" going on as you watch it grow."
36529,"Yeah, but then there's also those late nights where you have to take them out because they're not used to holding their pee/poop in. And also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with. They just have unlimited energy, so it's hard to keep up sometimes, but also fun!"
36530,What were simpler times?
36531,"Ah, I see. Had a great childhood, hu?"
36532,Congrats! That would be really exciting. What was your project?
36533,That's a very interesting topic. I would have loved to have seen that!
36534,I know what that's like. I have three kids.
36535,They never slept in the crib lol. I won't even make my son get a haircut because he cries so much when the clippers get close. I'm the wrong one to come to for advice lol
36536,That sounds heavenly
36537,I envy you.  Have fun!
36538,Time sure does fly and change is inevitable
36539,Thinking about past events can be very nostalgic
36540,time to find a new job it sounds like! good luck
36541,Awesome! What is he in college for?
36542,Holy goodness! That is really specialized. You should be very proud! :)
36543,"That is very good to hear, hopefully things truly turn around for him."
36544,"Not yet, i just have one dog."
36545,Oh that's neat! Did you find anything good?
36546,Oh I remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday! 
36547,"Wow, that's incredible. I don't even make my own bed. "
36548,Of course... haha. Why doesn't anyone pay adults to make their beds?
36549,"Wow, that sounds very disgusting."
36550,I hope the baby rat is okay.
36551,I'm so sorry but great to hear she is better now!
36552,Well I'm glad to hear it's resolved.
36553,"Oh that's nice, I love doing that. Did the cat seem happy?"
36554,"Well how nice, that must have been fun."
36555,Wow that must have been scary!
36556,How long were you lost for?
36557,"Wow back up there friend, what are you talking about?"
36558,"Context, what the heck are you talking about?"
36559,Seriously what the hell are you talking about??
36560,"Being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response. Despite this, you never know what is going on behind the scenes, she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips."
36561,"I bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her. Instead, you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future."
36562,You just had a baby?! I didn't even know you were expecting!
36563,I'm so happy for you! Have you decided on a name yet?
36564,Good for you! I have heard many great things about keto. How are you finding it?
36565,"Props to you for researching the diet without understanding how it works. Some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast, but putting in effort goes a long way."
36566,You must be over the moon happy.
36567,Very funny. Have you decided on a name yet?
36568,Happy belated Birthday! Did it turn out the way you had hoped?
36569,What did you get instead?
36570,Really? That is a good move
36571,You have As because you have high interest in studying  
36572,"Wow, that is truly incredible! What is your secret?"
36573,That is so true! You are a true weight loss warrior I think!
36574,Do you like it now?
36575,I like 2% as well.  It's perfect for cereal and chocolate milk!
36576,Have you tried 1%?
36577,That's great.  2% is much more healthful than whole milk.
36578,so very bad ya
36579,Oh no! :(   How are you taking it?
36580,Dang.  Please don't blame yourself.
36581,"Thats pretty long, how did you manage?"
36582,"Yea, something calming helps during fraustrating moments, but at least you know how the route is now"
36583,Nice! Who's Robby? Is that your husband?
36584,Aha! Was it actually your anniversary today? Happy Anniversary!
36585,"Oh, wow... um, that's crazy. Why did you do that? "
36586,"I would imagine! I'd do the same thing if I was your dad, haha."
36587,You sound like a caveman
36588,Why you no hunt and send wife instead.
36589,"Oh I can relate to that especially if you are not prepared for it, it can get really scary"
36590,You guys will be alright trust me I  experienced same with my partner and now we are fine. Our kid is a teenager now. I am happy for you guys
36591,"Oh no! I'm not sure how all that works, but I thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman"
36592,Well I'm glad for you! And for him! A new life is exciting
36593,That's so sad. You did your best. How old was she?
36594,"That's really good, though. It sounds like you gave her a great life."
36595,Was he with you or just someone you wanted to be with?
36596,"In that case, you are better off without her. "
36597,"Oh, wow, I wish my parents had done that! It would have saved me from the mountain of debt I have now"
36598,"Well, I've always been of the mindset that (if they can) they should help the first 2 years as that's usually the break-in period. After that, the child should be able to manage"
36599,I bet that felt good to get out and experience that!
36600,Oh I am sorry to hear that. I also enjoy dogs. They are one of life's great joys in my opinion.
36601,You should take a vacation that will help you relax and see new stuff
36602,Oh ok. In that case let someone very close like your mother come around to help you out. Having someone to talk to helps in times like this
36603,That's awesome. Are you using any special types of lotion?
36604,I'll have to do the same! I wish my skin looked better than it does.
36605,You must be wealthy. I would love to visit NYC
36606,OMG! I know how you feel
36607,"Oh, me too! I love digging out my N64 and SNES from time to time."
36608,"Yes, that Yamaha sound chip was magical. We call it the Genesis over here."
36609,"Wow, that must have been a terrible experience."
36610,so very nice.your doughter.
36611,whove very nice ya and super talent.
36612,What does what mean exactly?
36613,"Well whatever went wrong, I hope it can be fixed somehow."
36614,Oh no! Did you take the kitten to an animal hospital or care for it yourself?
36615,"Awe, that's a sweet story! The kitten got a happy ending!"
36616,That's great! Who did the travelling?
36617,She must be a strong woman.
36618,Oh no. I hope you got somewhere safe while it was going on.
36619,That's good at least. Living in an area with tornados is so scary!
36620,Oh that is fantastic! I bet your brother was pretty happy too.
36621,That is very sweet. I think they will have a happy and lasting marriage.
36622,That's exciting! What kind are you looking for?
36623,Ah. Hopefully something with good gas mileage!
36624,"OK ,have you done the need full?"
36625,OK get started already. A stich in time saves nine  !
36626,Oh I think I can guess which retailer you're talking about. I've had so many problems with them over the years
36627,"I know. Canada isn't even overseas in the literal sense, it's just over the border!"
36628,Unbelievable. You must be very angry with her (whoever she is).
36629,"Neither would I, I dislike such greedy people "
36630,Wow that must have been frustrating.  I hope it didn't cost too much.
36631,I know how that is.  At least you have your car back!
36632,I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds very rough. What happened to it?
36633,Oh jeez that's really awful. Can you get it back?
36634,What didn't she like?
36635,Well that makes sense.
36636,Congrats you have a baby on the way
36637,How many kids do you want in total?
36638,Oh no. How did you handle having two such big priorities come up?
36639,"Oh, sorry to hear. I am sure your child was glad you were home. Is she or he feeling better now?"
36640,Sit where?
36641,The club isn't a great place to find the right kind of girl anyways.  
36642,This somehow seems inappropriate.
36643,What is your plan to accomplish that? 
36644,"Just don't over do, you have to enjoy being a parent, that's a key to happy kids."
36645,Did you spill something?
36646,Was it liquid ?
36647,What was brutal?
36648,Really? No shower for few days?
36649,ok. I understand 
36650,"i would feel terrible to thats really bad, you should just tell her and change! "
36651,"The truth can set us free, probably better for her and you both. "
36652,Sorry to hear that... they say time heals everything but i disagree its been 9 years for me and it still feels like yesterday. How long for you? 
36653,Im really sorry for your loss! I hope that someday it gets better for the both of us. 
36654,Oh I love seeing kids achieve things! Adorable. Good for her! :) 
36655,"I am sure, I would be too of my daughter. You sound like an awesome parent. "
36656,oh.. well i understand. but that was a long time ago right?
36657,"come clean to them about any major lies, you'll feel better :)"
36658,haha.. i feel you. my mom feels the same way
36659,Amen sister! women always keep things in check
36660,thats really good of you. she is a lucky gal
36661,haha.. i guess she was not as good as your girl huh?
36662,"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you considering getting a new dog?"
36663,"I understand, mine just turned 15 and I'm not looking forward to that day."
36664,Jeez people just always have to be in a hurry to get no where right. 
36665,people are just selfish and only consider their own lives! 
36666,It's okay.  
36667,That is pretty cool! What made you want to become a lawyer?
36668,"Great! I know it can be a tough job, I am sure you will do fine, keep studying!"
36669,Well there are plenty more girls out there
36670,Oh no. Did you leave?
36671,Like you had a different kind of accident lol
36672,Honestly that sounds pretty fun to me I havent been to bingo in years. I love listening to the older people arguing when someone wins. 
36673,hope you feel better
36674,it was fine. How about you?
36675,Nothing special...
36676,Too hot for anything
36677,seems plausible
36678,as you should
36679,ohh good luck!
36680,"Oh thats great, what are the animals?"
36681,"Oh wow, I love hippos and I don't know what sloth look like will let google help me out :)"
36682,Maybe? Is it that big of a deal to you?
36683,Meaning you have been happier before or you are more happy now than you have been?
36684,"Oh wow, that's great! I would be very happy too!"
36685,oh its hurts a little
36686,Me too! Have you ever been to one of them races?
36687,"Oh cool, do you live in the city?"
36688,That is awesome!  Is there a particular reason you are so happy?
36689,That is something to be happy about!  Congratulations!
36690,That is an exciting purchase! What kind did you get?
36691,That is a nice car! I know you are enjoying that!
36692,That was such a nice thing to do! She seems very caring!
36693,That is so nice that she made note that you had been wanting it for so long! 
36694,That is SO exciting! I remember how that felt!
36695,That will come! The hardest part is over now!
36696,The company you work for is horrible. They should have gave you that time off because it was a family emergency.
36697,"Ew, that is not good! I wouldn't have been able to stay and eat."
36698,I do not blame you!
36699,"that is awesome, i feel the same when i drive by my grandparents old home"
36700,yes i was
36701,That is exciting! I love having pictures to look back on. 
36702,I love being able to reminisce on the past. Time goes by so fast. 
36703,"I had Hurricane Matthew come through where I live too! NE FL, I know how you feel, only I couldn't get gas for my car because there was no gas anywhere!"
36704,"Yeah you thought ahead, me not so much. Our house was fine but a HUGE mess to clean up in the yard and no power for 2 days. I hope your house was ok too!"
36705,Was it a checkup or did you have some health issue?
36706,Did everything go well or do you not know yet?
36707,"Oh man, I bet that is fun"
36708,"No, I have always wanted one though"
36709,Was it someone you know? Sorry for your loss if it was.
36710,I'm sorry did you get to see her a lot before she passed?
36711,Omg! That is terrible. They should really be considerate of people's time
36712,Right. Did he at least apologize for the long wait
36713,"Wow! I would write a review, and choose another doctor who actually cares about his patient!"
36714,Good luck! What is it on?
36715,How much studying did you do leading up to it?
36716,"Oh man, I bet that will be fun"
36717,"I have, I love going when I can"
36718,That's really nice of him! How long have you been married?
36719,Well you made the right choice in man to marry lol. What kind of necklace?
36720,"That either sounds like a locket, or a heart shaped key. Am I close at all?"
36721,Cool I think I saw a commercial for that actually.
36722,Ut oh.. what happened?
36723,hehehe.. don't mind if I giggle do you?  You need to remember... don't feel embarrassed bout silly stuff like that.  Those people don't know you or really care.  They laugh like I did because its fun to see things happen to other people that we fear. 
36724,What are you going to do about it
36725,Well be careful for sure
36726,I am sorry to hear that. Have you ever talked to your parents about that?
36727,"Yes, you do.Otherwise, you are going to carry that pain the rest of your life."
36728,That is great that your hard work has paid off.
36729,Now you having something to celebrate. Congrats!
36730,"Dont worry, anyone would have felt the same way. If it makes you feel better remember that we were all babies once."
36731,"Yeah thats important, did you have music you could have listened to or something?"
36732,Loyalty is a good thing
36733,"Oh wow, that is loyalty for sure"
36734,I wish I had a grandma.. did she send you anything extra?
36735,That is still really sweet.  I never knew any of mine.  Treasure her while you can!
36736,"Wow, must have been rather frightening. Glad you are ok!"
36737,I hope you have all the emergency essentials you need for next time.
36738,Gardening can be peaceful
36739,Nature is a wonderful thing
36740,Oh how exciting!  What do you have planned?
36741,I bet she is going to be so surprised!  Is she hard to surpise?
36742,Well I'm sure everything will go great!
36743,yeah that's tough. But can you imagine how bad you might feel if he had a REALLY good time on the date and really thought things were going somewhere with the two of you?
36744,That is true. Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint. 
36745,"Oh wow, I have heard that can happen with that food"
36746,"Ha, that is funny"
36747,ewww! that is just super gross dude!
36748,Oh man that is just crazy! Feel bad for the person who has to clean it.
36749,I would love to have that tv
36750,"Keep it, the guilt will go away"
36751,Women these days. I don't think i'll ever understand them.
36752,"Exactly, sometimes I think women like drama."
36753,It must have been fun to catch up with them.
36754,Well I hope you guys continue to stay in touch.
36755,"Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner."
36756,That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.
36757,That's awesome. What are you going to do about it?
36758,I'm envious. Do you have any idea of what those plans are?
36759,oh i know friends like those
36760,i believe you
36761,"Oh wow, sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?"
36762,Did you have any damage to your home?
36763,That's really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?
36764,I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?
36765,"When did you get separated? By the way, that is terrible to hear."
36766,"Why are you so down, my depressed friend?"
36767,Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?
36768,Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesn't grow mold!
36769,"I hate to hear that, what happened that made it end poorly?"
36770,maybe you can plan another trip together soon - sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other.
36771,"Leave a note on their door. and at the end put ""thanks in advance"" lol"
36772,"Well, you can at least try. "
36773,You could get earplugs lol
36774,Oh man! What happened to your hip?
36775,Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?
36776,"If it's medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks, it's only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won't be charged if you don't win. It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me.."
36777,"Thank you! I hear you..I didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..It's a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it, botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!"
36778,Are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?
36779,Nice! Mowing the lawn isn't fun in the heat unless you're using a super fast one of course
36780,"I agree, the writing part is easy part, but the speaking part is the worst!"
36781,"Maybe so, they say to imagine the crowd naked, but I don't think that helps too much with the writing part."
36782,Same. What are your favorites?
36783,That's funny. I've also seen Trolls about 100 times. My daughter is now sick of it!
36784,I've noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them.
36785,Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.
36786,Yeah I get that. Where did you work?
36787,Oh yum. Not a terrible place to work!
36788,"Yes , work is better with friends."
36789,Really? I'm surprised the only restaurant in town wasn't busy.
36790,Did you see that happen today?
36791,That's pretty cool.  What a nice person.
36792,Whoa!  What were you driving that had no brakes?
36793,That sounds quite scary!  Did everything turn out OK?
36794,Haha!  Awkward.  What did you do?  Did you hurry up and get out of there?
36795,Same here.  I would rather just leave the situation.
36796,Congrats. I want a promotion at my job.
36797,three years.
36798,I think I'm just going to move on.
36799,Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers?
36800,That sound like a wise decision. I think I would just get a blow up doll instead.
36801,Cool. Does that get a bonus?
36802,That's awesome. 
36803,Well now you know you're pretty great at your job.
36804,Was he upset?
36805,I hate when that happens. 
36806,I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions
36807,You are so right.
36808,Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.
36809,Or you can get a variety pack!
36810,That's nice. I could get that here.
36811,Well now you know.
36812,Noice!  What was it about?
36813,"Very cool, are you a scientist?"
36814,Oh no! That's awful.  Or maybe a good thing if he wasn't good for you.  How are you feeling?
36815,I bet.  It can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.  Its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again.
36816,Congratulations!  That is amazing!  You must be a hard worker.  What do you do?
36817,That's an important job though!  You're keeping things running smoothly for that business to thrive.  I'm so happy for you.  Money is tight for me so when I hear someone getting a bonus...it just makes me so happy for them to get that added chunk of money!
36818,"I wish I could relate. I'm a male, so I'll never know the pain and/or the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body. It's such an impressive thing to go through, and no matter what, mothers will never get enough credit. You deserve serious props. What ages are they now?"
36819,"Yeah, I'll consider it. That's a nice thought. My brothers have had 5 kids between them, so I have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime, and they've given me lots of practice, but I'm grateful for that. 15 and 19, that's awesome. You're almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier."
36820,It what?  Its way higher?  If that's what you meant to finish with then I totally feel you.  Especially during the summer with the air conditioning running so much.  
36821,It is ridiculous.  I found out how they measure power that people use in their houses and it doesn't even sound fair to me.  It averages things because it can't specifically tell. 
36822,"Wow, school is right around the corner"
36823,Well that should relieve some stress
36824,"Everyone has those kinds of days, it happens"
36825,I am sure they have forgotten about it
36826,Why not? What was wrong?
36827,Aww I'm sorry. That's a bummer.
36828,It sounds very motivational.
36829,He must be a great speaker.
36830,What are you saving for?
36831,I am sure everything will be fine. Do not stress.
36832,I hope you did well on it.
36833,Just hope for the best and don't worry.
36834,That's great!  I'm happy for you.
36835,What are those things?
36836,That sounds so exciting! Congratulations!
36837,It sounds like you live in a great community.
36838,Oh man. Hopefully things are different now and you have the confidence that you need!
36839,Nothing like taking it out on the weights and gaining the muscles in return! 
36840,I understand that. I am the same way.
36841,I cannot function if I eat anything other than my usual breakfast.
36842,"Unfortunately, I have very little discipline. I'm probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly. "
36843,wow. When that happened?
36844,Sorry to hear that. I hope your insurer will call you back soon.
36845,It is unacceptable. I hope he did not get cold as a result of this
36846,That is pretty sad and heart-breaking to see kids in such situations
36847,Do you have plans to get together? 
36848,How nice of her. You must have been so happy to see her.
36849,"There are usually many ways, but it depends on what you want to do!"
36850,"Well, we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us"
36851,That is so exciting.  what have you done to prepare
36852,"the buggy is important,  I have a baby boy of my own."
36853,Do you have a baby one the way?
36854,do you make enough money to support the baby?
36855,oof that is rough.
36856,those foids deserve it.
36857,"Yes, you only hurt yourself when you get angry."
36858,"Give it some time, maybe she'll change her mind."
36859,thats so sweet of you
36860,oh yea i can imagine glad shes fine
36861,Wow. Do you expect to win?
36862,That is nice. Good luck.
36863,"Nice, me too, are you playing Nintendo games?"
36864,"I remember these game well, like Contra and Battle Toads. "
36865,Was it your first time riding on one? Is there something in particular that makes you afraid?
36866,Was it your only choice to get where you were going?
36867,"Great, what make are getting?"
36868,"Toyota is reliable, are getting an SUV?"
36869,Interesting choice. Did she like it?
36870,That's good to have something in common. Make the memories.
36871,So what is the problem exactly?
36872,Try doing something you never did before.
36873,It is disgusting. What did you do?
36874,You did good. You should have called the manager to tell him know.
36875,There are so many bike trails available now. You are going to have a lot of fun.
36876,I'm glad you were able to get one that you are going to enjoy so much.
36877,That's a big step. I hope it works out for you.
36878,"I like renovation projects. And yes, renting is a waste of money"
36879,"I feel you, I'm in the same boat.  Are you in a two income household?"
36880,"Yep, money spent on bills and food, with little left for fun.  My wife has the same complaint. "
36881,"Oh no, that sounds horrible"
36882,"I am sorry, that is a sad thing to go through"
36883,Why would you not get paid?
36884,I can imagine it is
36885,"Oh my, did it make you emotional?"
36886,Aw hopefully you never lose that picture!
36887,Oh what was the surprise?! 
36888,You should go on a little date if you can. or to the movies!
36889,You should have taken a Uber. You never know what will happen these days.
36890,No problem. Its also worth carrying a taser or pepper spray.
36891,did you pay him back?
36892,thats good thetn
36893,"Oh my, so close! But you can try better next time."
36894,Yes and theres no point mulling over it! 
36895,wow thats crazy.. what ended up happening!
36896,wow thats good
36897,aww.. that must have been a sweet nostaligia. did you had a collection of those?
36898,"I feel happy for ya! I used to collect cards myself, i still have them"
36899,That is great! Did you manage to land the job?
36900,I'm glad to hear that! As long as you keep working hard and trying your best you can do it! 
36901,Are you talking about the city or a person?
36902,I didn't know this broadway show but it seems nice.
36903,"Yeah, I love going to the beach as well! You must have felt so happy there in that moment!"
36904,I feel happy and content just sitting here listening to you describe the experience.
36905,oooh no that's awful 
36906,ok but did you pass the test
36907,That sound amazing.  Dancing is very bonding.
36908,"Well, a night out dancing will go a long way towards reconnecting with the love of your life.  I am happy for you!"
36909,im sorry to hear that.. what happened?
36910,oh.. wow.. sorry that it happened.
36911,"Oh sorry, did he pass away?"
36912,Oh my god.. my hearty condolences. 
36913,That is really cool . Did you have a good time?
36914,It feels so good just to hear you say that
36915,"Oh wow, the broadway show?"
36916,"Oh yea, he is too good at what he does. I heart stunning review for the show as well"
36917,oh congrats on that.. always nice to see family 
36918,did he catch you?
36919,"I feel you, it would be really scary. How did it turn out?"
36920,so happy for you!
36921,Damn! was it a stray dog?
36922,Dear god.. I hope you are alright my friend!
36923,Oh really? I believe you wanted to be a singer yourself huh?
36924,"Well, it is never too late my friend.. pursue your dreams :)"
36925,"Did they follow your instructions, or did they do their own thing?"
36926,Wow!  I didn't expect that answer from you!  That must have been a great surprise!
36927,Oh god.. thats so gross
36928,I would have thrown up right then and there
36929,i was beet red when I realized what had happened.
36930,"Thank you, your so kind"
36931,Is she staying with you ? 
36932,Sounds like everything went better than expected.
36933,Oh dear me.. So sorry to hear that! what did you do?
36934,I really hope things work out for you my friend
36935,Disgusting. Was it the flying variety?
36936,Gross.  We have those here too.  Typically you only see them during the summer.
36937,good for you! that is how it is supposed to be
36938,I wish you the very best on that my friend
36939,i feel like is should be prepared
36940,oh sorry to hear that.. why didn't it work out?
36941,Aw.. i feel you my friend. Hopefully things get better soon enough
36942,"What did you lie about, and why?"
36943,Best advice.  Never confess it.
36944,Damn! Every kid tells such innocent lies.. I bet your were embarassed
36945,"Aww.. Your story is both cute, funny and innocent"
36946,Did you give her one of each?
36947,aweeee that is pretty cute.
36948,Shoot.. I bet it was scary.. How did you handle it?
36949,So glad to hear that buddy. Wishing you are your girl all the very best
36950,Have you been applying to try to get a position?
36951,That's unfortunate.  What are you doing now?
36952,Thankfully they just were checking up on my speed
36953,"Sorry, something wrong with the chat interface"
36954,Sorry to hear that!
36955,Oh no.. Did he pass away?
36956,Hope you feel better
36957,"Uhm.. yeah, sure. I concur!"
36958,"Oh yeah, me too. They have such cool attitude"
36959,holy cow! Thats terrifying. What did you do?
36960,"Hahaha.. I am sorry, i know it was really scary, but to think about it now, it is really funny as well"
36961,Nice.. what type of ticket.. Monopoly?  Price is Right?  Scrabble?  Bingo?
36962,Better luck next time!  I love to scratch!
36963,"That sounds gross, did you get sick from it?"
36964,"Smart move, at least you noticed it and it wasn't hidden under icing or anything"
36965,Oh god.. sorry.. How are you holding up?
36966,Sorry buddy.. hopefully she is at a better place
36967,"losing a loved one is never easy , especially a brother im sorry for your loss"
36968,"I cant imagine the pain you went through, i have 7 brothers and the taught of losing one of them scares me"
36969,I hear ya. Both sides are infected with this issue. 
36970,"Well, they are looking for more viewers. It is not news anymore, it is entertainment."
36971,"That is nice. They are good at that age. I have a 20-year-old, and he is currently ignoring me."
36972,"I understand that. I tried to give him a new table for his apartment, and he blatantly ignored me. I was like, well I don't have to give it to you."
36973,"That blows dude , i bet it was not your fault "
36974,"So they just cleaned house ? Damn that bad , i would assume they would have kept some workers "
36975,I thought walmart was pretty cheap.  I've never been to aldi's
36976,I may need to see if I have one near by.
36977,"I know right? everyone is, with Lebron James coming in"
36978,So true. Lakers going to do well this time around.
36979,Oh god.. so sorry to hear that. May i ask how did it happen?
36980,Sorry.. Hopefully he is at a better place now.
36981,"Aww, such a nice boyfriend in this day and age! She is so lucky."
36982,I assure you she is a keeper. Marry her buddy!
36983,"Good, I hope you make the ends meet"
36984,"I wish you the best of luck, you will be fine!"
36985,Who is hamilton?
36986,"Oh okay, did you see it in NYC?"
36987,That is good to hear.  I am sorry to hear she was hurt. What happened?
36988,Ouch.  What kind of dog?
36989,I'm not a very good dancer.  What kind of dancing did you do?
36990,"Oh wow, that does sound fun"
36991,"Well, if you are willing to try steroids, then you might have a chance of winning. Without it, it is impossible to even participate"
36992,"Well in those contests, you have to be really pumped and by just fruits and vegetables, it is very unlikely"
36993,"For work, when i got a new job"
36994,I'm so sorry.  You have my deepest condolences. Its hard to not feel isolation with the death of someone you are close to.  I can tell you it does get better and you are not alone.  He lives on in you.
36995,Take joy and pride in the memories you have of him.  They are your personal family movies in your mind.  Cherish them because not everyone gets them with their parents.  Its good to find support and counseling too if you need it. Take care of yourself.
36996,"Yeah, i know that feeling. how did you handle it?"
36997,Good for you buddy :) happy for ya
36998,Big houses are a pain in the neck to keep clean.
36999,It does have its benefits.
37000,"damn, thats sick and rough.. He knew you guys were together?"
37001,Can't say he did not deserve that..
37002,That's wonderful!  I do too.  I don't take it for granted because I've been battling Lupus for 13 years and in bed a lot.  Its an amazing world we have! What is on of your favorite things to do outside?
37003,Sounds wonderful!  I really want to take up gardening.  It would go with my new lifestyle I've adopted of eating plant based.  Do you have tips for a beginner?
37004,The rap version?   Doesn't sound all that appealing to me.  Was it that good?
37005,Maybe i'll have to check it out
37006,how did that go
37007,oh thats awesome.. congrats
37008,Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement 
37009,for faith there is no path it is an individual human's thought 
37010,"I am not, I am still young"
37011,"I hope so, I am still not sure if I want kids"
37012,"I have anxiety attacks too,  you feel like you cant catch your breath and you are light headed."
37013,"that is crazy,  Its only usually a few minutes for me before I can talk myself down."
37014,Don't worry. It will be okay. Flights are always safe
37015,Its natural. Do not sweat it.
37016,"That will be *such* a wonderful feeling when you do. I know it's hard when you see someone reach the ""finish line"" first -- are you able to turn that envy into inspiration?"
37017,See? That's terrific! And she's got to love that you can celebrate her victories too -- even more inspiration to support yours!
37018,"I'm like that too, so I can totally relate. Were you able to talk to him about how you felt?"
37019,"I've felt the same way. As I have aged and become more comfortable and secure in my marriage and in myself, those other insecurities and fears dropped off. Good for you for conquering that challenge!"
37020,"Oh, that must be exciting! I bet you were busy making preparations."
37021,That sounds like it was a lot to take in! Congrats to them!
37022,wow.. what do you plan to do ?
37023,Oh really? How did it go?
37024,Great job! I'm so happy for you! Losing weight is hard!
37025,That sounds exciting! Congratulations to her. I bet there was a lot of celebration to be had for such an achievement!
37026,"I bet! But at least now, like you said, she can see what hard work can achieve. Hopefully the path continues in the best way possible and she can get everything you both hope(d) for!"
37027,Did that person betrayed you in any way?
37028,Don't be so hard on yourself for being a frien and trust another people.
37029,"I love reuniting with old friends, helps me remember and appreciate the good times."
37030,I bet that was a long time ago!
37031,I'm sure you studied hard and should be proud of that! I'm positive you nailed it.
37032,Being competitive isn't a bad thing unless you let it get in the way of your personal life. 
37033,How did you meet your friend?!
37034,College and high school friends are always close to the heart. I'm glad she lives fairly close!
37035,That is unfortunate. I hope that it is able to be treated well.
37036,I hope it goes as smooth as possible. Hang in there.
37037,"Wait, were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying? Either one is a little sad to be honest."
37038,It's like losing a family member :(
37039,What happened to him? Are you guys roommates?
37040,That is very bad. Unemployed individual can be very frustrating to deal with
37041,How did they lose so much weight compared to you?
37042,Maybe it has something to do with your diet ?
37043,Getting out of town and way from all of everday life's struggles always sounds like a great time.  Did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to 'really' get away from everything for a minute?
37044,"That sounds like a really relaxing time, I'm jealous."
37045,No refunds for a cancel 1 week before? That sounds like a total scam! I would be furious. Did you ever find a way to get your money back? Because that does not sound legal!
37046,"I hope that you win your money back and then some, you really deserve it after all of that upset!"
37047,Lovely.  What did you do together?
37048,Sounds like a great time.  What has brought that memory back up again>
37049,That must feel lonely.  You should go out and try to meet some people!
37050,Good deal!  Hopefully then you won't feel so alone!
37051,That is frightening! especially if you didn't know whether it was a harmful spider or not! What did you do?
37052,"Oh, so you were able to get that spider away from you! Good job, hopefully that won't have to happen to you again!"
37053,"Wait, summers already over? Next summer?"
37054,Oh really? I thought summer ended after July. You learn something new everyday lol
37055,"You should get a mini fridge and put it in your room, with a lock on it."
37056,"Yea man go for it, don't procrastinate."
37057,"Wow, that truly is devastating. I wish your family can make it through these hard times :("
37058,"If my sister died to breast cancer, I would be so depressed to the point of my health deteriorating too. :("
37059,Amen to that.Life is so unfair it's not even funny.
37060,Life is so complex.We had no idea of the design of that
37061,What is the state and do you like change?
37062,Oh that is all the way into the cold and wet wild! Do you have or will you think of getting sled dogs?
37063,"lol, right. You will have great fun!"
37064,I agree!  Things look really good going forward.
37065,"I hope so as well, especially for my kids sake!"
37066,"Im sorry to hear that , i hope she can find a way stop this before she spirals out of control"
37067,"She really does need an intervention , and family and friends would help greatly , i hope she can get her life back together "
37068,"Oh my god, that's excellent! Congrats!"
37069,"Oh, lol. Did you get to see any sharks at the aquarium?"
37070,"Oh cool, yes that is very interesting. So how big were those whales in feet and the baby too?"
37071,I know how you feel! What did you watch?
37072,It is a pretty good horror.
37073,That is very impressive. She going to make sooo much money
37074,Any employer would hire someone who went to Harvard in a heartbeat. You are a lucky parent!
37075,Nice what kind of car is it they purchased?
37076,Ok that is a nice car what color is it?? 
37077,"That is excellent, what did you major in?"
37078,Oh cool. Do you want to work as a scientist?
37079,Sorry to hear about that.  I wonder if there's any way to fix this situation.  What do you plan to do?
37080,Coming clean is a great way to start.  It's hard since you know she'll be hurt.  Were you having trouble in the relationship before?
37081,When is the last time you seen them?
37082,That's awesome I hope yall have a good time!
37083,Do you still talk with any of your older friends?
37084,Do you have little time from working or other things?
37085,Yikes what was it about?
37086,creepy.  Were you able to fall asleep after watching it?
37087,That's great. I bet it is a very special place for you two.
37088,Sounds like a nice little place. I am glad you two have that spot to share.
37089,at least Riley passed in their sleep. Hopefully they didn't suffer. i'm sorry you lost a loved one.
37090,i have a big doofy mutt who is a 75 lb lap dog in his heart. i know the feeling
37091,I absolutely agree. I really hope he doesn't win in 2020.
37092,He's like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!
37093,"Dang, that sucks. MAybe they can visit you instead?"
37094,"Ah, gotcha. Well I hope you heal fast!"
37095,I guess you don't live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!
37096,"Well, if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often it's family dynamics that are *more* challenging -- and not so easily taken care of. ;-)"
37097,That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.
37098,There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn't happen to you too much in the future!! :)
37099,I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?
37100,"That sucks, I hope you get it figured out!"
37101,"wow, it must have been quite an experience"
37102,My prayers are with you buddy. Stay safe
37103,Awesome. What breed did you own?
37104,"I love paints, and growing up we had 2 quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping."
37105,10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire. I do not think I could change a tire own my own. 
37106,"Practice makes perfect, or makes you fast in your case."
37107,I would be too! Did you to it?
37108,So did you regret doing it? Or were you super proud that you did? 
37109,You must be so proud!
37110,"I don't think you're being selfish, you're doing your best!"
37111,What state are you going to move to?
37112,"Oh that is nice, will you be going skiing?"
37113,Who doesn't..  everyone should do it!  Have you ever had any mystic experiences while you did it?
37114,I hear you can travel to different dimensions while meditating..
37115,It must have being terrifying!
37116,Tnank god! They should have let you know they where going to do the job.
37117,That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.
37118,I don't understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!
37119,"oh, that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?"
37120,Better living through chemistry! I'm glad you made it through.
37121,That is really nice of him.  Did the other people get mad because they had to wait?
37122,Lucky you.  Where I live people are not so nice.  Can I move there?
37123,I am in Central FL... so uhh.
37124,"Ouch, I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there."
37125,"Hmm, wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!"
37126,But at least you lucked out and they brought it back!
37127,"Ah, I know what you mean! And remember *yearning* to be older?! (And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads, thinking the way we are now ;-))"
37128,"As long as you keep your playful spirit, you're in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness, but I can see it in you!"
37129,It's awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do. What do you do?
37130,"That sounds like a lot of fun, it's so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people. You really seem motivating and inspiring, so I'm happy you have that job!"
37131,What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?
37132,"Silver linings do happen, maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you."
37133,Maybe not a true friend after all.
37134,I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!
37135,"That's a lot of money, to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off, or perhaps she has kids to take care of?"
37136,Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?
37137,Well done! You should be proud.
37138,"If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right?"
37139,"Wow, that's fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?"
37140,What did they or the person do to you?
37141,"Broom would be a good choice, hit them in the crotch, that will stop them."
37142,That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?
37143,"No, I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However, I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate."
37144,Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?
37145,I know you probably feel like you did a bad job- but I bet you did so much better than you think! Be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!
37146,Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there.
37147,Going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast. Especially in the fast lane!
37148,That awesome! Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself!
37149,"Yes, I have! It's a great feeling when all of your hard work pays off! Best of luck to you!"
37150,There is a big storm coming where I am living now. Did your power go out?
37151,Oh I will. Also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!
37152,"I know!  I was just watching his show on Netflix!  So sad, especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind."
37153,I agree.  He had so much to live for.  I guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside.
37154,That is good. Did you have a good time with your supervisor?
37155,Good job! Maybe you will get a promotion too!
37156,Which way are you feeling? Are you a thrill seeker?
37157,Yeah I really like Six Flags. They have some great roller coasters. Have fun tomorrow!
37158,Keep it up. Soon you'll have enough money to buy a new house.
37159,"Exactly, it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected."
37160,That's fun. Will anybody be dressing as Santa?
37161,Maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as Santa! And all the kiddies will be amazed!
37162,that happened to me one. i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once. it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home.
37163,oh no. right now you are going crazy but it will be funny like you said in the future.
37164,What types of tv shows do you like to watch?
37165,Do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?
37166,Ive been to Busch Gardens before.  They have some really cool Roller coasters.  I hope you have a great time.
37167,Ive been to the one in Tampa.  They have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around. It was equal parts fun and scary.
37168,"Yea, I agree. Or they just really don't care."
37169,Did he even hesitate?
37170,What a little monster!
37171,Dogs are the best. are they ok?  what kind of medicine do you have to give them?
37172,Awww golden retrievers are adorable.  My ex had one of them.  Well I hope your dogs feel better soon.  Ear infections are no fun at all.
37173,That's intense! I hope the damage wasn't all that bad.
37174,"Yes, get it fixed as soon as possible. Does insurance cover it?"
37175,"Wow, you remember your friends from grade school? Maybe if I saw them again those memories would come back."
37176,"Well, I hope you had a really great time. It sounds like you probably did!"
37177,"That sounds like fun, do you have a big family?"
37178,"Yes I understand, I have a big family so it's hard for us to all get together at the same time."
37179,Ive never been to one of those.  Is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?
37180,thats awesome.  I wish I would have taken dancing lessons when I was younger.  Im a horrible dancer
37181,yea you're right.  Maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot
37182,"Aw, that's so nice of him! Does he live far away?"
37183,That's a great son. It's always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed
37184,"Yeah I have had that experience. One was so bad I left before getting another job. Don't recommend doing that, lol."
37185,Stick it out until you have a backup. Your bank account will thank you!
37186,Gross. It would have gone straight into the trash here.
37187,You can use baking soda to get the smell out of it.
37188,That sounds wonderful! What type of store is it?
37189,I love that! It must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store. Do you help out or work there?
37190,I'm sure she *loves* having both your presence and your support!
37191,"Wow, I can't imagine how you felt living in Hong Kong. That would take some serious adapting."
37192,"I am so happy that you found that expat community. I have often thought about moving abroad, and I'm glad that you adapted well."
37193,"I think I might. It sound exciting, and I thank you for the encouragement."
37194,"That's unfortunate, but I'm happy that you have a good support network to help you out."
37195,I hope you recover well and I'm sure you will with good support by your side.
37196,I completely understand that. Did something like that happen recently? 
37197,"Yes, I know how you feel. All we can do is encourage friends to join us in helping to make a difference. I believe there is hope!"
37198,"Wow, that's a good amount of time. Is he usually so secretive?"
37199,"Ah, maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone. "
37200,It should be harder to get a license than it is.
37201,It's as if some people think they are the only one's on the road.
37202,"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. May I ask how long ago it was that she passed? "
37203,They probably still just need some time. My grandfather still isn't over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago. I would just make sure to keep seeing and talking to your parents to make them feel as loved as you can.
37204,Please don't ever give up. I would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places.
37205,"Go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can. I think it's great that you're trying to find other ways of making money too. You are a go-getter, and don't ever give up!!"
37206,That is awesome. Do you know what she wants to study?
37207,As long as it is something she enjoys. I am sure you are very proud of her!
37208,"it has been really busy even for me at work , i feel your pain"
37209,I know right ? unfortunately for us those are the perks of growing up lol
37210,Oh I don't think I could do that. I have a fear of falling from high places. 
37211,I think I would pass out from fear lol.
37212,I think the chances I take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions.
37213,That is interesting. Do you miss meat or dairy at all?
37214,That is good to hear. I wish you the best of luck with your new diet.
37215,I have to trust my doc completely that he has steady hands and will inject the nerve correctly.
37216,That's terrible to hear. Were you eventually able to be there?
37217,That's great news. I don't know what I would do if my mom passed.
37218,Me too. I'm glad everytihng worked out in the end for you.
37219,Not very often. She lives about 7 hours away driving time.
37220,"Those cars are pretty slick, what color was it?"
37221,"Wow, one day I hope to have enough money for a car like that, that's awesome"
37222,UGH my dog has destroyed all of my favorite shoes.
37223,I dont really like dogs for that reason.  They are fun to pet but taking care of them is a chore.
37224,That sounds like you have a great wife.  What did she make you?
37225,"Yummy, You are making me hungry.  Happy belated birthday!"
37226,I always love pizza!
37227,"when that happened to me i watched a lot of movies , for some reason the sad movies made me cry, but just be strong and patient one day you realize you can do better or find someone new"
37228,"it happens to the best of us, and i totally understand where your coming from , spend some time with your friends or loved ones "
37229,What did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa.
37230,That sounds so delicious I would have loved a plate of that food any deserts 
37231,Congratulations! Sounds like you're ready for the new position.
37232,What is your work area?
37233,"That is so exciting! Such a fun time in life to watch them discover new things and always be such a surprise with what you didn't know that they already knew! ha ha, that's a tongue twister."
37234,I do!  An 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son.  They are my life as well so I totally get what you're saying.  How old is your daughter?
37235,"Oh wow, I hope you have fun"
37236,Happy Birthday!!!!  Did you have a nice time?
37237,I love sushi.  Did you get a spicy Tuna Roll?
37238,Sounds good.  You have some generous parents.
37239,"Very nice, wind in your hair, exercise, and fresh air.  Did you have a good time?"
37240,"I am actually home bound, but I love to live through other peoples experiences.  My wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures.  I love it!"
37241,I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do you have family nearby at all? I often feel lonely when I'm watching a movie by myself but then I remind myself that I'm loved by a lot of people.
37242,"You are so strong!  Please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support, no matter the miles between you.  Take care of yourself and get out with friends when you can!"
37243,You sound like you're embracing life!
37244,Where did you move to?  I feel you. I am in the same place.  Just reversed 13 years of Lupus suffering by going plant based and now I want to live and see the world! I would love to move to Italy.
37245,"Oh wow, I'd be really jealous of him."
37246,"Well, hopefully you can get yourself a better car soon."
37247,"I have one younger brother but he is old enough to drive on his own,"
37248,Its always nice to catch up
37249,I hope you keep doing thaty
37250,"Same here. I actually moved to the other side of the USA, and I do miss my home"
37251,Not as often as I would like. Air travel is expensive after all. I know exactly what you mean though!
37252,"Were you happy about that, or creeped out?"
37253,You're a good guy. Did she take it well?
37254,That's really awesome that you supported your friend!
37255,I'm sure he really appreciated you support too!
37256,"Aw, I'm sorry. I know this isn't the best solution, but have you considered listening to funny podcasts?"
37257,"No problem! I know you can't always fix everything, but it's worth trying wierd ideas every now and then"
37258,"Oh wow, I love that kind of sauce"
37259,That isnt long at all
37260,It is always good to keep our skills up to date. We never know. It could also help for a promotion also.
37261,I hope you get your promotion.
37262,"Oh man, your life is about to get so much more hectic. I feel for you. When my first was born, I was just as pumped, full of naivety and positivity. I felt like I could take on anything coming my way. I was exhausted after two weeks. It's such a long ride until they're able to even remotely look after themselves."
37263,"I know you have a lot of work ahead of you, but I'm sure it will be a rewarding feeling that will be unmatched for the rest of your life. As a man, I can't imagine what you'll have to go through, or what you will enjoy, but I really commend all women everywhere for the strength they give when having a child."
37264,Did it scare you?
37265,"Yes, a little bit. When I was young, I didn't like that much scary movies."
37266,"Well for me, in the NFL I like the Cowboys and college its Alabama too."
37267,That's pretty cool. I bet it's pretty difficult to do something like that.
37268,"I'd love to watch people do tricks like this in person myself, but I'm not sure if there's any locations near me."
37269,Aw I am sorry that happened to you. I hope the repair didn't cost you too much! 
37270,"Ah I see. Something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up, so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours. "
37271,Well at least you put in the effort. What grade did you end up receiving on this test?
37272,That's great! Hard work pays off I guess.
37273,Oh I'm sorry.  How are his family doing?
37274,It's pretty hard to deal with.  One of my friend's buddies died in a car crash as well.
37275,"Woah, that is huge news. How are you handling the news."
37276,I am happy to hear that you will be ok. Enjoy having no kids while you can!
37277,That does not sound fun. What did you do to prepare. 
37278,That is very smart thinking!
37279,"How old were you? If you were a kid, that deserves a pass!"
37280,"You live and you learn, at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!"
37281,"That's sweet of you, the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through. You sound like a good friend!"
37282,"That's good, at least he is getting better, he'll survive!"
37283,There's nothing wrong with that
37284,You should celebrate too. I would
37285,That is always disappointing. Did you have a good time with your friends anyway?
37286,Sounds like you guys know how to have fun no matter what. You have good friends. 
37287,I too feel the same. What did happen at last?
37288,"Yeah, very good to hear! congrats!"
37289,"Eww, I hate neighbors that have no class."
37290,Maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out.
37291,How awful! Please tell me you can laugh a little about it now?
37292,Embarrassing things happen to all of us!
37293,Amazing! I wish I could see a pic of it!
37294,"Oh he will be, but enjoy it, only babies once"
37295,that's a pretty long date! Where did you guys go?
37296,That sounds like a fun day! My wife and i used to go to movies a lot!
37297,That's terrible.  Was he already very sick?
37298,Im sorry he went through that.
37299,Those were the days right. I loved those paychecks no bills.... can we go back to that? 
37300,Yeah and I bet it was like a whole 100 or 200 bucks and we were probably feeling like a ceo. 
37301,How does that make you feel? Is that a dealbreaker
37302,"Ah, I guess you have to save money somewhere"
37303,"Oh no I am sorry to hear about that, were you together long?"
37304,That's good make yourself available and open for others and you will find the next relationship
37305,"That is embarassing, but a good story at least!"
37306,"That is for sure, you can always count on parents for that"
37307,IT does go fast. I was just changing my daughters diaper and now she is in junior high!
37308,I miss being called mommy. One day you'll be called grandma
37309,"that is embarassing, but were you at least okay?"
37310,Well maybe they found that endearing in a way!
37311,How old were you when you did it?
37312,That was nice to repay them back with dinner
37313,i'm sorry to hear that. i know exactly what you are going through. My brother tragically passed away 2.5 years ago. He was only 32
37314,I know how hard it was for you. My parents and my brother lived in a different country so i couldn't even go there at that time to be with them. I felt heartbroken and alone
37315,To thank whom?
37316,Is that who got you the job?
37317,What job do you have?
37318,Are you in a union?
37319,did you find it ?
37320,well thats good
37321,how old did you turn ?
37322,When will you be able to visit?
37323,"Oh boy, that must be amazing for him"
37324,what did you end up watching instead
37325,"Oh yeah, that's always nice. Sometimes they just don't get it, though."
37326,"Wow, you sound pretty confident! You must really know what you're talking about."
37327,I am afraid to fly too.
37328,"I know right, planes make me nervous."
37329,Uh oh. I bet she wasn't happy when she found out.
37330,"Yeah, I can understand that.... But it probably would have been best to invite her anyway, just in case."
37331,that is awesome. sundays are usually my veg out days.
37332,mine is going crazy with mosquitos
37333,i tried to trim my tomato leaves yesterday but i got bit up so bad i ran back inside
37334,What does your husband do for work?
37335,"My uncle use to be an iron worker, so I know exactly what you are talking about."
37336,That is VERY understandable. Emotional affair is still a betrayal. 
37337,Well it's nice he is kind but yes that is a little strange. Women can usually take that as something and try to get with your man. 
37338,What is her best talent?
37339,Does she draw or paint? How any students are in this program?
37340,That is terrible.  I don't know why teenage boys can be so mean.  What did you end up doing?
37341,"That's good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids.  It is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a 10 year old.  No excuse for that.  I hope you don't have to deal with it again, though."
37342,"I'm sorry, what is his job?"
37343,Hopefully they will give him a better shift.
37344,Hey that's awesome!!!  What are you planning to buy with it?
37345,"That's an awesome, very adult thing to do!  Congrats!"
37346,I don't like them either. It makes me sick.
37347,Oh my gosh! That is disgusting!
37348,What does your husband do for a job?
37349,You already told me that. Is he in sales or something similar?
37350,that is no good! you need someone to be there and take care of you.
37351,"I have never been married, so i cant imagine,  but I would want to be with my spouse every moment of every day."
37352,It is so hard and so rewarding to see them grow up. 
37353,"I bet.  I really want to hold on to mine forever, but I know that they need to grow up.  I hope you are still able to make memories with yours even as they are getting older."
37354,That is pretty scary. Did you find out where it came from?
37355,Smart move. You don't want to get involved in a gunfight. Glad you made it out safely.
37356,So sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did it happen?
37357,How sad.. Feel better knowing that he is in a better place now buddy
37358,Wow. Congratulations! Is your new job near home?
37359,"Oh, that's awful. What did you do? I would've dumped her and beat that dude's face in."
37360,"Well, I gave you the solution right there, buckaroo. All ya gotta do is execute."
37361,Oh nice. did you have a good time?
37362,"Aww, that is really sweet to hear"
37363,I don't have a normal job anymore but that would frustrate me as well.
37364,What a disgusting person. I'm just being honest.
37365,Oh the broadway musical? I heard really good reviews of it
37366,"Oh yeah, he is such a true genius of our times, he deserves it"
37367,Oh.. Were you sick?
37368,"Don't feel bad about it buddy, this happens to all of us sometime. Feel better"
37369,Oh dang. How do you think that is going to go down?
37370,I'm sure everything will be fine. Just gotta be yourself!
37371,Oh no.. That should have sucked for you. what did you do?
37372,"As you should. It will pass away, dont worry"
37373,I'm so sorry but what a joyous occasion. 
37374,So happy for you. Is this your first grandchild?
37375,That sounds like a great place to propose! How did it go?
37376,That's so heartwarming! I hope your relationship works out very well!
37377,That is nice to have a friendly boss.
37378,I envy you. That is cool.
37379,Yes I did that too
37380,This happened to me also.
37381,Did you try to exercise?
37382,That is so exciting!! buying a house can be such a great experience.
37383,Oh so it is brand new.  I bet you cant wait to move in.
37384,I know how you feel. I'm working right now :(
37385,"Can you blame her?   I mean, if i didn't have bills that's what I'd be doing."
37386,Isn't that the best!  My 3 year old the same thing!  I couldn't be happier or more proud!
37387,She may be a natural artist!
37388,I see.. did they complete them?
37389,"Well, we were kids once too.. We can understand their point of view as well. Glad you got to spend quality time with them though"
37390,Thats really cool! i hope you get one very soon buddy
37391,"Yeah, i can understand how that can be frustrating. Dont worry, things will fall in its place soon enough"
37392,"awh memories, what were they of? "
37393,"so cute, i love those memories i bet it was beautiful. "
37394,Why did he leave you?
37395,"That's awful and there has to be another reason for it. I can't stand fathers who behave that way, despicable. "
37396,"Congratulations on getting an interview.  Good job in prepping for it, I'm sure you'll do well."
37397,Oh! Was the ice cream cake for you?
37398,Awww that is kind of disappointing. Ice cream cake sounds tastier than pineapple cake.
37399,Oh im so sorry to hear that.. how long were you married?
37400,It must have felt unbelievably hurtful for you.. I hope you find someone very soon..
37401,I can understand that. I don't get nearly as many birthday wishes as I used to. I guess it happens as we get older.
37402,I agree. I think they think we don't care about our birthday so they don't care either. But they are wrong.
37403,Oh! I am so happy for you. Congratulations. What was the job?
37404,That sounds very interesting. I'm sure you will do great. 
37405,What happened??
37406,Holy moly! That would have scared me too! Did you kill it?
37407,That is understandable.  Such an experience can be tramatic.  Did you eventually learn?
37408,"My wife had a similar experience, she still doesn't drive.  Good for you for overcoming it."
37409,That sounds miserable!  Did you do it yourself?
37410,At least you saved money doing it yourself!
37411,Oh wow! that stinks. Im sorry
37412,I bet it was. At least its over now 
37413,I bet.  I was the same way.  How did you guys meet?
37414,Nice.  That's a relatively unique way to meet.  What store?
37415,I would be furious.  What did you do?
37416,What was the outcome?  Did the professor believe you?
37417,That's awesome!  What kind of house is it?
37418,"That's gonna be a lot of fun, but a lot of work.  Good luck!"
37419,that is exciting! what kind of car?
37420,"wow, that is impressive. i've always liked mustangs. what color?"
37421,I've had pets to do that too.
37422,"Well, I guess it really loves you."
37423,I bet! Im sorry you are feeling down.
37424,Times like that would be so awesome! I hope they come back for you
37425,A spelling bee - what fun! I'm sure you will win - I bet you've worked hard toward your goal.
37426,"That's a lot of studying. Well, the best of luck to you, though I know you won't need it after all that hard work!"
37427,"Thats one way to get them. being a ""big girl"" is such an accomplishment"
37428,Do you guys get to talk a lot?
37429,Getting through it can only make your relationshipi stronger though
37430,Was he sick before?
37431,You must be really excited!
37432,Are you planning something special when she comes home?
37433,"I am sorry to hear that, they frighten me as well."
37434,"Yes, those scare me to death when they come out of nowhere."
37435,"Great, where will you be going?"
37436,"Well, that will be fantastic. Hope you have a good time."
37437,Cool beans. Where was she?
37438,Did you get to visit? Germany is quite beautiful.
37439,Where is it gonna be at?
37440,Is someone important coming voer?
37441,which one was it
37442,it wasn't that scary to me
37443,Aww. Thats nnice
37444,No one writes letters anymore... its kind of sad
37445,That would definitely creep me out.
37446,I have done that before lol
37447,i bet she's a wonderful woman
37448,hold on to her
37449,oh no is it completely destroyed not salvagable ?
37450,so sorry to hear about this disaster
37451,Congratulations!  Don't be too nervous!  You must have done something right to get the job in the first place!
37452,That is natural.  I'm sure you will do great!
37453,Well that's good.
37454,"Wow, i bet you miss her so much. My wife is going overseas with our son and they will be gone for 1 month! I know i will be miserable without them"
37455,I will play PubG after work to keep me busy lol
37456,Well it will be over soon
37457,I bet you are. I definitely woudl be
37458,What has you so nervous?
37459,Have you considered taking a weekend trip there to see how you like it?
37460,"Did it leave you to do it alone, or were there others ?"
37461,I see how that would be frustrating.
37462,I've heard about this movie but i've never had a chance to watch it
37463,"Aliens? I didn't think it was about aliens, i thought it's about ghosts and stuff"
37464,Well I wouldn't know lol
37465,I don't have any sharing friends either lol. You're lucky
37466,What kind of food?
37467,"Oh, disgusting."
37468,Did you start training him when he was young?
37469,That's awesome. I love a well trained dog.
37470,"I know lots of bad dog parents. I've got a well trained dog too so, I understand."
37471,"Oh thats good for your friend, but it sounds like you really would like to live there! I can imagine feeling jealous"
37472,You will get there! I would just be happy and supportive of your friend and visit often!
37473,"Oh no, did you find a backup caterer"
37474,"Of course, the wedding can be the most stressful event of your life"
37475,i like to call them deadbeats
37476,what do you collect for ? credit cards or utilities ?
37477,Oh I just did that recently. I just got back from 2 months. It will be a fantastic time.
37478,I went to Thailand and Vietnam. Dont worry about anything. Traveling was so easy and people are nice everywhere.
37479,"Oh wow, I would of been terrified!"
37480,Was it a large amount?
37481,That's rough. I'm sorry that must put you in a real bind.
37482,Congradulations on being prepared.
37483,It reallyi s the best way to do things. That way even if you forget something you've got time to remember and remedy the situation
37484,"Haha, sometimes wifes are nice to have around."
37485,That sounds lovely. Did yall make it a special day to remember?
37486,That sounds fantastic. Im sure you guys will remember that day for a while. What a nice surprise.
37487,why you should feel bad.. i am not getting you my friend
37488,oh.. you must be sweet then.. your wife is lucky
37489,What movie was it ?
37490,The worst a movie has gotten me was Event Horizon.
37491,wow lol I didn't know you can track ovulation. Good luck with getting pregannt
37492,"please don't lol i'm a man, I appreciate what you women go through when you're pregnant or on your period but i'm okay with not knowing details"
37493,Its the worse having to wait for something you really want. 
37494,Oh nice. Make a nice lunch to keep yourself busy. The delivery will be there in no time if you keep yourself busy.
37495,Yes I agree. I did have a good relationship with my m other in law but recently it changed.
37496,Mine has been around 7 years and it's been a little rocky.
37497,Oh no. Is he responsible with school or a job?
37498,"I understand, he will learn though once he gets a job and has to pay bills that he will want to go to sleep at a decent time!"
37499,Did you have a bunch of people show up there at the party?
37500,That's a great job! Well done!
37501,"Yeah, she seems like a great woman, you're lucky to have her."
37502,"You should take her on a vacation, or something. She deserves it."
37503,At least you can handle those. I can't do any of those
37504,"Well, they would probably be the same if they were in your shoes"
37505,Understandable.  What was the reason?
37506,Did you explain it to them.  That's a pretty good reason to miss it.
37507,"Sure, that makes sense."
37508,How's your relationship now ?
37509,Oh cool! What movie are you going to see?
37510,Oh awesome! It's a new one?
37511,that's extremely sweet of you! you're a nice person. my wife and i made some blessing bags and we give them everytime we see homeless people
37512,"basically it's a bag with necessities. we put some water, some non perishable foods, snacks, some wipes and a little bit of money"
37513,"What a great idea, where did that come from?"
37514,"Well I need to keep that in mind, great suggestion "
37515,"Oh wow, what a long trip. How long did it take?"
37516,That is a long time to be in the car for sure.
37517,Oh well that's a plu!
37518,So where did you stop along the way?
37519,Well at least you have a plan. Are you planning to start the renovation soon?
37520,Awesome. I'm sure it's going to turn out great.
37521,I can understand that. Did it end up going ok?
37522,That's good. I'm glad everything worked out.
37523,that's good to hear! Good for you! Maybe i should go to the pool too lol 
37524,true! Do you just swim or you do some water aerobics?
37525,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever been married?
37526,I'm so sorry. It wasn't meant to be.
37527,That's such a good tune.
37528,"Yeah, it's definitely a classic. It reminds me of my childhood as well."
37529,"Maybe you just have to find a way to get him motivated, without showing anger."
37530,"Yeah, just stay positive about it, I'm sure you'll figure something out."
37531,Was it just a bad feeling you had?
37532,Maybe someone died there
37533,"Oh yeah, the buffering?  Very annoying."
37534,I hear that.  Sometimes the classics are impossible to find.
37535,Did you get her something special?
37536,"Oh awesome, That is great!"
37537,You wont know an answer if you dont ask
37538,Just play it safe
37539,"That sucks, after going all that way too and you didn't even get to try it. I'm sorry."
37540,I hope you do get to try it soon. Be sure to let me know how it is!
37541,Wonder if it has to do with his diet?
37542,Will he be back soon?
37543,"Okay, I see. That must be hard."
37544,I think we've all done a version of that.
37545,"ha, that's too funny."
37546,That sounds tough :-(  does he get back soon?
37547,What was going on with her?
37548,"That sounds pretty serious, glad she is okay now!"
37549,What sort of issues?
37550,Cats are always getting into things and causing destruction.
37551,"Oh no, could you ask your supervisor for guidance?"
37552,Sounds like you have a good plan. I wish you the best
37553,That was very sweet. What movie did you want to watch?
37554,Oh ok! The gift was a good idea so that you ca watch it as much as you want'
37555,So you covered him. It was very noble from your side to act in this way
37556,"Well, at least you did something good for that co-worker and most probably he feels indebted toward you"
37557,So you have to wait a week longer to see her again? That stinks.
37558,"Yeah, I can imagine. At least it's only one week!"
37559,Great to hear that.I hope you enjoy your new life.
37560,I am sure you will create a beautiful house.
37561,Oh I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had it since it was a kitten?
37562,That is so sad. I had a dog die unexpectedly and it tore me up.
37563,Yeah I understand.  Are there any charities nearby that you could volunteer for?
37564,Well that's good of you.  Do you think homelessness is due to mental incapacities?
37565,Why did he do that?
37566,"Oh my, did you have a good time?"
37567,I don't understand that either. It really makes you sick to think about. Have you experienced this?
37568,No I have not. I would never participate in that either. My wife and I are extremely happy together.
37569,It always seems to work out like that doesn't it?
37570,I may have to check that out as well.
37571,"Yes, but they also bring about a lot of good changes as well."
37572,"Yes, the first years of a baby's life, the mother pretty much spends entirely with them. The husband is kind of left out in the cold."
37573,That is wonderful! Moms are truly a gift! I miss my Mom at times. We are workcamping in the mountains of NM and my Mom lives in TX.
37574,"We have always moved frequently with my husbands job but my parents usually end up following us lol. Now that we are fulltime RVers, they dont follow. I miss that sometimes. I am glad you have your Mom close! Cherish those times!!"
37575,"Wow, yes, I always feel the same way! I would love to pass of grocery shopping to someone else."
37576,"I bet. I live about 20 minutes from a real town, which is far enough for me."
37577,Omg that sounds like so much fun!!!!! Orlando? 
37578,You are going to love it 
37579,That's great. Takes a lot of dedication to be that prepared.
37580,"You should be, not everyone can really be that dedicated about something."
37581,What did they do this time?
37582,Well that is very nice of them to do!
37583,I am sure hes doing it to take care of you guys and I am sure you are pampering him too for doing it. 
37584,"Pamper him all the way up until you get some lavish vacation! loooool Im joking, partially! Happy for you guys tho! "
37585,What will you try and do?
37586,What is your field of work?
37587,that is really cool i hope you get the job
37588,not yet but i think once i have the skill for it i will defenetly will.
37589,That would bother me as well. Have you discussed this with her?
37590,I can understand that. I actually broke up with a previous girlfriend over the same type of thing.
37591,Oh that must have been so exciting and surprising! 
37592,Did you all do some fun things while he was there?
37593,"Well, that's a real tragedy."
37594,Can you buy two next time and have one in reserve?
37595,"Wow, that must've been hard to uproot your whole life. Are you happy about the move?"
37596,That's awesome! I've been wanting to do the same actually. I hope you have a fabulous time in your new place and new job!
37597,What was the boy kid's problem?
37598,Maybe he has the crush on her?
37599,Im so sorry to hear that. Is there treatment or a cure?
37600,That sounds awful. How is he feeling?
37601,Sounds like a nice surprise! my god how beautiful. 
37602,Thats seriously one of the best presents ever. Im happy for you! 
37603,Your hard work should pay off! Any strategies?
37604,Summer semesters are difficult. I did them too. Best of luck to you!
37605,Brought back a lot of memories I guess ?
37606,Always nice to have memories of the good old days.
37607,"Wow, what an awesome proposal that must've been. And maybe a little embarrassing, lol."
37608,"Haha, sounds very sweet though. "
37609,"Oh no, what are you going to do?"
37610,"I never listen to those warnings either, but now I'll have second thoughts."
37611,Congratulations! What did you name her?
37612,How sweet! Does she know any good tricks?
37613,What?  That's awful!  How did you find out it was them? Did someone see it?
37614,Oh boy.  I would confront them kindly and tell them you'd like to reach a solution without there being a fight or problem.  Those situations are never fun. Sorry.
37615,"Thunder always keeps me up, it gets so loud sometimes! And the wind!"
37616,"Yes, I could understand how it could be very fearful. It's quite scary to be woken up that way as well."
37617,I'm so proud of you! I'll pray for your success! 
37618,It's got to be so exciting though! 
37619,That sounds lovely. Do you have many flowers?
37620,That is quite impressive! You must be very proud of your work!
37621,That was very kind of them. Did they charge you for their labor?
37622,That sounds like a good neighbor. I hope that your home was not damaged.
37623,Congratulations to you both!  What's he going to study in college?
37624,That's a great degree for the future and getting a job.  Good luck to him.
37625,"That's so awesome, I'm really jealous! I've never been either, and I'm actually saving up for a trip!"
37626,"Disney World too, I've always wanted to go! I hope you guys have a wonderful time!"
37627,I'm sorry I hope you didn't get injured
37628,lol I can imagine
37629,they are such a bad company
37630,oh yea exactly
37631,It's quite disheartening to know people jump queues
37632,I believe he will pay somehow. They call it karma :)
37633,That must have been scary.  It's always better to be safe in a situation like that.  
37634,It's great that you had an RV to stock and pack more things.  Glad to hear the storm missed you!
37635,Wow you are lucky to have someone so thoughtful. I bet you were feeling great.
37636,That is awesome. I am sure you will return the favor one day.
37637,Did you plan the anniversary?
37638,"Well, hopefully they still have a good time."
37639,oh that's great. You must be the luckiest granddad in the whole world
37640,All the best buddy enjoy the celebrations :)
37641,"Im sorry to hear that, its very hard to cope with"
37642,"It is, i feel for you! i had a relative that progressively got worse and its extremely difficult  "
37643,That's awesome! I love when people remember my birthday.
37644,How fun! I wonder how they knew.
37645,Did you study hard?
37646,Then I am sure you will do well.
37647,That is impressive! I hope he is proud too!
37648,oh that is awesome! its so nice to get money in a lumpsum
37649,"that makes it very difficult, and hard not to get your hopes up"
37650,Oh wow! I would be very angry as well! Unless it was some kind of emergency or extenuating circumstance
37651,He didn't even call to let you know whats going on?
37652,"That is a great mindset to have, and should lead to a great day!"
37653,That is a very kind thing to say! i appreciate that
37654,"That is sad to hear. Don't worry, you will find someone that is for you."
37655,It seems like that but it is not true. You have to be patient and you will find your love one day.
37656,"I would have been terrified, like need a nice strong drink type of terrified! How did it end up going?"
37657,Im glad it all went well! It seems that sometimes when you are extremely nervous it can make time pass quickly too. 
37658,I'm sad to hear that. Have you tried using social media to make new friends?
37659,Try going to the park then. You could run into someone that is into you.
37660,That is awesome! Parents are the best
37661,lol i know the feeling! and being a parent i now understnd
37662,awesome! was it hold em?
37663,"most def, i love playing hold em"
37664,I also do not like spiders. I don't even like watching Spiderman due to not liking spiders.
37665,Maybe you can go see a doctor and he can help you with your fear.
37666,The only video game I have ever played is Super Mario.
37667,"It is a classic, even my kids enjoy playing it."
37668,"thats always terrible, but congrats on the anniversary!"
37669,that makes the situation worse when your expectations are through the roof
37670,"I definitely relate to that feeling, why can't they take us with them!?"
37671,"Well, I hope she gets home soon, to make the home, a home again! :)"
37672,"It is pretty crazy how fast grow up when you get older, it seems like a couple of weeks and they are in high school"
37673,"That's definitely a factor, sometimes I forget about some of my nephews even exist."
37674,I am so sorry to hear that. No one should have to go through something like that.
37675,"I'm sure I would have done the same thing! But stay strong, many people have beaten cancer! Keep a positive attitude and stay by her side!"
37676,"that was an awesome day for me too, hard to believe it was nearly  10 years ago"
37677,agreed! its a shame growing up how fast you wanted to be an adult
37678,"Oh man, now that sucks! You gotta be careful on those wet roads. At least you're okay."
37679,Is your car still drivable?
37680,"Good thinking.  You can never be too prepared, only under prepared."
37681,Yep! or if you're house will be hit.  Many possibilities with tornadoes!
37682,oh my goodness. what a blessing
37683,it much be a huge weight off of your shoulder
37684,that is great to hear! a faithful spouse is a blessing
37685,i am sorry to hear about that! i hope everything gets better for you!
37686,"oh no, I hope you did any sustain any injury"
37687,"Yea, he will definitely get caught"
37688,that makes two of us! i am terrified of all snakes
37689,"eww thats disgusting, and makes it worse it was a poisonous snake"
37690,Ah that's terrible. I would be annoyed as well I think.
37691,"I'm sorry to here that, but life goes on and tomorrow is another day. We just have to make the best with what we are given. You'll get through this."
37692,really why is that?
37693,I think with time you will get used to it.
37694,"That is great, Why does he travel so much?"
37695,What does he do for his job?
37696,"Thats good, is it very important that this friend be there?"
37697,That makes sense! Im sure he will be there for you!
37698,There you go! I need to work on that area of my life as well.
37699,I bet you have more energy and more confidence for sure!
37700,How you been together long?
37701,Awesome. I've got you beat by 1 year. You know I just read the average couple from the time to meet to the time the ends things is 6 years. If you make it past that it will probably last for every. 
37702,You are pretty lucky!
37703,Maybe I should buy some. I never win either. Its about time
37704,"I am sorry, maybe she will share?"
37705,That is infair
37706,I hate when that happens! Especially when you have been waiting for the beach!
37707,"That's what matters most, that you had a good time and made memories!"
37708,Congratulations! I'm sure you earned it!
37709,You're welcome. I wish you the best in the new position.
37710,"Oh no! That is awful, that can mess with your mood."
37711,I can understand that!
37712,I bet that is a rough schedule.
37713,Does he get any nights off?
37714,It sounds like a great chance to start over fresh! Where are you moving to?
37715,Oh wow! How exciting! I can't wait to come visit you there so you can show me the sights!
37716,"Ugh, why do people do that? It's annoying."
37717,Do you smack the women who do it?
37718,"Yeah, they are so good! George Lucas is a genius! "
37719,Yeah me too. I prefer the first three. They are very different from the others. 
37720,You're unable to hold them in?
37721,"I'm sorry, that must be pretty rough on you!"
37722,Wow that is awesome
37723,That is a long time
37724,do you pick up after them or tell them anything?
37725,Oh i can relate i am also afraid of that
37726,haha . I remember a time i was in vegas i was scared to go on this really high ride
37727,i hope you get that call soon!
37728,"wow thats great, congrats!"
37729,"oh nice, how long are you going for ?"
37730,that sounds like a great time.
37731,I understand that! what kind of car is it?
37732,Thats pretty fancy! Does it have all the bells and whistles?
37733,"That is great! I know my sister has had help with that a lot too! It can get expensive. You know they have new clothes from target at goodwill a lot, that helps with spending "
37734,"it's like $5 for new clothes, good quality a lot. Great! Yes it is a lot to buy clothes for ever growing kids"
37735,THAT is the spirit of a true giver and the only one I would take a gift from! Great in laws!
37736,That is despicable. Did you report her to the teacher?
37737,She could drop her from the class and give her an F!
37738,Me too! Who did this to you?
37739,I understand that! When I am ready to go- I just want to hurry up and go. I hate sitting around waiting too. Maybe you should make her wait and see if she likes it. Lesson 
37740,That's so sad! Can you email them?
37741,Can you see him before he goes?
37742,"Hey, that's pretty good. Do you have any goals set for yourself?"
37743,Well I hope yours work out as well. Focusing on the goals of others probably gives you a lot of inspiration.
37744,Oh I know! I could kill people like that.
37745,And they don't have a voice of their own.
37746,Congratulations! What made it so great?
37747,"Ah, well you earned it!"
37748,oh.. congrats.. you must be happy then
37749,wow then... do you have any special plans to celebrate ?
37750,Thats very admirable of you.  How do you help her?
37751,We need more people like you in the world.  Theres always someone out there who needs a helping hand and could use a friend.
37752,I totally agree. People are too divided by their political views these days.
37753,"Everyone is always fighting over these things, it's a sad thing to see."
37754,Oh! pity about you. 
37755,Hope you had good time after your work!
37756, I am so sorry to hear that.
37757,I hope you find a new puppy love soon.
37758,I am glad to hear that!  What is happening with him?
37759,That is awesome!  I hope he got a good raise
37760,I can't imagine why people would do that. Animals are helpless.
37761,You're very empathetic then! I hate seeing animals suffer as well.
37762,"Hiking is probably a tough environment to meet people! LA is real nice, but I hear the people there aren't/"
37763,That's cool! Did you end up keeping up with them after you left?
37764,Thats sweet to have such a memory of her. Did she pass away then? 
37765,"Im so sorry, pets are like children "
37766,Teething is a hard period for babies and moms
37767,Poor baby. I remember my kids teething too. It was horrible
37768,"Ha ha, I'm sure he'll get the the hang of it eventually. It takes some children longer than others to get used to."
37769,I'm not looking forward to it when I have a kid! I can't function without a good 8 hours of sleep.
37770,How does that make you feel ?
37771,I've never left the US. I've never been north of Kentucky.
37772,"I've spent my life turning my home into where I want to be, instead of where I want to leave."
37773,That was nice. What did you have?
37774,That sounds good. I bet it was fun to hangout and eat with your friend.
37775,It is very annoying! I hate it too
37776,Some people should not be allowed to drive! We were rear ended 2 times last months! Can you believe that
37777,"That;s ok, everyone has some kinda fears that make little sense to others."
37778,"Hey, I can't sleep without socks. It's no big deal."
37779,That is really nice of you! I am sure they appreciate it
37780,They get to enjoy themselves and have a good time! :)
37781,"Oh no, did you have candles and flashlights available?"
37782,"Good thing, you have to be prepared for those situations"
37783,Oh I am so sorry. Cats can be very mischievous sometimes. 
37784,Yea I feel you. At the end of the day you cant blame the cat. It didnt do this on purpose.
37785,Man I'm sorry to hear that...I've wasted a good protein shake doing that once
37786,Oh well I was starving...I just rinsed it out with some mouthwash and ordered a big pizza lol
37787,"I use to live in an older house that had a tin roof, and I'd always love hearing the rain beat on it! Helped me sleep like a baby,."
37788,I wonder if that's a common thing? It's very relaxing.
37789,I'm sorry for that. Have you tried going to therapy?
37790,I'm so sorry but you'll get there in time.
37791,I've never gambled. What happened when you were playing video poker? And is it fun?
37792,"Wow, check out Mr. Moneybags over here! That must have been a real thrill though."
37793,"Yes, it does seem like a fun place. I would love to go to the Mardi Gras."
37794,That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I would have seen it!
37795,I'd say that'd be a real disappointment to say the least.
37796,End of friendship.
37797,I am not quite sure what you mean by that?
37798,"That's OK, It happens to the best of us!"
37799,oh that little unfair
37800,oh enjoy dude
37801,Congrats! How do you feel about it? And what is the presentation on?
37802,It's good that you worked hard on it. I hope you get a raise or a bonus for your labor!
37803,I think so.  Sometimes our friends show us sides of them that they rarely show other people.
37804,Did you make the party anyway?
37805,Wow. That is a blessing
37806,I am going to always take care of my kids like that
37807,I hate doing dishes any way
37808,Cool I just finished today
37809,Yeah we had a hard time today lol
37810,I am going to do like you next year for sure!
37811,That happens sometimes
37812,I probably wouldve cried
37813,Was it like black friday? lol
37814,Stick to your routine next time
37815,I hear ya! I am definitely shopping online
37816,plus you can usually get some kind of cash back. I love deals
37817,"Ew, I hate spiders. We are in the process of getting them out of our garage."
37818,"Oh no, throw it away!!!!"
37819,How was it too much?
37820,That sounds very strange
37821,How big is the bonus usually?
37822,"Wow, well I hope you guys get it this year then!"
37823,"Wow, good for you guys!"
37824,"That is young, I wish someone had helped you!"
37825,Math has never been my strong suit. I'm more of a history type of person.
37826,That was very altruistic of her! 
37827,Why she is doing that?
37828,Ah ok I undestand.
37829,why did you go back?
37830,"good for you, best of luck!!"
37831,Oh no. Did you have a good backup plan ?
37832,Maybe you can transfer after a bit ?
37833,I understand! I would feel the same way.
37834,What do you mean by that? I'm not a gamer really
37835,"Oh you're right, it has. I hear about it more and more"
37836,I hate that most parks close during the winter too. Do you have any indoor type amusement parks near you?
37837,I feel you. You will just have to go as often as possible during the other months to make up for the winter time without!
37838,"Ooh, congratulations! I'll be graduating soon too. What's your major?"
37839,"That's very cool. My dad's an electrical engineer, actually. I'm a cybersecurity major myself."
37840,What is your most prized posession?
37841,"Oh wow, maybe he can get a scholarship! I know some colleges now offer bowling athletic programs."
37842,"You must be very proud of him! Yes, I love to bowl with my family but I'm not very good at it!"
37843,That is scary. Do you have means of defending yourself?\
37844,Maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house! Don't hesitate to call the police if you feel you should!
37845,"Ha ha! I have done that, too. So embarrassing."
37846,"Phew, so they got most of the attention."
37847,It can be hard in those situation I know you don't want to loose a friend in the end.
37848,Yes you should but when you feel comfortable don't feel guilty you are the victim he is a sad case you got this.
37849,"Aw, that has to be tough not to see your friends. Do they visit often?"
37850,How awful! You're much better off staying at home. I hope you find new friends soon!
37851,School can be tough. How many credits are you taking on?
37852,"Engineering is already tough. If you can get through this, I'd say you'll be very successful in life."
37853,oh you're gonna be awesome i bet!
37854,"yeah that always happens, don't be hard on yourself as long you do great"
37855,Nice. What was dinner?
37856,I haven't met a pizza I didn't like yet.
37857,I remember my kids going through that. Do you have teething rings for him?
37858,Poor boy. I hope he gets through it soon.
37859,What is the game about you must love games it will take up your whole night.
37860,Really that is a cool story to tell when asked how you 2 met did ya'll play online together a lot?
37861,Oh that's not good. Do they argue about small things?
37862,"Yikes, that shouldn't be. I think you've really stepped up in this situation. Hopefully they can see that and change their ways."
37863,"I love storms too but yeah, that's a nuisance."
37864,"Yikes! Lightning didn't strike real close by, did it?"
37865,That is good. Will it be a difficult semester?
37866,That is good. I am sometime a procrastinator.
37867,"Awww, what fun.  That must have been so nostalgic for you!  I wish I was back in childhood again sometimes."
37868,"I saw a toy that they are bringing back from a couple decades ago when I was a kid and wow, it was so neat to see!"
37869,Wow. Sibling's got skills.
37870,How long has he been bowling?
37871,"I am sorry to hear that, I am sure you will be fine. What kind of job is it?"
37872,"Well, it shouldn't be too bad. If you couldn't do the work I'm sure they wouldn't have hired you."
37873,That's a bummer. At least you will be more attentive next time?
37874,"Indeed. If everyone got worked up over things like that, we'd all be out of jobs."
37875,That sounds incredible. Did you visit the Great Salt Lake?
37876,"Man, I definitely have to go there. Sounds like a great place for sightseeing."
37877,"Oh my god, Do you think he got it just because you like it so much?"
37878,"That is hilarious, In a cruel kind of way."
37879,"Ohh, I feel you. I felt the same way, when I was planning to buy a new car."
37880,Yeah. I believe you are emotionally attached to it!
37881,Wow why would they even do that?
37882,"Sheesh, people will take anything that's not nailed down these days."
37883,That's terrible to hear. Is it old?
37884,Are you thinking of getting a new car?
37885,Me too. Its nerve wrecking
37886,Maybe you should take some classes to help you with that
37887,"Ohh, cleaning dog poop is always been annoying, yet petting the dog is always amusing."
37888,Ha ha. I feel sorry for you though. No one likes to clean the dog poop!
37889,That has happened to me several times
37890,Lol. They probably just laughed about it over dinner
37891,Were you able to get them?
37892,That was so sweet of him! You're lucky to have such a sweet boyfriend
37893,Thanks you for your service
37894,Which branch?
37895,I have never had that feeling.
37896,Well thats good. Probaby saved a bunch of coins
37897,I would also cry with you!
37898,I cry at least a day!
37899,oof that sucks really bad
37900,yea i can imagine it is
37901,"That sucks, are you going to leave Texas or stay?"
37902,How much did the damage cost you?
37903,I do not even have a toilet.
37904,I use the woods!
37905,Really? Is that a promotion?
37906,Good for you.
37907,Were you afraid of heights and high speeds?
37908,I am glad you did. Rollercoasters are thrilling and should not be missed out on!
37909,oh wow! that sounds very special!!!
37910,im glad your family did that for you
37911,Oh wow! That must have been terrifying! Were they able to help her?
37912,I could imagine. It must have been amazing to see her rescued though!
37913,That sucks. Did they give you any reason why they won't verify it?
37914,"Well, I hope they can get you taken care of soon. I know I hate it when I can't get to my money I have online."
37915,I am the same.. woke up at 6 for no reason
37916,LOL i hate that
37917,I understand those kind of situation could scarry.
37918,i hate those as well
37919,I am so sorry to hear that. 
37920,I truly hope you can recover from this major loss in your life.
37921,im glad to hear that! 
37922,good luck to you! i wish you the best
37923,i think you had good skills with tools
37924,thats cool of you 
37925,Oh that's great. What are you going to be doing?
37926,"Oh wow, that sounds like a tough job, but I bet you will be good at it."
37927,"Oh, I'm sorry.  What are you thinking of getting?"
37928,Nissans are very nice and rugged.
37929,That is a great move!  I did the same thing.
37930,"Good job, keep up the good work!"
37931,What was for breakfast?
37932,You can't! Sounds like a wonderful morning!
37933,"That's awesome, it's not easy to do that so kudos to you!"
37934,I'll keep my fingers crossed that you won
37935,Oh awesome!  Congrats!!!!  How has it changed life for you?
37936,That's really fantastic!  I'm glad to hear you turned your life around.  
37937,That sounds so great. Who was the one to come up with this plan?
37938,I see. I wish I had a partner and we could go to such places together too. Maybe some day hopefully
37939,Wow! That was really nice of her! What was the occasion? You guys must be very close.
37940,That is so awesome! I am sure you appreciate her for it. It's good that you have a great relationship with her.
37941,Do they live in a different state than you?
37942,Sorry to hear that.  Remember those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind
37943,Souds like you were content.
37944,I feel you. Sometimes its nice to veg out and just watch tv.
37945,Oh no! That's awful!  I watch animals for a few different people and I would never do that.  That's very unprofessional. Did they have an emergency?
37946,That's ridiculous.  I was going to see who might have helped you.  I'm so glad your friend helped.  Hope you had a great time!
37947,What kind of dogs do you have?
37948,Do you like to watch tv with you doggies?
37949,Do you talk with her on the phone?
37950,Will you throw her a comeback party?
37951,"Oh, that's cool. Did you find any good memories in there?"
37952,Nice! It sounds like a really good bonding experience.
37953,I'm so sorry.  I know you must've felt helpless but coming from a wife's perspective; I would know my husband couldn't be right next to me but his words and love make all the difference. 
37954,I totally feel you.  My husband as gone for work so much for a couple years.  It will just be a season of life and then you'll be back together!  Communicating even more than ever and encouraging each other can help so much.  You're doing great!  I hope you're together soon!
37955,So who annoyed you?
37956,So did it result in a brawl?
37957,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he's feeling better now.
37958,He's lucky to have you there.
37959,I can understand that. Do you try to find ways to fill your time while you're waiting?
37960,"Yeah, waiting for someone can be a real pain. "
37961,I also love dogs.
37962,Puppy's are the best. I love puppies!
37963,how much did you pay for the surgery?
37964,uhmnnn! scared of your cat or the vet?
37965,"Holy hell, that must have been scary! Did you see it happen?"
37966,I'm sorry to hear that. I really hope you are able to get over this and feel at ease again!
37967,I'm so sorry!  That can be a devastating time. I have been there before.  How long did you have your dog?
37968,I completely understand.  Something that helped me was to have pictures up and also have a little remembrance each year with some other family that loved him as much as I did.  Just take it a day at a time.
37969,"Aw, I'm sorry, well I'm here to talk to you! "
37970,"I feel you.  I've been in that position, and it can get dark.  But there's always people online to talk to!"
37971,"That car is quite expensive, I wish I could afford one too."
37972,Work hard and maybe you could afford it.
37973,"That's sad, why don't you go visit them?"
37974,"That's a bummer, hopefully you can still talk to them over the  phone or online!"
37975,"that is not good, what was wrong with your food?"
37976,did you ask for a refund when you realized the problem?
37977,Why didn't you say anything?
37978,Well then I dont blame you. I would have done the same thing
37979,"That's very nice of her, family is one of the best things we have in this world."
37980,"As you should be, some people don't have anyone to lean on in their lives."
37981,that sounds spooky
37982,oh no i hope you stay safe
37983,Nice! That's a very nice surprise.  What kind of car?
37984,"Wow, she went all out, hope you drive safely and have fun with it!"
37985,I am really sorry to hear that.  Why are you ashamed?
37986,That is really too bad.  Did you all have a fight?
37987,"That's not nice of them, are they meaning to be rude?"
37988,"You should let them know you aren't ok with them doing that.  If they are real friends, they will stop."
37989,How come? what happened?
37990,Ohhhh.  Yea I would be scared too then.  That sounds terrifying.
37991,"That's good, where are they?"
37992,"Wow, did they go there on vacation?"
37993,Why would she leave you?
37994,"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. I know your heart is broken. Did you try to talk to her about it?"
37995,What movie did you want to see?
37996,Why won't you be able to watch it?
37997,Oh yeah that sounds very relaxing! I hope it was good weather for you all! 
37998,"That's great! Im glad you had a good time, its always nice to have a refresher to get away from everything for a little bit!"
37999,Oh boy! Where are you headed?
38000,Congratulations! I hope everything goes well! 
38001,"Oh, wow. Its like that sometimes. You have to give into your sweet tooth."
38002,"Ugh, I hate the regret that comes with giving into food cravings. Don't be too hard on yourself. It was just one time."
38003,how awesome. my husband is 7 years cancer free
38004,it's amazing news. congrats to you both. enjoy your time together
38005,Six months!  I would be so mad!  What are you going to do about it?
38006,Good call!  I would have done the same thing!
38007,"i think you will nail it, are you prepared"
38008,good then you will do well!
38009,"i bet, have you told them how u feel about it?"
38010,i guess just walk away is all
38011,Well you can get better
38012,"You will do better next time, I promise"
38013,I do not have those
38014,I do not attend school
38015,"I am sorry to hear that, I hope you had some time together before hand"
38016,"That is good at least, you had some closure at the worst"
38017,What did you win?
38018,"Oh that sucks.  Those are the types of situations where you can't help it, but you know you did wrong the second after it's over."
38019,"Well, there aren't any rules against apologizing to your kids?"
38020,Yeah you can judge someone like that
38021,Thats a nice gesture from you
38022,"Oh man, the beach always sounds nice"
38023,That sounds like it was lovely
38024,I am sure not many people noticed
38025,"I can imagine, sorry"
38026,I am so sorry I have been there so many times
38027,I am sorry you had to go through that
38028,What did they do
38029,"Oh well, he will learn"
38030,"You do what you want, you earn it!"
38031,Why is he not helping?
38032,"Oh, well work can be tough too sometimes"
38033,I bet you are proud
38034,I am sure she did
38035,"that is sweet, who from?"
38036,"Wow, how sweet of him, you are both lucky!"
38037,What of?
38038,"Oh, that is awesome, I love those trips down the old memory lane"
38039,"Oh wow, talk about bad timing"
38040,"Oh no, I hate flies"
38041,I'm ready for a new start for my family and a better paying job!
38042,Yes! and new opportunties for my family. We need the fresh start on life. I don't like living in Texas.
38043,"Wow, I don't know how you runners do it. I can't stand running. How many miles do you run per day on average?"
38044,"I usually jog in the backyard, but not really running. I'm too fat to run."
38045,Its always nice to get some sleep
38046,"Oh wow, that was nice of him"
38047,I am glad for you. I hope it continues
38048,"Oh nice, its good to have options"
38049,"Wow, they do grow up fast, appreciate the time you get!"
38050,"Oh no, that sounds scary"
38051,I hope they are
38052,"That is not something to take for granted, enjoy yourself!"
38053,"I hope so too, best of luck with that!"
38054,You can always start tomorrow
38055,"It can be hard, but you can do it"
38056,"I get that, best of luck friend!"
38057,They'll always have good memories of the beach.
38058,What kind of dog
38059,She does sound adorable
38060,How long did you live in your old one?
38061,It'll take some getting used to.
38062,Sounds like you practice a lot to get good.
38063,Are you the captain?
38064,Is this a common occurrence?
38065,That's good. I hope it's controllable.
38066,He sounds like a great guy. I'm glad you have fond memories of him.
38067,"She may be skinny, but it doesn't mean she's healthy."
38068,"Yea, I totally understand that. She won the genetic lottery there."
38069,Have you tried speaking with the post office?
38070,"That's ridiculous, they should have to do something."
38071,That sounds like fun. what did it bring to you?
38072,Eww... that's pretty gross. I had a cat once that would bring me dead birds too. I think that means they like you!
38073,"Watch out! Next thing you turn around, and he's driving."
38074,I hope you got some photos.
38075,That is bad. You should have got refunded.
38076,How'd that go?
38077,"Oh god, roaches. Did you guys use the bathroom anyway?"
38078,"oh my gosh, a plate! That kinda sounds serious."
38079,that is a lot.. most i ever took at one time was 5 classes and i cried at least twice that semester.
38080,Damn that is impressive congrats.. I took 1 class last semester and got an A lol
38081,That's true. Did you finish the job?
38082,That's really great. It's nice when everything works out in the end.
38083,"Oh, all the time. I've got to change my Depens three times a day."
38084,Oh wow. I just would've blamed it on whoever I was with.
38085,"Oh, I don't know why concerts make me feel a bit sentimental"
38086,That must have been horrible! I'm so sorry you went thru that
38087,"Yes, some people call it fate."
38088,That sounds so romantic!
38089,"Oh no, was it benign?"
38090,"That is so terrible, I'm so sorry."
38091,Do you dress up when the new movies come out also?
38092,"Ah, I bet seeing all of the kids now dressed up does take you back to an earlier time.  Nostalgia has a way of getting to each of us."
38093,what is a dive bar
38094,oh ok. We call them hole in the walls lol
38095,mine too.
38096,are you going to pass it down too?
38097,well thats nice
38098,Oh yeah that can be a mine field to walk across. Didn't have any issues?
38099,"That's very faithful of you, and the right thing to do I'd say. "
38100,Did a specific experience cause this? or just instinct.
38101,"Thats interesting my mother has always been afraid of heights, Not myself though."
38102,I use to go to raves when I was in high school.
38103,Did you get arrested?
38104,Why did she break up with you?
38105,Are you still friends with her?
38106,Me too! the first one I ever went to traumatized me.
38107,That seems like a weird birthday activity.
38108,Have you ever woke her up and told her to stop?
38109,"Thats hilarious, my mother snores like a monster"
38110,"Yes! thats actually amazing, you have a good friend!"
38111,You are lucky! who won?
38112,Yay! is it a family member having a baby
38113,What?!?! thats amazing! starting a family I imagine can be surreal 
38114,Oh yeah? Where are you going?
38115,That sounds like a lot of fun
38116,did you do anything special during your alone time?
38117,"that is not good, you should try to find an activity for when you are alone"
38118,"tHat is insane, I usually give myself like 2 or 3 days."
38119,"Thats right! thats such a good feeling, just breezing through a test."
38120,Where did she go?
38121,"Oh, I bet that was frustrating. Did you get evey thing squared away and taken care of?"
38122,Where are you living at?
38123,That sounds amazing
38124,That's great to hear. What made you think it went well?
38125,Those are good signs! Sounds like you hit it out of the park!
38126,Pool's always a difficult game to pick up. I'm guessing your first time went well?
38127,Wow. Talking about cleaning up.
38128,Are you still going to attend it?
38129,"Of course, but at least you can still afford it."
38130,"Yes, I agree, are you hoping for something in particular."
38131,That's a good hope. Good luck with that. 
38132,"That is great, I bet she is very proud of herself."
38133,"As you should be, so many young people give up before reaching their goals."
38134,"Me time is very crucial for anyone, it help one clear hi or her mind. We are so much alike.."
38135,"Sort of reduces stress,very crucial"
38136,Oh no! Hopefully he is ok. Did you take him to the vet?
38137,What a silly dog than! She will learn to not do that again!
38138,That's great! Congratulations! Is this your first child?
38139,"Congratulations, again. Parenthood is truly a great and wonderful experience."
38140,That's so cool of them. That's how parents should be
38141,We all need a little help sometimes
38142,"Great, where did you go?"
38143,Was it a good trip overall?
38144,"Yes, flying is very hard to do. "
38145,"Yeah, and so little you can actually care on instead of checking."
38146,Why don't you trust?
38147,He is correct. But you should trust some people whom you think they're good.
38148,Wow that sounds pretty high to me. What was wrong with it?
38149,Wow what a crook that other guy was!
38150,Congratulations! Is this your first child?
38151,I'm so happy for you. Have you two thought of a name yet?
38152,Was it any fun?
38153,"Yes, I wish flying was a bit faster."
38154,"Oh no, what did she do"
38155,"Oof, that can get messy."
38156,Congratulations! When is it due?
38157,Are you excited? Do you have a name in mind?
38158,Amazing! did you go down rapids and do scary stuff?
38159,Emerged from a bathroom? Intiguing. What do you mean?
38160,"OH - I'm sorry to hear that, but it sounds like he had a bit of character about him"
38161,It must be true love!
38162,I feel like that sometimes - but people have usually seen worse.
38163,Oh no! I bet you were terrified! 
38164,Were you guys angry or frustrated with each other?
38165,Must be such an exciting time for your family! 
38166,Be sure to get plenty of rest thought! Its easy to lose sleep in such a time.
38167,"Oh, I am so sorry. Were you also close to them?"
38168,What a sad way to go. If only he could have gotten help.
38169,Wow - hidden depths. Are you going?
38170,Amazing. Just shows that you can't judge a book by it's cover
38171,"Oh my, did it happen to you recently?"
38172,That sounds terrifying! Must have been like a nightmare for you.
38173,When did you move in?
38174,3!!! Amazing
38175,Wow that's a tough schedule. Especially with a new baby.
38176,Why were they doing that?
38177,Oh that's awesome! What was the teen asked to speak about? Are they nervous?
38178,"When I was growing up I know that my youth leader made a huge impact on me, so it's really a great thing that you do working with kids. "
38179,"try not to get so tense, that can harm your health"
38180,Take a deep breath and calm the discomfort ... that helps
38181,Cool. Pizza is my fav food. What movie you guys going to see?
38182,I love that movie also. Have fun 
38183,wow i am so proud of that
38184,was it expensive ? any student loans ?
38185,Did they give you any reason for not giving you the job?
38186,"Well, at least a candidate that deserved the job got it. "
38187,I bet. I'm not a very confrontational person so I do everything I can to avoid places like that
38188,You should bring it up to your boss at work for a security guard to accompany you next time!
38189,Did you offer to replace the broken baking dish that you accidently broke?
38190,"That sounds like a good friend, forgive and forget. She new you did not intend on breaking the baking dish."
38191,That sounds good. Are you moving soon?
38192,I hope you find something that you like and are happy with. Its really important to be happy with where you live.
38193,That is always a good feeling. Such a relief.
38194,It was nice of you to step up and help out.
38195,"Haha, I can relate to that. I did that too, and my friends took a wonderful photo of it. They like to stick it on our yearly Christmas cards to each other"
38196,"You have to :) Everyone has bad moments and if you can't laugh at them, then they just eat you up!"
38197,How exciting! That is a great accomplishment.
38198,I know how you feel. My oldest is in her sophomore year of college. 
38199,did you talk to them politely or yell back ?
38200,"what industry are you in, i find that a lot in retail and service"
38201,Why what is it that you want them to notice about you that they bypass. 
38202,"I completely understand think of it as maybe they are not meant to be apart of your life, you will find some good friends just be patient. "
38203,What is exciting to you about swimming?
38204,So you prefer a pool to an ocean?
38205,That is so sweet I love a caring husband has she gotten better?
38206,As you should a good husband is what keeps us women strong also good for you she is lucky to have you. 
38207,I feel you! What do they do for you?
38208,Its rare to have that! I have it now too. It is great to know you have someone to rely on and trust!
38209,Yikes! Was anything damaged? 
38210,That's pretty scary. I'm glad there wasn't any damage and that you're okay.
38211,"Wow, congratulations! That must have taken a lot of training and practice."
38212,"What kind of dog is she, and how long have you been competing like this?"
38213,Did you stay with other relatives?
38214,Do you Enjoy that?
38215,I bet that's kind of a pain. How are you dealing with it?
38216,I bet. It's so annoying when people show off like that.
38217,ewww did you get a refund or at least a voucher ?
38218,I would have blasted them on Yelp
38219,What about the them park made you anxious?
38220,They can be really scary for people who do not like them.
38221,Why did your friend do that to you?
38222,"I am not sure I would be able to forgive someone of something like that, it is really rude behavior."
38223,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried joining clubs or hanging out with people from work?
38224,I know how that is. 
38225,I understand how you'd feel that way. Do you trust her around other guys?
38226,Ah. That can be tough in a relationship.
38227,"I understand. Horror movies freak me out, too. Did you watch the whole thing?"
38228,I bet. I don't think I could sit through a whole one.
38229,How long ago did that happen?
38230,"I am so sorry to hear, if you need to talk to someone about it, I am here for you"
38231,she must not have loved you
38232,"people change over time, is she thinking of coming back ?"
38233,Was the weather good?
38234,"That is awesome, I am sure you can not wait to go back"
38235,Perhaps try telling the person how it makes you feel
38236,Have confidence in yourself and be stern about it.
38237,That sounds nice. How often does this usually happen?
38238,I hope this continues for you for a long time.
38239,Did you guys get to eat the cake?
38240,"its just the way the world is now, social media has ruined humanity"
38241,it can't get any better than it already is now. 
38242,Have you told them how you feel?
38243,Just sit them down and talk about the way they are treating you
38244,That must have been so annoying. Hopefully you can just get a replacement.
38245,I hope he doesnt do it again.
38246,"that is so annoying, some people just dont have morals"
38247,can you afford to move ?
38248,How does it get you into trouble?
38249,I'm sorry to hear that. I guess at least if helps you know you can trust in the future and who you can't.
38250,so proud of yourself right ?
38251,you will be making more money
38252,"I hate going to the dentist, too. You just gotta go through with it."
38253,"By now, wish it was less painful, hu?"
38254,that's cool. I wish I had my dream job
38255,My dream job is being born rich. Its too late for that
38256,ick. 
38257,Whoa that is always exciting. Baseball can be boring at times.
38258,I love sports. I am glad you got to experience that.
38259,Woot! That's great! Which brand are you thinking?
38260,Toyota is a great choice
38261,EW OMG Did you kill it?
38262,EEK! Sounds frightening!
38263,That was nice! What does Scottish cheese taste like?
38264,Cheddar is one of my favorites. I live pretty close to Cabot Creamery and I love their sharp cheddar.
38265,It's located in a small farming town in Vermont. I went on a tour of their factory once and it was interesting to see the cheese being made.
38266,"You should definitely check to see, or stop by Cabot if you ever visit Vermont."
38267,"I'm sorry to hear that, that's very sad. Were you two close?"
38268,"That's a bummer, I'm sure he is looking out for you up above!"
38269,"Ah man, that's a buzz kill, are you still going to rough it out in the rain?"
38270,"Ah dang, well there's always next weekend!"
38271,Did you have a good time visiting with them?
38272,What did you guys do?
38273,That sounds fun.  Was the weather nice?
38274,What sort of food did you eat?
38275,"It is, but I think it was all along and people are just standing up for what they believe in more now."
38276,"Maybe, but I think the best we can hope for is tolerance."
38277,"I'm very sorry to hear that.  Losing anyone close to you, especially a parent would be very hard.  Are you close to other members of your family and were you able to help each other through it?"
38278,I bet it has.  Keep sticking by with your family.  I'm sure you are all there for each other more than you know.
38279,What did you do to feel that way?
38280,"I'm sorry to hear that, you could make it up to them by going to visit?"
38281,Cool! Who are you going to see?
38282,"Of course! Grace is so talented! She was on America's Got Talent, right? I get all those reality talent shows confused."
38283,"Wow, that sounds amazing!"
38284,Great news then!
38285,How was that? Were you excited for some more quiet and for them to get back on a schedule? Or are you sad that it shows that they're getting older?
38286,"Ah, that's interesting you say that. I thought you'd just be like everyone else, who say, ""Happy to nudge them out the door!"" You sound like a good parent"
38287,What beach were you heading too?
38288,Who all went with you? That sound so fun.
38289,"That's awesome, have you ever tried surfing?"
38290,Did you win? LOL
38291,Winning those huge jackpots is always a curse.  Go for a smaller win :)
38292,That is so exciting. A little extra cash can always help.
38293,"Yes, that would be a great surprise. It can also take a lot of stress off of you."
38294,how was it
38295,You should make a wheel you can spin to decide.  I did that once.
38296,Yes you put all the places on it and spin..
38297,Put that on there too!
38298,Oh me too! Do you have a monday to Friday type job?
38299,Oh that is a pretty good schedule. I am a teacher so I'm off right now. It's wonderful. 
38300,Maybe its time for a new friend.
38301,ask him to stop being a jerk?
38302,"Oh dear, that must be difficult. Are there medications to take that will help?"
38303,"Oh, I'm really sorry. That is for sure a challenge. "
38304,I'm glad you were safe. Tornados are not a fun thing to experience.
38305,Have you only had to deal with one?
38306,"Well, that's very nice. I'm sure you were looking forward to that shopping trip."
38307,That's was so thoughtful and sweet! Seems like you are a lucky wife!
38308,That is a lot of fun.  What is your favorite holiday to drive around in?
38309,Im sorry it makes you miss your moms decor.  At least you have those memories to hang onto.
38310,That must be comforting!  It is good to have people in your life that are supportive.
38311,Don't ever take her for granted!  Make sure she knows you are thankful!
38312,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you not live close to a beach?"
38313,That must suck not living close to a beach. Hopefully you get to go back real soon.
38314,"Hah, seems we both had some luck. Good for him!"
38315,You guys should go out and celebrate! 
38316,Lucky! I would not trust anyone in my house!
38317,Oh no! That's my greatest fear that people will tell my secrets
38318,"Aw, perhaps she just slipped up? It does happen even to the best of us"
38319,Oh that can be scary. I don't watch horror movies because I know that I'll do just that!
38320,Well I'm glad you were ok! Sometimes it's not just a shadow
38321,That's the best kind of day.
38322,"Must have been so nice, what movie did you watch?"
38323,"I am so sorry to hear about Riley, I know he was an important part of the family. How is everyone holding up after the news?"
38324,Yes that is true. You know there is peace in another place. He will always be remembered.
38325,I can empathize with you there.  Do you think there might be another way to let her know? 
38326,"Well money is not everything, one day it will come out and then the timing will likely be worse."
38327,Really!  Good for you!  Are you excited to start or nervous?
38328,"It's OK to be nervous, but don't let it stop you!  No risk, no reward!"
38329,"That sucks, I work with people like that and it's just more work for other people"
38330,"That's horrible, you should tell the boss and get her fired"
38331,"I bet it was.  Death is never an easy thing to deal with, especially for a child."
38332,I hope she will be alright!  I remember how devastated I was when my last dog passed away and I was an adult.  A kids emotions seem to amplify everything! 
38333,You are lucky!
38334,how much did you win?
38335,I have never won that much. Congratulations
38336,"Oh geez, thats terrible!  Did they run from the scene?  Hopefully they left some information.  I was in a hit and run about 4 months after I bought my new car and I felt sick that it was already hit."
38337,Wow. Do think he had bad intentions?
38338,Oh man...I hate checking the mail..it could be something crappy
38339,Oh god- Do you live in the country?
38340,"Then the person might be caught, do you have a camera? That is really crappy of someone! I have seen people put metal or wood pallets next to their mailboxes because of people doing stuff like this"
38341,"It's a good idea to have one just in case. Murders, robberies etc happen even in small/nice towns. Just for your safety "
38342,That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?
38343,That is a shame.  At least she made a stopover!
38344,What's the exam on?
38345,I wish you good luck!
38346,That's really cool! Was it your first game ever?
38347,Well I think it really cool that you were able to get back into something that you used to do when you were younger!
38348,That's so interesting because I saw someone post the same thing on a neighborhood app just today.  Is that you? ha ha.
38349,"Ha ha, guess you weren't the one.  That would've been crazy!  I hope its okay!  I'm sure someone will try to grab it."
38350,"oh my goodness thats terrible, i am so sorry!"
38351,i can imagine! my dad is my best friend i would be devasted
38352,Hey I like alone time!  Just gotta find some cool stuff to do!
38353,oh no!!  The ghosts are coming!! Yeah turn the TV up LOUD :D
38354,Holy cow that's awesome!!!  What are you going to do with all that extra moneys??
38355,That's pretty cool!  Congrats!!
38356,I am so amazed by her! 
38357,theres always tomorrow!
38358,That's really creepy.
38359,"Also some kind of sound alert. You think you could scream for help during those times, but a lot of people actually don't."
38360,is that a good show? i have never heard of it
38361,nice! what channel?
38362,That does sound like a great night! I think I'm overdue for one of those myself!
38363,That's great. It's nice when we get some peaceful time for ourselves.
38364,That is a big change!  Are you moving due to a job or something like that?
38365,"Yes, that is definitely a big change.  I hope you settle in quickly though - change like that can be a drastic lifestyle upheaval, but it could also be the best thing ever!"
38366,Nice. Do you like your new neighborhood?
38367,That is great. Why did you move?
38368,I'm not a fan of doctors most of the time - how did it go?
38369,I cannot stand that - they should not schedule people so close together if they can't handle that pace.
38370,Aww - did you feed the cat?
38371,That's how we have our cat also - how funny!  They are just irrestible at some point aren't they?
38372,Ugh!  I'm assuming that it woke you up?
38373,Oh my goodness!!  How irritating!  I hope they didn't call back?
38374,No way! Congrats! I'm having twins sometime this coming week
38375,That's nice! Kids are great
38376,I've always loved Halloween! Some people get crazy creative!
38377,"That's awesome! Now that I have kids, I have even more of an excuse to go out and check out what creative ideas people have every year."
38378,Oh no!  I can't even imagine that - was everyone ok?
38379,I'm so glad that everyone was ok.  But I know that was devastating - did you rebuild?
38380,scary! how long were you lost for?
38381,oh good... I was imagining days
38382,Do you think she will be a good teacher for your daughter?
38383,A good teacher makes a huge difference in how well the child learns and how much influence the parents are allowed to have - I hope your daughter has a great year.
38384,I just cannot watch horror movies!!  Did you like it?
38385,Oh I am right there with you!  The last scary movie I watched made it where I couldn't sleep that night.
38386,Oh yeah?  Do you still look awesome like you did back then?
38387,Yeah I bet.  Do you still keep in touch with any of them?
38388,Yeah.  Maybe you should hit them up on FB for a reunion?
38389,I bet you all would live it up and have a blast!
38390,"What did he want?  It's kinda scary when that happens, you never know what they want."
38391,"Well a good samaritan after all!  I'm sure you were embarrassed, but also glad that you didn't lose your purse!"
38392,Nice! What kind of car is it?
38393,Well deserved! I hope she enjoys it to the fullest!
38394,Hey that's awesome!  Where ya goin?
38395,Holy cow that's awesome!  That's gonna be a fun 10 days!
38396,Cool!  Have fun and be safe!!
38397,That's a nice getaway
38398,Have fun!!!!
38399,yikes that is pretty horrible
38400,just seems so inappropriate and disgusting
38401,"Oh wow, I hope you cherished your time with him."
38402,"Sorry that that happened to you, I hope you're doing well."
38403,What did you do with the money/
38404,That is smart. How often do you play the lottery/
38405,k
38406,That is great. Where is the award displayed?
38407,Cool. Will you leave it there forever?
38408,Did you get mad at her?
38409,Hopefully she won't do it again.
38410,That was very nice of you.
38411,That is showing the Christmas spirit.
38412,He probably forgot about it already.
38413,You must of been hard working.
38414,That is great news. Congrats.
38415,Oh no!  I bet that was embarassing :(
38416,I'm glad you're okay.  Did you have the baby yet??
38417,Do you not have friends?
38418,"True, but better than nothing."
38419,oh man well at least its a good thing to see them grow
38420,thats fair enough
38421,Wow that's impressive!
38422,That's what I thought when I did it but I got a 34.
38423,Where did he take you to?
38424,I love Tunica. Did you win at blackjack?
38425,Oh no. hy did you do it?
38426,Did she find out?
38427,Why wasn't it good? Florida sounds like an ideal destination.
38428,"I know what you mean but hey like you said, it was free."
38429,"Awesome, are you a millionaire now?"
38430,At least you won something though. I've never won anything from the lottery.
38431,I know how that feels. Maybe try reaching out.
38432,SOmetimes you have to be the bigger person
38433,Dang that's really annoying.  Is your insurance going to cover it?
38434,Yeah dealing with an accident is one of the most aggravating things.
38435,"trust your god feeling, everything will be alright"
38436,Did you buy all the essential items the dog will need? 
38437,Nice! Are you married?
38438,"I am forever alone. However, I hope you continue to have great relationships and a great life!"
38439,Wow! What was it?
38440,I'd like to see this vase. Do you like flowers?
38441,what did you do ?
38442,oh no.. what happeneed
38443,ah i hope it all turns out well for you all
38444,"I have, thats a very cool show"
38445,They are very talented on there
38446,"yea i remember it seeing go away a few months back, sad."
38447,yea those were the gold ole days
38448,"Oh no, I am sure you can make it up to her"
38449,"Well you have busy, it happens"
38450,"Love is a great thing, I am happy for you"
38451,"Yeah, people can be unpredictable sometimes"
38452,you need to take them away!
38453,yea i just take them away and let them cry it out.
38454,That is great!  Do you have anything fun planned for him
38455,That sounds like a good birthday.  I hope you guys have fun
38456,Ah same here. If only we had more holidays in a year!
38457,"I guess we'll never though unless something monumental happens, and we get another holiday."
38458,O? Same here. I love storms.
38459,Be careful and don't go outside then.
38460,Nice! What game?
38461,"Oh cool, I've heard of it but never played, I'm not too good with games."
38462,I am happy for you. What kind of work
38463,That sounds like a nice job
38464,I feel you! Do you have everything facing the right way?
38465,"Oh well, it happens though, don't be too hard on people!"
38466,That's terrible. Do you know how long it's been going on?
38467,I'm so sorry to hear that. What did he say?
38468,Good for her! She must be quite proud of herself.
38469,Oh gosh. Diapers are really expensive. I forget all about that.
38470,Oh they're all amazing in their own ways!
38471,What breed is she?
38472,Nice. How much do you expect to make?
38473,That's a pretty good sum of money. I hope you start there as well!
38474,We're all human so having a feeling like that is understandable.
38475,"Yea, I'm always surprised at how much I sweat the little things."
38476,"thats a good movie, cant wait for the live action version coming out"
38477,thats  awesome
38478,8
38479,Is it far away_
38480,Well you can still hang out since its not far
38481,Are you glad its over?
38482,"I am sorry, any backup options?"
38483,That is very true sadly
38484,i know what you mean. my family is 800 miles away
38485,i feel for you. it really makes life tough when you can't just take a drive down the road and see them.
38486,That's horrible. Did he get to go to the dentist yet?
38487,That's very kind of you to be there for him like that. 
38488,Oh no that's awful. I am sorry for your loss!
38489,"Yes, we can never be truly ready to lose our babies like that. I have been through it several times. At least they are happy and pain free now."
38490,me too. it worries me that all the food will spoil and my animals will get overheated
38491,does your power go out alot where you live? it only happens a few times a year here thankfully
38492,Wow. Do you remember losing it?
38493,That's weird lol
38494,I am so afraid of spiders
38495,I have no idea what a wolf spider is. It sounds terrible though
38496,Do you think you'll do well?
38497,What class is it?
38498,"I relate, what is the speech on?"
38499,did yo make some good money?
38500,I cold use some money like that
38501,"thats awesome to hear, a lot of people cheat on each other frequently and dont care anymore"
38502,"i believe so too , if people are gonna cheat why get married at all"
38503,"That's awful, but better safe than sorry. How were things when you came back?"
38504,That's a silver lining in all of it at least! 
38505,That's terrible. I thought they had to offer some sort of alternative. What airline was it?
38506,I've never trusted British Airways. 
38507,You are so lucky to be talented enough to achieve such an honor. Was it as wonderful as you had imagined it would be?
38508,Sounds like it was a once in a lifetime experience.
38509,I have 3- I bet you can't wait to take him fishing.
38510,Was it at college?
38511,OH wow! Did you get it all over youself?
38512,That sounds like a really stressful situation. It's really good to know that there are still helpful people out there!
38513,I'm glad you've put a positive spin on it :) 
38514,Who do you support? 
38515,Cool. Do you play football too?
38516,"Oh yikes! That's a bummer. I'm sure the employees see that kind of thing all the time, though."
38517,Oh that's super excited! I'm sure you're really proud of him.
38518,That's super great to hear! Well deserved.
38519,What a nice guy.  There are fewer and fewer of those every day.
38520,Are you goings going to stay friends?
38521,I hope you get better soon!
38522,That's never fun!  Large unexpected expenses are the worst
38523,"Oh no! At least you have something to look forward to, the new house!"
38524,Oh no! What a terrible thing to have happen! Were you able to confront them?
38525,That is just awful. Now you'll have to pay to have it repaired. 
38526,Nice. Did you like it?
38527,"It was who,who were them?"
38528,"Ok,thats amusing"
38529,Wow! thats great! I bet you feel proud of it!
38530,I bet you were full of joy and laughter yesterday! 
38531,Oh no! Were you gone for long?
38532,What a bad doggie... hopefully they don't do it again
38533,I can hear the sigh of relief in your voice. I bet your anxious about what the next chapter will be. 
38534,I can tell your proud of yourself. Im happy for you!
38535,You will be fine! Stay optimistic about it
38536,"I agree, but having great joy in life helps"
38537,It's good you're motivated! That's a step in the right direction
38538,I agree. I wish I could go back to school and pay more attention
38539,That's amazing and a very quick profit!  I'm a little bit jealous myself.  
38540,"It's amazing the effect something so seemingly small, like the company headquarters opening, can effect an entire town like that"
38541,Yikes.  Did you get injured?
38542,Yeah and the lanes are really slick.  That's pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too.
38543,I would be too! That's a really nice car for his first car!
38544,I do too. Maybe he will left you drive it!
38545,Wow you must be so happy! Nothing like a new car
38546,HAving a reliable car really changes things for the best
38547,Nice! What genre of playlist was it? 
38548,Cool! I like to rediscover old playlists I made when I was younger.
38549,I can only imagine! How is he now?
38550,Doctor's are good at what they do! I hope for a speedy diagnosis and recovery!
38551,That is great news!  I bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new.
38552,It is always exciting to move into a new place and make it your own
38553,"oh , how he reacted next"
38554,its ok it happens with every one
38555,"Yes, that will be awesome! How long has it been since you've seen everyone?"
38556,That's fantastic that you get to see everyone again! I hope you have a great time catching up.
38557,That is a great accomplishment. I admire your dedication in obtaining that goal.
38558,It's really hard to stick with something like that. I wish I could do it.
38559,That great to hear! Have you started a work out program before?
38560,You can do it! Don't forget to reward yourself for all of your hard work!
38561,"Sounds impressive, does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions?"
38562,"Very nice, I would be proud too."
38563,oh no what happened?
38564,that would really help if it was a permanent solution
38565,yeah enough is enough. i totally can't say i blame you.
38566,bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep.
38567,I hate creepy stuff like that because I get paranoid.
38568,That sounds more odd than what I am used too. Hopefully nothing paranormal is going on.
38569,That will be an amazing trip!!
38570,That will be so great for them - I can just imagine meeting my granson for the first time - what a sweet time you are about to have.
38571,Christmas was always a nightmare for me.
38572,I cried every year knowing santa wasnt coming to my house.
38573,That is great! It's so awesome to feel confident after an interview!
38574,Yes it sure is. Did you end up getting the job?
38575,Was it a ghost?
38576,"Oh,that was so hillarious"
38577,"That's great, keep it up if you can!"
38578,It's good that you're being more proactive about your health now.
38579,"Man, i wish i could get one."
38580,I also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well.
38581,Have you ever sold on Craigslist before? I always have the people meet me in the Walmart parking lot during the day. I have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that. 
38582,It will be okay. You could also have the people meet you at the local police station. The police do not mind and would rather you feel safe.
38583,Is it loud where you are now?  New places are always so fun!
38584,"OH that will be such a huge relief I'm sure!  It's crazy that people behave that way, knowing they are causing other people such strife."
38585,Oh no! How did that happen and how much damage did they do?
38586,That is horrible! What will you do?
38587,That is truly all you can ask for.
38588,I try to never take anything in life for granted. 
38589,"Wow, impressive. You must have natural talent. Do you plan to make more? "
38590,You can always sell them as well. I live in Amish country in PA and the Amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each.
38591,I bet! Is it hard to have a long distance relationship?
38592,I can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones! I'm glad you were able to visit him!
38593,"Aww. It's the things money can't buy that bring us the greatest joy, no?"
38594,That is so true and it's a good perspective to have.
38595,"Dogs really are such great companions, what breed is she?"
38596,"Yes I have a miniature pinscher, he just turned 15."
38597,how come? it will probably be an exciting adventure for you to start
38598,"the summer is horrid. heat, sweat, mosquitos, rain, and crowds everywhere"
38599,I do the same! I think everyone does.
38600,I think it's a normal human activity. You don't need to feel bad
38601,That's the way to do it!  Be prepared to kick it's butt and get good grades!
38602,"Always put your school first, you will be thankful you did later!"
38603,Whoa that's exciting!  What kind of car we looking at?
38604,That's a really good/safe first car.
38605,Thats awesome!  What kind of car do you want
38606,Well I really hope you are able to save up and get it soon!
38607,"That's annoying, I hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road."
38608,I'm glad that you are okay! Keep your eyes peeled for terrible drivers.
38609,I can imagine. How old will they be?
38610,Yeah but also just think of all the amazing movies she has done. 
38611,Now that you what? Tell me!
38612,Oh that is great! I've heard that exercise can really help mentally and physically!
38613,That's great! Did you get anything you are especially excited about? It's a restaurant and a store?
38614,Dragon tongue beans! I've never heard of them! What do they look like?
38615,"I will have to look for those. We have a huge variety of foods where I live, but this is new to me. "
38616,It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?
38617,How did he scare you?
38618,I bet that gave you a good scare! Gotta love dads and step dads!
38619,Oh that sounds disgusting! 
38620,I hope he gets that taken care of!
38621,"I think we never really know what is going on inside people's mind. Celebrities like Anthony and Robin Williams seems to live a good life, but in reality, they are suffering."
38622,I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates.
38623,"All around, it would be a good decision for society. Just last night, I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed, he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food."
38624,Oh no. I'm so sorry. Can you video chat with her?
38625,How wonderful. That's what's important and makes life meaningful in my opinion.
38626,"Wow! That is insane, too bad you didn't bet with those kind of odds."
38627,"That sounds like a great time, one of those nights you always remember!"
38628,Yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get. I think it's good because they get a variety.
38629,Yeah schools definitely start things younger now. Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!
38630,I can understand that as I live in Florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies.
38631,"Yes, you are correct. You can always ""hope"" for the best, but also ""plan"" for the worst. Being prepared is a comfortable feeling."
38632,"That's wonderful, they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages."
38633,Wow! That's impressive and a lasting skill for your child to develop.
38634,Did you think about moving after that?
38635,haha are you serious? Did you move in with your girlfriend?
38636,Oh wow! I hope that it was ok!
38637,Oh no. That sounds really stressful!
38638,That is very unusual. She should be proud of herself.
38639,"Wow, I wish more would follow her example. That's a recovery."
38640,I haven't watched actual TV in sooo long. What do you watch on Hulu?
38641,"That's real neat, I might check it out. I've only ever used Netflix, but Netflix is pretty good too."
38642,"Aw, I bet he feels horrible about it.  Poor kitty!"
38643,"Aw, that's always sad, I lost a cat once and I assume that's what happened to her ;("
38644,That would be horrific.  Do you know someone that this happened to?
38645,That is just horrible.  I think they would have to medicate me for the rest of my life if that happendd.
38646,That is nice of your friend. I hope you enjoyed it.
38647,You can return the favor one day. That is what friends are for!
38648,Do you have any idea where you will go? Is it accompanied?
38649,Well I hope they get there soon so you don't have to wait longer.
38650,"I'm with you on this one.  What is up with people these days, I just don't understand how they could do that."
38651,"I think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that, for instance more jail time."
38652,"i had a similar experience, i miss it too"
38653,i totally agree
38654,"I know that when just the 4 people in my family do go out, it runs us about $65.  So we do it very rarely, it wastes a lot of money."
38655,"A week!?  That is just crazy, and pretty irresponsible unless you are a millionaire."
38656,"I spent some time there, when I was learning how to be an Army Medic. I really enjoyed my time there!"
38657,It's better to be safe than sorry. You can't overprepare.
38658,I am glad you didn't get hit. I know how stressful hurricanes can be.
38659,I bet! I hope you were able to catch up!
38660,"That's strange, I hope she makes it out ok this time though."
38661,"Oh wow, I would never consider something like that hurting a dog."
38662,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she passed peacefully.
38663,I am sure she appreciated your visit before her passing. She must have felt loved.
38664,That was a really smart call on your part! Were you worried?
38665,"Well, it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies."
38666,That sounds pretty stressful. Are you moving soon?
38667,That makes sense. I hate leaving things for the last second as well. Hopefully you won't have to leave everything boxed up for too long.
38668,That is great! You are lucky!
38669,It is a wonderful thing that you have someone to share your life with.
38670,Nice! Which ones did you hear!
38671,That one is a zinger! I remember listening to that when I took my grandma to prom!
38672,Im sure you did fine. what was the subject?
38673,That is great! Can you call him and see if we could all celebrate together?
38674,"Well yeah, that sounds about right. He has to go to the Championship first and win, then party time !!!!!"
38675,It is really could to see friends live out their dreams! I will be cheering for him and the team!
38676,That's sound like a lot of fun! Do you know where I can go get lessons?
38677,"I am in VA. I have been looking into it for quite awhile, but I think I'd be too chicken to jump out of the plane."
38678,Nothing wrong with that. I'm definitely with you on the organizational front. I bet they're not laughing when you get them out of a jam!
38679,It drives me nuts when people are disorganized. My husband is hopeless - I could throttle him sometimes!
38680,Oh man that is really annoying!  Have you found another one you like yet?
38681,Oh man I would be so upset.  I totally understand!  I hope you will be able to enjoy your new place
38682,Oh no! Do you know why?
38683,"Aw, I'm sorry. I hope you get another horse that can at least help to replace that hole!"
38684,"Do you know he is coming, or is it just blind luck?"
38685,"That is very considerate of you, I bet he really appreciates that."
38686,Wow. That is quite an accomplishment! Congratulations!
38687,What was is your doctorate in?
38688,what has she been doing? undercover CIA agent?
38689,*wink* *wink* 
38690,"Ha, yeah gotta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home... other wise there's going to be a price to pay."
38691,"It always is, plus it gives you some brownie points as well."
38692,"I am sorry to hear that, my wife has done the same thing. She wore a hat for almost a month when she left the house."
38693,"Well, like I told her, it will grow out, it will just take time."
38694,That doesn't sound good. What happened that was so bad?
38695,That sounds like an awful experience. I probably wouldn't go back there anytime soon.
38696,"Oh lord. Did you try to set it back up, or did you try to sneak away?"
38697,"Oh no, that's really embarrassing! Hopefully they let you off easy since it was just an accident."
38698,I know you're happy 😊
38699,"I feel ya, lonely indeed."
38700,That sucks. Why did you move from california?
38701,That's really common actually. There's a big exodus from there.  They voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high.
38702,"The weather is nice in parts of california, I've been there."
38703,My sister got married at Laguna niguel
38704,That is a long trip.  Did you do it all in one go or did you take breaks?
38705,"That's not bad, I was thinking you were doing it in like a couple days."
38706,"Oh, poor lady. I do hope she's feeling better. What was wrong with her, if you don't mind my asking?"
38707,"Well, I'm really glad to hear she's recovered. Stomach bugs are awful - they really take their toll on you."
38708,"Why was it boring, nothing exciting to do where you live?"
38709,"Ah yeah, that sucks. No time for anything fun."
38710,"What kind of operation is it? I'm unfamiliar with weight loss surgery. But typically surgeries like that are very safe, but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about."
38711,"Well, everyone is entitled to their own life choices. I'm sure she'll be alright."
38712,"Yeah, that's never fun. Did you lose at something recently?"
38713,"I agree, it makes you just want to try harder next time."
38714,"That's great, what specifically has made it so good for you?"
38715,"Wow that all sounds very exciting, congratulations!"
38716,thats so sad oh no! thats terrible. :( 
38717,They are honestly just like children so its really sad. 
38718,"Awww, I totally know that feeling. I hate even going on vacation and not being able to bring my dog along. She is family!"
38719,I can imagine! Is he doing okay?
38720,It must have been! Have you guys been apart before?
38721,Ah so you've gone through it a couple of months alrready. How much longer is she going to be away for?
38722,You must be so thankful!
38723,They are really wonderful. Do you have plans to show how thankful you are?
38724,When will you be going ?
38725,"Wow, I hope you have a really nice trip."
38726,just cause of the way they look or you had an incident involving one?
38727,yea im right there with you on that one along with snakes heh
38728,That sounds like a pleasant surprise! 
38729,Thats so sweet of her and what a great memory to have! 
38730,"That's a terrible waste of food, how old is your little brother?"
38731,"Well, I hope he soon sees that is not something that he should be doing."
38732,"That's brutal, did she get out?"
38733,Did she have insurance?
38734,Awful! did you complaint?
38735,Food should be made hygiene. We shouldn't compromise on health.
38736,"That's annoying, was it garlic bread?"
38737,What did you say to him after he did it?
38738,That's awesome!  I love getting surprises!  
38739,That's so sad.  I've lost dogs before.  I know how you feel :(
38740,Yeah dogs are man's best friend.
38741,Yes I've got one.  She's a stray that showed up to work one day.
38742,She's been a great dog. I've got no complaints or regrets.
38743,Oh wow haha that's not good
38744,"That's an interesting combination, maybe you should try to keep him out of the kitchen"
38745,What grade is he in?
38746,Awesome! That had to be a great confidence boost for him! 
38747,That's amazing! How long have you been running?
38748,That's pretty cool. I hope you win!
38749,"I'm right there with you.. I still feel pretty introverted, but since coming to college, I've been forced to socialize more, and it's help me at least ""fake it until I make it."" I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time, but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?"
38750,"I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better, most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down, too. Good luck"
38751,That sounds awesome. Have you ever been before?
38752,I wish I could go sometime that sounds like quite the experience.
38753,"How'd it turn out? Congrats on deciding to lead a healthier life, by the way."
38754,I'm the exact same way in the gym. Music is a huge motivator for me. One time my phone died while in the gym and the rest of the workout was so low energy.
38755,"Yeah I have, it wasn't serious but I got rearended"
38756,"That's terrifying, I'm so glad you're okay"
38757,That is very sad. Did something recently happen to her? 
38758,That is absolutely horrible. I hope she has a moment of happiness very soon. No one should have to deal with that much loss. 
38759,"Death by a thousand cuts, I call it! They'll try to make a buck off anything!"
38760,Did you try talking to them about it? I can only assume it wouldn't go well but you never know.
38761,"Yes, I have.  One that actually died and one that was miraculously saved.  It was a dark and tough time.  Did that happen to you recently?"
38762,I am soo soo very sorry.  Its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didn't have to happen.  I pray you and your family will find closure and fight for awareness for people who are struggling with those feelings.
38763,"Yeah, I have. Do you?"
38764,It happens. Hope your dog will poop outside soon.
38765,Always sucks when you forget to save it and wake up to a melted blob of brown.
38766,Oh wow! I HATE when you get the urge to eat something and then you get to the fridge only to realize it's gone. Do you know who ate it?
38767,Thats horrible! You should tell them as that is their property. What if someone did that to your stuff?
38768,GOOD on you!!
38769,"I know how you feel, financial problems are rough. I know you'll figure out a way to make it."
38770,"That really stinks! Don't worry too much though, things will work out."
38771,"That's awesome, what was in it?"
38772,"You must be happy to have it back, those are the best memories."
38773,Ugh! I hate it when stuff like that happens. Were you able to get a refund on your tickets?
38774,Awesome!!
38775,That is very true! Was it bad weather?
38776,"i hate that too, what were you going to do?"
38777,"Maybe I could come with you, I'm near Florida."
38778,Why don't you believe him? He made have been quite the big name back in his day.
38779,"Wow, that sounds amazing. I wish I could have seen that!"
38780,That sounds interesting.  What kinds?
38781,Oh that's awful!
38782,Is that like the child equivalent of under the bed?
38783,That's kinda strange. I assume that's something he'll grow out of.  How old is he?
38784,"Wow, that took some guts! What made you want to cut it?"
38785,And just think about how much you're saving on shampoo and conditioner!
38786,"Ahhhh! I've done that before, but I noticed it quick.  Did you not know til the end of the day?"
38787,"That's embarrassing, ah, I'm sorry.  Just play it off tomorrow at work! "
38788,Please tell me it was not full of Oriental Trading Company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes.
38789,"Oh man! I feel bad for laughing but ""literal garbage"" is pretty funny. That sucks, can you report them to eBay?"
38790,That's good. I was never good at chemistry
38791,"I understand, anything you need to talk about?"
38792,Buck up little camper.
38793,How is she doing
38794,I am happy for you and her
38795,i can't believe christmas is in 4 months it's crazy
38796,"mine is the fall. halloween, thanksgiving....what's not to love."
38797,well the casino won! did you at least get some free drinks?
38798,hah.. at least you had fun it sounds like
38799,I do hate when the lights are off too
38800,I am sure I would too. Just be careful
38801,I am happy for you. Are you excited?
38802,I bet you will be fine. Just be yourself
38803,I am sure you will do well
38804,"That must be annoying for you, but I love cats."
38805,Oh that's great! Congratulations on your upcoming finish!
38806,That's amazing. I wish you the best of luck with the remaining classes!
38807,Ohh what happened?
38808,Sometimes things like these happens. Don't worry. But playing hookey is a fun though
38809,I know exactly what you mean.  It gets so lonely on the road.  Have you had to go away recently?
38810,That's still quite a long ride.  Do you do a lot of long distance biking? 
38811,"on to the next one, as they say!"
38812,have the new chick there when she comes home
38813,"Oh yeah.  I've never seen it, I can't watch horror films.  How did you like it?"
38814,Ohhh boy.  I hope you have a person or an animal to snuggle up to to help you feel better.
38815,That's scary when that happens
38816,"Some people DO die from choking, be safe!"
38817,"Oh that makes sense, well be careful"
38818,"Whoa, that is scary! Did you know him?"
38819,I am glad that you are okay!
38820,"Hahaha, sounds kind of like clickbait"
38821,"Hahahaha, that's so funny"
38822,"That is weird but amazing! Does it work?  If it does, I will get my husband to tape his mouth shut.  He snores like a freight train because his tongue slides back I guess.  Is that true for you?"
38823,Do you have any advice on what kind of tape?
38824,That sounds like a nice time!
38825,Wow that worked out perfectly
38826,Did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume?
38827,"Well, I hope you have some really good earphones - or that they quiet down - it's a big egotistical to think that no one around you cares when you are that loud."
38828,I know what you mean. Once I had a bank where the teller's literally had butts for heads. It was so distracting trying to talk to them.
38829,Well it was an upgrade from the bank I had where the tellers were actually robots. I can't believe the cost-cutting measures in place today!
38830,wow  thats nostalgic!!. It must have brought back lot of good memories
38831,does the machine is in good condition now?
38832,Are they going to pull the tooth?
38833,Thats not strange at all
38834,That sucks. What did you do?
38835,"Oh no, the poor girl. Was she able to walk afterwards?"
38836,"You're a terrific partner. You guys can do something outdoors next time, right?"
38837,hahaha why was it underwhelming?
38838,lol how do you feel about spiders?
38839,Why were you getting mad?  Were you not lifting as much as you wanted?
38840,"I see,  I do that too sometimes.  It helps with motivation"
38841,You are good at generalizing aren't you?
38842,I have no clue.. really I don't!
38843,Thats sounds like a fun trip or 8
38844,that sounds cool.
38845,Wow. I would love to see something like that
38846,What did you name her?
38847,Thats so cute!
38848,Oh you must have enjoyed it!!
38849,Yeah indeed it must have been then
38850,So cute! What kind of dog is it?
38851,"That's amazing, I wish I could get a puppy too, but my cat is not friendly"
38852,That's crazy did you ever get it back?
38853,I am so sorry maybe you will have better luck next time.
38854,"Eww, it may be time to call someone to take care of them."
38855,"Oh, that had to be super gross! "
38856,How creepy!
38857,At least nothing happened to yo
38858,That's rough. Did you end up getting the job?
38859,"Well, there's always next time. At least you can chalk it up as a learning experience."
38860,That's strange. What did you discover under there?
38861,Oh my! That is repulsive indeed! I would've taken it home for dinner. Waste not want not!
38862,Oh NO!  Are you okay?
38863,Yeah I bet!  Did they stop and check on you?
38864,"Oh yeah? Is it on par with ""I Have a Dream""?"
38865,Woah now! I wasn't thinking of a speech on that grand of a scale! I hope you blow Gimli's beard clean off his face and make 20 horns of Gondor sound!
38866,wow that was really nice of them
38867,Most people now a days won't do that. Make sure to pay it forward!
38868,"That's great, man! Did you study hard for it?"
38869,"Well, that's all that matters! Just gotta pass those exams!"
38870,"Aw, that's awesome, did it bring back memories?"
38871,"Yeah, it's always nice to take a look back and reflect on the early days."
38872,Nice! Who did you go see? Did you catch a homerun?
38873,That sounds amazing. All I have is my lowly Senators sea level stadium...I am mad jealous.
38874,Oh dang. Was she a hoarder? What did you find?
38875,I can't even imagine the stench...did you make out with any buried treasure?
38876,Oh that's terrible.  Is he alright?
38877,That really stinks that that happens.  Are you pretty upset about it?
38878,I do love a smooth ride. What kind of car is it?
38879,That's awesome! I am mad jealous that you have my dream car!
38880,"Wow, you were dedicated, did you do well on it?"
38881,"Congratulations, all the hard work paid off!"
38882,That must of been pretty stressful. But did you get enough sleep?
38883,Sleep is just as important as studying hard. You can kill your performance without it.
38884,That's terrible! Did you get it back with everything still inside?
38885,At least you have a happy ending for that story.
38886,"I agree. I think I am one of them, considering I gave my whole life savings to charity yesterday."
38887,"That's really great, but I swear it was true! It was a whole 50 cents. Looking back on it, I am kinda sad I did it because now I can't buy that fancy fidget spinner at the supermarket. Hopefully some orphan uses it wisely."
38888,"That's good to hear, what did she do to make you proud?"
38889,"Oh wow! That's amazing, i'm sure that was a really touching moment!"
38890,Sorry to hear that. Maybe you can talk with your boss about changing the schedule a bit.
38891,"Wow, that is a long time! That shows how dedicated you are to your job, and that you deserve some time off!"
38892,That is awesome.  What are you hoping to do?
38893,"That's the dream, to get paid in college.  I wish I could have done that.  Congratulations!"
38894,Are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pick-up?
38895,That is insane! I've never heard of anything like that before.  You all should start protesting!
38896,Oh really? What was it they served?
38897,Oh wow... I really can't imagine eating it knowing it had those in it.
38898,I hope she hears some good news. Is it pretty serious?
38899,"I'll be praying for her, I hope she continues to stay in the clear in the future."
38900,"Oh no, it's awful something happens on that special day that should be full of joy and whatnot."
38901,"Yikes. Well, at least you did the right thing by passing that long, as painful as it might have been. "
38902,"am sorry about that, what are others doing about it"
38903,"sorry, just tryy to be patient with them"
38904,Old school video games are full nostalgic memories for me. That is why i try to avoid them as they evoke many emotions in me
38905,It is just that I miss my friends a lot with whom i used to play. I wish i could just rewind time and go back
38906,I love beer! I wish I could try your guy's beer.  Is it a hard process?
38907,"Awesome, that's great news!  Hope you guys make a great tasting one and become big!"
38908,"ooh, you should not be, she should be appreciated for looking good"
38909,"aha, thats funny though"
38910,"Oh, I haven't read it, but I was also sad to hear he passed"
38911,"Yes, too bad he was struggling with his depression and couldn't seek help"
38912,"Aw, that's so nice of them! Was it fun?"
38913,That's great! It's so nice that you have people around you who care
38914,Ohhh..I would love that experience! How special!
38915,I love that too! I try feeding everyone :) Awesome!
38916,Oh geez! Why was she gone for so long?
38917,That's pretty cool! That would be hard though! Were you all able to talk a lot?
38918,How long have you been there ?
38919,Sometimes we affect people that we don't realize.
38920,That doesn't seem fair. How are they getting around not paying you for it?
38921,It sounds like your boss needs to be more considerate when it comes to his employees.
38922,"Wow, did you ever get them in trouble?"
38923,"There you go, take victories where you can get them!"
38924,"Great, what is his field ?"
38925,I see. I hope for all the best for you and him.
38926,Sounds super relaxing! I bet your enjoying it!
38927,Thats awesome! What kind of soup do you make?
38928,"My brother just graduated and is on the job hunt, and he's described his experience as the same thing.. Seems like he has good interviews and they're receptive to him, but they don't really respond or give him an answer. Sorry to hear you guys go through that. Can't imagine how frustrating it is"
38929,Good on you for being aggressive and opportunistic. Maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job. I hope it's been good so far.
38930,I totally get why you feel that way.  Your time will come soon.
38931,I hope you can recover soon!
38932,That's good! I bet you missed her a lot.
38933,I'm sure she'll have a lot to tell you about her trip!
38934,That's a long time to kind of hang in limbo. I am sorry you had to endure that for a month.
38935,"Well, at least that story had a happy ending. It could have went much worse."
38936,"Aw, I bet you miss her a lot."
38937,"Well, at least the dogs still have you for company. I'm sure you'll be happy when she gets back though."
38938,Interesting! What kind of things do you do?
38939,aw man that sucks how come he gets to get one but not you
38940,well after a certain age parent's start to treat children differently lol
38941,when does she return?
38942,Did you go running like crazy!? 
38943,i would have done the same glad no one got stung! 
38944,"They are bad now too, they are so annoying"
38945,It can be irritating to deal with this time of year
38946,"Come on, the worst that can happen is that it kills you."
38947,It's certainly a good enough reason to kill them.
38948,"Wow, are you nervous at all"
38949,That's exciting. I'd never have the guts to do it so kudos to you.
38950,"That kind of stinks. Sorry to hear that! Well, at least there are worst things to forget outside.. Maybe this is an easy learning lesson!"
38951,"I didn't even think of that! That's one thing about tea with me, that I've never gotten into it because you get it and it's so hot, so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!"
38952,Yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results. How do you feel about it? 
38953,I understand i would be too but now a days technology is really good just make sure its a reliable hospital! 
38954,That's a good friend you got there.
38955,Never take someone like that for granted. They are so rare.
38956,What types of situations are you referring to?
38957,"lol, did everyone around you make funny faces?"
38958,I am so sorry to hear that. Was she able to go surrounded by you guys?
38959,It's hard to lose a family member like that. You guys should take some time to grieve.
38960,That's great!  I've got to deal with loud neighbors too.  Anything specific they do?
38961,"Loud running toddler who pitches fits at random times, day or night.  Sounds like a similar level of noise :P"
38962,"Oh wow, I bet you can't wait! I remember when I had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband."
38963,"Well, she'll be back soon and you'll have loads of catching up to do. I bet the dogs missed her too!"
38964,Could you elaborate as to why?
38965,Oh no could you call an exterminator?
38966,I'm sure you'll do great!  How long have you been training?
38967,"Wow, that's a lot of dedication!  I believe in you!"
38968,"i can imagine, i have been there and it is the worst just belive in yourself"
38969,yeah it always gets bbbetter that is the good thing
38970,That sounds like fun! I've always wanted to visit India.
38971,Nice. I hope you have a great time!
38972,That sounds like a relief.
38973,"It seems like it's a lot of ruckus, I've visited friends who have your situation and I can only imagine. "
38974,Glad you enjoyed that short period of peace. Maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place.
38975,"Oh, good. I'm sure it will be an improvement from your current situation."
38976,Omg i would have been so embarrassed! :O 
38977,thats true imagine if you had! it takes a lot of talent tho to put your pants on inside out and still manage to button them. ha ha 
38978,"that is awesome, i hope that happens to me on my next trip, where where you going"
38979,well you are really lucky to have an empty airport
38980,"I would go mad, were you away at college or in the service?"
38981,"That is great, I am sure he misses you and will be so happy to see you. He will smell you coming and know your there even before you get in the door."
38982,That's not silly at all! I'm sure he'll love it.
38983,"Yeah, he'll be all grown up before you know it!"
38984,Did it turn out how you expected it
38985,I'm glad to hear... Weddings can be stressful
38986,Maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?
38987,Its the only way to get them to learn
38988,"That's wonderful, it's always good when hard work pays off like that!"
38989,I bet so that sounds nice
38990,"Oh wow, that sounds like it was a big mess."
38991,"I hope she didn't eat too much of it, it might make her sick."
38992,Oh yeah? Did you go give it a try?
38993,That's a shame. I hate it when a place doesn't live up to the hype.
38994,That can be a bit uncomfortable for sure. Did you try and avoid conversations
38995,If it gets to be too much be sure to walk away.
38996,He must be really strong!
38997,"Sure,  I strong men is very attractive! You must be proud of him!"
38998,That is hard thing to go through. I hope you are feeling better about it now.
38999,I bet. Losing a pet is much like losing a loved one. It gets better but still hurts sometime.
39000,"Aw, that sucks. But at least he got a job, right?"
39001,"Well, hopefully he can schedule another time to come visit you."
39002,Oh my. That is very unfortunate.
39003,I know that feeling. Im sure she is looking down on you all.
39004,"That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That's kind of why I'm not wild about cats, is because they're so independent, and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people."
39005,Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. I'm so sorry.. I hope you're not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over.
39006,"My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport, albeit a little expensive. I hope you're able to get back to playing again. I've taken up running and swimming, and it's interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day."
39007,"Well, often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself, at least you are forcing yourself. At some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier. Once that happens, motivation starts to become real easy to get."
39008,"I've never been skydiving myself. I hear that it's a great experience, but I'm not sure if I have the bravery for it."
39009,Oh wow. Is it something that you would do again?
39010,"Sounds like fund, you must be excited!"
39011,"I think I will need to do that, my TV is an oldy.  I am sure you will have a great time."
39012,That sounds horrible. I would not have been able to sleep after that.
39013,How terrifying. I hope you were able to find and kill it.
39014,"Well, it's okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and you'll hit that happy medium that's good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?"
39015,I bet you have a good shot at it! Good luck
39016,Did you tell anyone about the dream?
39017,You should call your best friend on the telephone!
39018,That is sure to make you feel the nostalgic?
39019,sounds like a wonderful day!
39020,Oh My!! What are you going to do? I would buy it anyway. 
39021,Well thats unfortunate. Hopefully you will be able to buy it soon. 
39022,It happens to the best of us. It would be great if they did not make us gain weight.
39023,"Well you have to live a little every now and then. I'm sure it was worth it, haha."
39024,"Oh no, poor baby"
39025,Yes cuddles will help
39026,That sounds really fun. Can you still remember some of the routines?
39027,Yea that is a long time. You should reach out to some and see if they are on social media.
39028,"I'm fascinated by how people can watch golf, I always found it really boring, but if you enjoy it then great!"
39029,"Oh that totally changes things I guess, makes sense."
39030,"Aw that's terrible, at least you were able to comfort her?"
39031,I'm sure you were! Those people deserved some confrontation for sure.
39032,Oh my god! what did you do? did you tell anyone?
39033,LOLOLOL the cops probably had a good laugh about that.
39034,Me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures. 
39035,Really!! I would go even further and give them the electric chair. I have no tolerance for those types of people. 
39036,"Oh, I hate it when that happens. Did you find out what it was?"
39037,I'm glad it wasn't something dangerous. That would be a terrifying experience.
39038,"You do? thats good, friends can be terrible people to lend too."
39039,I bet he pays you in full.
39040,I bet that was scary. Did he surprise you with something?
39041,Ahhh. How nice. You are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband. 
39042,Does it look like a space ship?
39043,I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time
39044,What does she do?
39045,"Wow, I would just tell her its private. Sounds annoying"
39046,"Aw I understand that, I have gone through that myself and it's very hard. When did this happen? "
39047,Oh no I'm very sorry. What kind of pet? 
39048,"Oh no, have you been able to calm yourself down?"
39049,"I can understand that, I think I would be a mess too."
39050,"That does not sound plpeasant at all, maybe they should relocate those who are staying there."
39051,Hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?
39052,"I bet you are, that's some pretty good foresight right there! Did you have to use it this past winter?"
39053,"How satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency, and then to actually get to use it? I'm pretty jealous, and proud in a vicarious kind of way."
39054,Well good luck with that!
39055,Do roller coasters scare you
39056,I used to be afriad of heights too
39057,That's a bummer. Maybe next time you can join them.
39058,Sound like a Netflix weekend then. Hope you got a lot of work done.
39059,"Goodness, you're right about that. Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you."
39060,"I'm so very sorry for your loss, I can only imagine that pain. I had to put my girl down 3 years ago and I promise that it does get easier."
39061,"It's the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way, unfortunately."
39062,That's great! I'm glad you had a good time. I've never been on a cruise before but it sounds like I need to try one out!
39063,And how is she doing now
39064,That is awesome.  Sometimes a second opinion is all you need
39065,aww that's too bad.  I hope you got some solid netflix in at least!
39066,bummer.  Well I hope you get a chance to do that soon!
39067,Oh that sounds fun!
39068,"That isn't good at all, glad you didn't have an accident. "
39069,Did you find any good companies.
39070,Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.
39071,It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!
39072,"I know that feeling all too well. But don't get down on it, just try better tomorrow."
39073,That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?
39074,Are you able to do anything to prevent them?
39075,I'm sure that he will turn up soon. I really hope that you find him.
39076,Maybe check your local animal shelters? Sometimes they are taken there by people who find them. 
39077,"Aww, I'm sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?"
39078,That's really odd.  I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.
39079,"How thoughtful.  Now you have to pay it forward, as the saying goes."
39080,Kindness is infectious.
39081,"How exciting, is he a non-traditional student?"
39082,"That is really good, speaking from experience, all military men and women should get a degree."
39083,Why? What happened? I hope you didn't get food posioning.
39084,"Oh gosh, that is gross! Maybe tell the manager so he can make it right, and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!"
39085,Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.
39086,"Hopefully you were wearing dark clothing, coffee on light colors stinks!"
39087,Oh man! I would have been so scared! 
39088,Ugh that's so annoying. What are they even barking at?
39089,"Yeah, that would drive me crazy. Sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs."
39090,"I do that all the time, no big deal."
39091,What kind of pizza did you eat?
39092,"That is such a relief, it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank. "
39093,"Oh yeah, retirement will come before you know it, it is good to be prepared! "
39094,"Oh wow, now that really is exciting, congratulations! Did you get the grade level and subject you wanted?"
39095,Teaching little humans will be such a joy. I really hope you enjoy it!
39096,"That sucks, will she not let you see the dog at all?"
39097,"Yes, that is probably a positive."
39098,Yeah it really does. It's even worse to try and close those accounts!
39099,Man that sounds really stressful...
39100,oh that is awesome. what does she do?
39101,that is great. my sister is an account too. she's also the office manager.
39102,Congrats to your friend! That is an amazing accomplishment.
39103,I would be proud of her too! Hopefully her success continues. You sound like a good friend!
39104,don't be. i'm sure you raised him right. he will be starting his new adventure
39105,i'm sure he's cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck. it will be fine.
39106,it will be find. have a little fiath in him and you will see
39107,it's very exciting. i wish you both all the best.
39108,"I remember that console, that's old school."
39109,Those were the good old days!
39110,are you able to get some tutoring or find a study buddy?
39111,thats good.. well you are on your way up!
39112,"Thats awesome, can we trade?"
39113,"That is a really good idea. He must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready, unlike mine"
39114,that is very true
39115,hopefully its better tomorrow!
39116,"Hmm, that's interesting tell me more about what that number means to you."
39117,"Really, my friend had a tarantula as a pet when she was five, scared the poop out of me"
39118,"Are you really able to work from home? Finding a gig is so difficult, I'm glad that it is working for you."
39119,That is fantastic. Any good new lately?
39120,That is an amazing feeling. 
39121,did you go to the doctor
39122,yuk for sure
39123,"Well, did you eat her ice cream?"
39124,I wonder who actually ate it then.
39125,So are you saying it could be the guy?
39126,You will be fine. Its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.
39127,Then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers. 
39128,"That would be pretty cool to see, but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they're annoyed or angry! It didn't attack you, did it?"
39129,"Ahh, okay. Yeah I don't know. It might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect it's turf. But still, that's neat to see and not an everyday thing!"
39130,"Nice, I guess the only times I was nervous to take a test was when I wasn't prepared, but there's only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever"
39131,Wow! You must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal
39132,"i bet it does bud, I know the feeling. So how do you deal with it"
39133,"yes i know, good memories do help. every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life."
39134,sometimes they cant avoid it 
39135,I cant imagine how scared you must have been.
39136,Not sure. You must be very confused. Did you crash?
39137,"Well, maybe look at its lifespan? Maybe it'll die if you end up not finding it."
39138,what does she draw
39139,Kayla sounds wonderful! How long have you guys been friends?
39140,Finding someone like that is rare. Take good care of that one!
39141,I am sorry to hear that. How far along is it?
39142,Keep a positive attitude. I will be thinking of you!
39143,Did you find out what happened?
39144,Man. That must've been really nerve wrecking. Did you get any sleep?
39145,did it turn out ok ?
39146,hopes he continues to get better
39147,I'm so sorry!  Don't lose hope though. I know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan.  Look up Dr. Joel Furhman.  It'll save you from all the meds that hurt your body.
39148,"I know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and Lupus, it will change your life.  Check out HIV and going vegan on youtube and thebody,com and so many other resources.  You might be able to reverse it and it wouldn't even be a concern for having kids.  You take care and have hope!"
39149,Sounds like you're feeling nostalgic.  What games were you plaing?
39150,I've never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it
39151,"Oh, how did it go?"
39152,"I'm sorry, I am sure you will be ready next time."
39153,"Wait, why would you be annoyed by that? That's amazing!"
39154,"I think you need to look at the bigger picture, though. Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive."
39155,What movie did you see
39156,Yeah I have heard bad things to be honest
39157,Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?
39158,"Damn well, he's gonna have to learn some boundaries with that."
39159,"It is indeed unfair, they shouldn't have done that"
39160,you are right. But hey people just do what they want to!!
39161,I bet that was awkward
39162,"I guess that happens sometimes, did you finish the game"
39163,That is terrible and a little odd!
39164,"Wait, you were ok with her cheating?"
39165,Yes indeed! what did you do?
39166,You did great! Family comes first. And you gave him your support!
39167,That's great!!  History is so important I think and so few kids really grasp it well.  Congrats to him for a job well done!
39168,"Oh, I see what you are saying!  Did he get upset about it?  And you never know, he could turn it around next year and blow you away!"
39169,"Wow, is that true? That's pretty amazing! I'd say science should know about your dog."
39170,"Wow, that surely is incredible! Even the accent too? And intelligent! The full package!"
39171,"Dang, that's a lot of dogs. Cleaned out the pound, you did. But that doesn't hold a candle to the 100 I ate yesterday."
39172,"How dare you question my intestinal fortitude?!? I would watch out, friend. I may just slip some cyanide in your relish if I ever have the chance to challenge you!"
39173,That is so nice of him. Are you feeling better?
39174,That's good to hear. I hope I meet someone that will do that for me.
39175,That would bring the tears. I love looking at pictures especially old ones.
39176,Sounds like you are conflicted. She ran off but she's the best? Are you being sarcastic?
39177,That's a tragedy! What ever did you do?!?!
39178,Serves her right! These animals can't go around thinking they can poop on our things!
39179,"Holy moses, he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Child's play."
39180,"Yeah, that's what they tell everyone because, in reality, they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers."
39181,"Ahh, that's too bad, did you mention it to your boss?"
39182,Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe next time!
39183,I bet. That is so sad. I am so sorry.
39184,I bet! I hope they can find peace soon.
39185,Time will make it better. You just have to move on.
39186,Better to find out now then move in and invest your time. Trust me it's worse.
39187,Really? What kind was it?
39188,"Oh I love apple pie with ice cream, it's such a good combination"
39189,"Nice, I wish I could get a pair of those shoes."
39190,How much did you pay for them?
39191,I love a warm fire outside while camping! Sounds like a great time.
39192,Yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep.
39193,That sounds like it could be quite a scary experience.
39194,Oh yeah that's a bit dangerous. Candles are good to have on hang.
39195,Why are you worried?
39196,That is true but Dubai is a bit better
39197,Oh no! Was it still there when you went back?
39198,You never know these days. Luckily there are cameras everywhere.
39199,why? are you having financial problems?
39200,"oh god , that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!"
39201,"Oh no, what did you do to stay cheerful ?"
39202,"Sounds good, when she got back I hope you schooled her on Halo ?"
39203,what kind of health problems ?
39204,i'm glad you feel good today!
39205,lol! I remember those drills when I was a kid!
39206,And your largest hardback book will protect you from a tornado as long as you put it over your head and sit in the hall!!
39207,That's normal. Try to just be your self. I'm sure it will work out fine.
39208,"Amen, me too.   I hate my current job."
39209,It's not crazy! I'm all about cleaning up. I LOVE the smell of clean house
39210,I find it very satisfactory to clean and vacuum :) I bet it will smell so good
39211,That's good. I know that would be difficult.
39212,That is great. I am sure you are proud and you should be!
39213,"That's always both an exciting time and a nerve-wracking time. I'm in college and I had to move the past two years in a row. This year, I decided I kinda had enough and would just stay put, even though the apartment was just so-so. Do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?"
39214,"Oh yeah, I know the type. Where they sound like they're having a parade at 3AM. Sorry you had to go through that. Luckily (or unluckily, if you want to see it that way) I have a loud window AC unit in my apartment, so even if they did make noise, I couldn't hear them over it!"
39215,Oh wow that is a huge commitment! How did it go?
39216,That is really awesome! Im glad it all worked out for you!
39217,Yes I feel like that every time I look at old pictures!
39218,I agree and time jut goes by too fast!
39219,Do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?
39220,"Exhaust all options, social media is a big way to stay connected"
39221,Wow!  What was in the package?
39222,That was really nice!  What a wonderful surprise!  This act of kindness helps to restore my faith in humanity.
39223,Nice do you still keep in touch with her
39224,Well if you stay in touch then I'm sure she'll come back...but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her
39225,What book do you enjoy reading?
39226,"No, actually I'm under a lot of stress right now and I'm in pretty dire straights financially. The only book i'm really reading at this time is the Bible."
39227,Where is your home village?
39228,"That's a shame. I""m sorry to hear that."
39229,Do you live in the United States now?
39230,Yes it sounds like it was a great place to grow up.
39231,I love dogs! What breed is he?
39232,"That's so sweet! We have blue healers, they just make the world better."
39233,"Oh my goodness, that must have been terrifying until you figured out what was going on."
39234,Well at least you had a good time.  Did they do something nice for you after?
39235,Do you ever offer to help thm?
39236,"GOod for you, I feel bad for never helping out."
39237,Awesome.  What are you going to do with the money.
39238,Don't spend it all in one place :)
39239,"Putting it away for a rainy day is the best bet.,"
39240,"Haha, that's a nice way to enjoy a sad moment, how are you feeling recently?"
39241,I'm happy to hear you're doing better. If you feel that way again please reach out.
39242,"Oh my, you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention."
39243,Aw he's just a kitty after all. I'm sure he didn't mean to make you mad.
39244,"What prize was it, or what was the competition, rather? I'm interested to know, but don't want to pry, if you don't feel like saying."
39245,"Ah, gotcha. It's good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things, myself included. I hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested."
39246,Was it any good?
39247,Sometimes the cheap things are the best
39248,I bet it is! When my grandma was alive it was so heartbreaking to see her in pain. She broke her hip right before her death and she just couldn't recover
39249,i hope she will recover soon. Stay strong and think positive
39250,where is that ?
39251,isnt that where bruno is from ?
39252,That's great that they accomplished that and even better that you recognize their achievements.
39253,OK I didn't realize that they may have gone after you were born as opposed to before.
39254,I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods
39255,"That sounds peculiar. I've never known a dog with such finesse, yours may have talent."
39256,"That's really cool, it makes me want to consider getting a dog."
39257,what did she do ?
39258,wow that was nice of her
39259,What kind of gaming is it?
39260,That's sounds interesting!
39261,I'd imagine so.  How long have you been a sky diving instructor for?
39262,Aweseme.  I want to go skydiving sometime.
39263,wow thats a good job
39264,That sounds frustrating. How did it affect you?
39265,"Ooh, that would be aggravating. I guess there isn't much you can do."
39266,Best of luck! What are you bidding for
39267,Archie? marvel? dc?
39268,Sometimes dogs just bark a lot. Did anything happen?
39269,"Thank goodness. I'd be scared, too. You can't really know whether a dog is harmless or not sometimes."
39270,"It has, what did you see that impressed you?"
39271,They're more powerful than that. More like an early 2000's computer.
39272,What did i tell you about doing that. It was a chocolate cake right?
39273,"Ok, at least it was the right kind of cake you liked. But still not a good thing."
39274,That is really great.  You don't find too many people willing to help others financially.  Do you have a really good job?
39275,It's good just to have enough these days.
39276,Which film was it?
39277,"I haven't heard of it, sounds interesting though."
39278,That's good. I live in a small town but we have a big shopping center across the street and there are all the stores i love 
39279,wow even organic store? that's pretty cool
39280,Really? It doesn't bother me at all. I wonder why you feel that way?
39281,"Well, most people have intense likes and dislikes. Personally, I can't stand cigar smoke, but some people love it! I guess in your case, you need to scrape the food off the plate first."
39282,I can imagine they are a right pain to pick up after!
39283,What an annoyance!
39284,Oh me too. I'm not a driver but that is so annoying.
39285,It can be really dangerous too
39286,That is terrible.  Was it dead or just injured?
39287,"That is true.  I would hate for people to be shooting things that close to my house, too.  Do you know who it was?"
39288,What's been holding you back?
39289,That's a tough decision to make. It's good to try new things sometimes and I'm sure the waiters can recommend you a nice meal you'll enjoy based off your preferences.
39290,That is very cool!  I love when food is authentic.  Do you shop there often?
39291,"I have never tried making Indian food myself, but I do really enjoy Indian restaurants.  I am jealous.  "
39292,That's awesome!  Have you gotten any better yet?
39293,That would be cool.  Hopefully the hard work will pay off
39294,Urgh that sounds like the worst! How early?
39295,So inconsiderate! It reminds me of my neighbours doing building work one morning at 6AM!
39296,Me too! 
39297,How many times do you need to tell them!? :(
39298,"I tend to believe that those who have Biblical faith do have a certainty, that God will bless them despite circumstances. "
39299,"Oh really, when are you going to go see her?"
39300,"I hope you have a good time at the concert, and she sings all the songs you're looking forward to."
39301,Congratulations! That must have been such a great feeling.
39302,I can't wait for the day I move out into my own place!
39303,"I do, I live with my parents because I'm in university and I'm still pretty young. Hopefully by next year!"
39304,Those are my nightmares. They are so big where I live in the South.
39305,I would immediately start spraying bug spray all over. Those things terrify me. 
39306,I don't know how you do it. I can't stand long drives.
39307,Definitely not! Music is a great idea though; I listen to music on all bus rides and car rides.
39308,Thats awesome.  What kind of computer are you getting?
39309,very nice.  Id be super excited too.  Have some fun playing with it
39310,Yeah it is really nice to have other people do your shopping
39311,"Shopping is no fun, waiting in lines is not fun."
39312,I haven't heard of that movie. What's depressing about it?
39313,"Oh dear. I think I'll give it a miss - I cry at the drop of a hat! You should watch a comedy next, just to cheer yourself up!"
39314,"ohhh cute!! i am so happy for you, smart boy!"
39315,"a rare one, i hope he goes a long way and maybe even be the next Einstein we need"
39316,"Sounds painful, did you have to go to the doctor?"
39317,"oh god, that must have been the worst way to wake up in the morning"
39318,"oh, do you have any revenge planned?"
39319,That is really scary!  What was it?
39320,Yuck!  Stay away from that guy!
39321,Sounds like quite an adventure for one semester! What was your favorite place?
39322,Nice! Must have made you really happy to see so many different places.
39323,Lol! I thought you were going to say MESSY! Good kids!
39324,So true! Maybe they want something or they did something bad and are hiding it lol
39325,"Lol ;) Well enjoy the clean house, don't worry about the rest!"
39326,"oh awesome, i love ziplining, last time i went was 3 years ago tho, how did you find it?"
39327,did you enjoy yourself 
39328,Ouch sucks to be you! jk Did you ice it down
39329,Yes hope you feel better
39330,Oh no. I have been there before. It was really sad.
39331,It is sometimes for the best but that doesnt always make it easy. 
39332,How did you do that? Naturally or with chemo?
39333,I bet! Look in too Chlorella and similar to get rid of any toxins from the chemo :)
39334,oh yeah? where you planning to move to?
39335,"oh that's a very good reason to go, i am happy for you "
39336,"this is what you need to do, get out of your car and go give them a beat down that they need"
39337,yea but it will feel better if you take action
39338,That sounds dangerous! You should try to move
39339,You really should! With things like that happening you could get seriously injured
39340,Cool! That sounds like a great time!
39341,Wow that's pretty deep!
39342,"Wow, that had to be quite a surprise.  I hope you like them"
39343,Well thats good.  Hopefully it was a good party!
39344,What brand are they?
39345,That is crazy did you go return them maybe?
39346,and what happened?
39347,how long is a marathon?
39348,Good Luck!
39349,Oh no! I hope no one took it!
39350,Did you go back for it and get it?
39351,Wow ! thats quite an accomplishment. How long did you have to practice to perfect that ?
39352,"Fantastic ! When you get older, your memory tends to play tricks on you lol"
39353,Oh really? Any interesting ones?
39354,That's awful! Sounds like it might have caused you some trauma unfortunately.
39355,Did you catch the person after?
39356,"That is unreal, what did you have in the bags?"
39357,oh my gosh. what happened to him?
39358,i bet is was. are you ok?
39359,"Oh my god, that is a LOT of weight!"
39360,"That's really cool, I honestly can't even imagine someone lifting that much!"
39361,"I've been to one before with my girlfriend, what an amazing experience eh?"
39362,Aren't you the luckiest? 
39363,Really? What was it?
39364,Oh gross! I would be startled too!
39365,You must be mad at the cat for that.
39366,"You got too, my cats dont do that thankfully."
39367,I am so sorry to hear that. We need memories of our fur babies to help us in our grief. 
39368,People do not realize that Animals can get cancer too.  Its more common than we may think. 
39369,That sounds nice. It's always good to remember better times. What kind of music?
39370,"Ha, I used to listen to that stuff back in high school. The My Chemical Romance gets me every time."
39371,Guess you dog isn't one that's going to take the bullet?
39372,lol I've never seen an armadillo but that sounds freaky!
39373,Did you help it?
39374,I hope it get's better! That sounded harsh
39375,what do you all have planned
39376,"that sounds nice, must be a really good ""friend"""
39377,What a fantastic feeling. Where you expecting that?
39378,Well then. What a great surprise. It sounds like you deserved it.
39379,For what kind of project?
39380,Did you tell them to leave you alone?
39381,what about doing something you enjoy? 
39382,i know it can be tough but maybe trying something new or outside your comfort zone might give you an enjoyable experience
39383,What is parvo?
39384,That's terrible. Can you confirm it?
39385,I hope she is okay. 
39386,How ever so exciting! is this your first cruise?
39387,I hope you have a great trip and cherish the time with your family!
39388,"well that was mighty nice of them, you wash dishes ?"
39389,this summer's weather has been really intense here and honestly a little scary
39390,i hope it doesn't get too bad near you
39391,Why did he get called back in?
39392,"Wow, did he get paid for it?"
39393,my sister loves mac and cheese. she would probably live off of that if given the chance
39394,i like paprika in my mac and cheese
39395,What kind of necklace did you purchase? It's good to treat yourself some times.
39396,You will just make sure you have your nice new shirt on with that cool necklace and you will be all eyes lol.
39397,It could be a medical problem. Make sure its checked out.
39398,Ohh I see. That is super annoying. Hopefully she gets over this phase and they get along.
39399,You must have really proud of yourself. Its good to acknowledge your own achievements from time to time.
39400,"I agree, which is why getting into that position can be so gratifying. Hopefully you maintain that level of hard work that got you there."
39401,"sounds like a great time, hopefully its not too hot out there"
39402,That sounds like heaven to me as well
39403,"I have a cat too close to me, they are the best"
39404,Oh thoughtful ! Did she enjoy playing with it ?
39405,Its quite wonderful to share your childhood memories with your children isn't it ?
39406,Congratulations. Are you going on a hollywood
39407,Well I am happy for you
39408,That is terrible. Why do you think that he will lose his job?
39409,I understand. That is very stressful. Did he started looking for another jod? It could be solution.
39410,Thats sad. I love cats
39411,How old was the cat?
39412,Thats awesome. Did she?
39413,I bet you are so proud. I would definitely be
39414,What happened after your car crashed?
39415,Flies are so annoying
39416,I had that problem with a mosquito once. I woke up with a bite on the tip of my nose
39417,I would have hated to clean that up. I wonder why they do that?
39418,Yea that is so gross but also kind of funny. I cant help but laugh.
39419,Do you have to give a big speech soon?
39420,That's the way to go! Practice and practice until you're confident and then the real thing will be a breeze.
39421,That is horrible. Does he puke up hairball often?
39422,I bet it was very embarrassing?
39423,It's alright we've all been there many times.
39424,What kind of pizza is it?
39425,"Thats never good, I love pizza"
39426,Oh no! That must be so frustrating being in a foreign country
39427,I'm glad you eventually found it and didn't have to sleep somewhere else.
39428,"Ahh, it happens. I used to swim competitively so I would sometimes get stunned too when I hear the gun go off"
39429,"Ahaha, I hate running too"
39430,"Huh, ok.  Do you like her a lot?"
39431,Sounds like you don't have much respect for women.  
39432,Sometimes the simplest things are the nicest
39433,I hope you have many more then!
39434,What did you do in response?
39435,"That's awful, did you get injured at all?"
39436,"That is a terrible tragedy, my friend. Did the dog get sick?"
39437,Well that's good. What did you find?
39438,Did you ask him to turn it down?  Or did you just go flip the circuit breaker to the house?
39439,"Did he do it?  Cause if not, I might have needed to give him a high five, on the head, with a chair."
39440,That is pretty disgusting! Did it look like poo coming out again?
39441,I can imagine. Maybe it'll morph into a Super Saiyan poo or something.
39442,That's a dang shame. Did it get rained on?
39443,"That's too bad. Well, on the bright side, maybe a hobo will find it, read it, enlighten himself, and get a job at McDonalds."
39444,Wow that must have been a surprise for you
39445,you got a great husband
39446,"I know how you feel, it's terrible. I actually moved to a completely different state due to hi taxes."
39447,It's worth it to consider. I pay less than half in property tax than I used to.
39448,Always do the same what? What is perfect?
39449,I have been married for 19 years and we have been together 21.
39450,I've been through that process before and it was not easy. Good thing you had a good adviser.
39451,You have been very lucky. You should keep their business card in case you ever decide to buy another house.
39452,That's how it goes. I usually consider the money as a lost cause when lending to friends.
39453,Did what?
39454,I have too... to pay for food though. She told me that she would have paid if I asked but I am too proud.
39455,Sounds like found!   Are you scared of roller coasters?  I love them!
39456,I hope you do have fun!
39457,I know how you feel! Our dog of 8 years past away last week spring. It can be so hard 
39458,Same here. We don't know. He was perfectly fine the night before. We woke up to find him passed away at the foot of our bed. Do you know how yours passed?
39459,What kind of thing?  You could always change that in the future.
39460,"Of course, but that is certainly not the most important thing in life, I hope you realize now."
39461,That's such a great feeling.
39462,That sounds really nice. I don't know my neighbors at all
39463,I watch everyday. love youtube!
39464,"I like self help, motivation, healthy living, and a little bit of conspiracy."
39465,Oh I get those midnight cravings all the time!
39466,You want cake? Cake is there? Obviously you have to eat it! Lol
39467,That sounds like a fun thing to do as a couple.
39468,Why were you so scared?
39469,"Oh really, that sounds nice. I miss childhood."
39470,"Sometimes I feel as though our generation (assuming you're a few years around 30) really got a bad deal as far as the economy, politics, and the overall love in the country is concerned."
39471,Things work out. It doesn't seem like it but they do.
39472,It will. I am sure of it.
39473,Is the city going to build them new ones at least?
39474,Well at least they bought them out and they won't be homeless. Still sucks though.
39475,Oh no! How badly did you hurt yourself?
39476,"That doesn't sound too bad, it could have been much worse! "
39477,Yes I do play some video games.
39478,I've heard some very good things about it. It doesn't come out until November right?
39479,Sometimes life isn't very fair. I like to think of it as motivation to get a better job.
39480,"It happens, I think it's part of human nature. Just try and focus on your own well-being and you'll be alright!"
39481,Good for you!.  My year have been ok too so far.
39482,You seem to be very hopeful!  That is great.
39483,I'm so glad to hear that! Did anything in particular make it a good day? Mine's been awesome too!
39484,"Sick, congratulations! Time to celebrate right?"
39485,"How awful, besides painful, it must have been scary!"
39486,"Were you messing with them, maybe? or taking their honey?"
39487,"I do, as if it were yesterday. I remember most of my childhood through video games."
39488,"I really want to, but unfortunately my GameCube and N64 no longer function. Also a few of my favorite games are scratched to heck."
39489,I'm glad to hear that! Things are really going great for me too!
39490,Same here. Let's hope these good times stick around real long!
39491,"You barely even know her, what was she thinking?"
39492,I really hope she doesn't do anything bad to you. You seem like a nice dude.
39493,So what happened? Did you end up ordering some once you both remembered?
39494,"People make mistakes, it happens. "
39495,Oh nasty! That must have been a heck of a pain to clean.
39496,"I wouldn't have thought it would be so easy, that's good!"
39497,"I'm so sorry for your loss, it isn't easy losing a pet. How are you doing?"
39498,Understandably so. I hope you feel better soon.
39499,Sounds pretty interesting.  How was it? Did you like it?
39500,"Wow, That much!   Were you afraid to be trapped like those poor boys in Thailand?"
39501,Those always make me nervous too. I hope it goes well for you!
39502,"Well, I hope they said you could have it."
39503,You could always replace it for them since you know you shouldn't have taken it.
39504,Are you scared of heights?
39505,I bet that was the ride of your life.
39506,I think those are very important lessons. Do they always listen?
39507,I'm a parent and I wish the exact same thing.
39508,"Not entirely, but I do know depending on the game it can take hundreds of people."
39509,"As a gamer, I'd love to know more about the games that take that long to make. Which ones?"
39510,Oh man! I hate one night stands!!
39511,Oh. Yeah. Probably not haha.
39512,"That sounds like fun, how was it?"
39513,I bet!  When I got to family reunions there's always so much reminiscing
39514,"Ooh, did you go ahead and go through with it?"
39515,"Nice, that's a good idea. Good luck!"
39516,Was she nice?
39517,May I ask what a cryptokitty is? I am unfamiliar.
39518,Does he ask for money a lot or is this a first?
39519,Do you like skydiving?  I would be terrified!
39520,"haha, that's true but you can also live with your feet on the ground!"
39521,Haha that's hilarious! Where was it at on your shirt?
39522,Oh no! I hope your coworkers went easy on you about it. You must've had a lot of static electricity.
39523,How awful!  Do you know who did it?
39524,Yes at least there is that.  But it must be really scary to deal with someone willing to go that far.
39525,"It must have been a very difficult  speech, specially since I imagine you were really sad and moved."
39526,"Of course,  do you feel prepared to do it then?"
39527,Wow. That's quite the feat nowadays. Do you still enjoy it?
39528,"Is it a ""never worked a day in your life"" situation?"
39529,"Oh wow, yes I would imagine that is fun. I am jealous."
39530,That is no good!  Did you manage to get on it?
39531,That is lucky.  At least you made it home the same day.
39532,"LOL, I bet you couldn't move after that."
39533,"I bet, although with chinese you can eat it again in an hour or so."
39534,"Sounds very nice, you must have felt nostalgic for the old times, right?"
39535,"Yes me too, it is for that reason I avoid looking and old pictures when I don't want to go that way."
39536,That sounds terrible! you must have been devastated!
39537,"It was a terrible way to comes to term with dead, I'm so sorry you have to go through that.  I hope time have healed you."
39538,"I love when I'm at a restaurant and that happens. Happy Birthday, by the way!!"
39539,"Everyone always looks so happy and it makes people around you happy, but I understand not wanting to be in the spotlight"
39540,Congrats! It is nice to find someone with things in common. Shared interests can be fun.
39541,I'm on my 2nd as well. I like to think that we will do things more wisely the second time around. best of luck to you both!
39542,Oh that is the worse.  Dis you find it at any point?
39543,And who was right in this case?  Dis anyone turned it in?
39544,That is so sweet of you! How was your experience?
39545,"I bet it feels good to know that you're helping those in need, too!"
39546,"That is awesome, having a significant other and a good job can make a huge difference! "
39547,Those times can help shape you and make you appreciate the good times even more!
39548,"It is always awesome when work and married life get along, without getting in the way of each other. "
39549,Oh no! Did it do any meaningful damage?
39550,OUCH. New car is cheaper than replacing the engine?
39551,Yeah I get that. Plus I guess the value goes way down doing something like that.
39552,Ouch! That must have hurt.
39553,"Don't worry, people won't remember within a few months."
39554,That's what I was thinking.
39555,"Yes I know I am like that too, I can't wait for my new stuff to arrive, I feel like a child on Christmas waiting for Santa's gifts."
39556,I guess it is kind of fun anticipating the arrival of the packages.
39557,"How sad to lose a dog you love! Ta least she/he died of old age, she must be in doggy heaven."
39558,"I know how you feel, there must be two of them though, because my dog is the most wonderful dog ever too!"
39559,That sounds like a great way to spend the weekend.  What type of boat are you thinking about renting?
39560,"Absolutely, nothing like unwinding after the work week.  I hope you'"
39561,"Wow, must be nice. My parents were really poor- still are. "
39562,"Yeah me too. I like that though, I like earning my way. "
39563,I often dream about winning the lottery!
39564,"Hey, good for you! That takes stamina. What was the project?"
39565,Well done! That was a challenge. 
39566,It always feels good to wrap up a big project. 
39567,That's awful!  Will you be feeling better any time soon?
39568,I am so glad you have doctors that you can trust!
39569,"Uhoh. Hopefully you were able to stick to your diet throughout the week, though. One off day ain't so bad. "
39570,"That sounds it. As long as you keep with it though, results have to happen. The hardest part of dieting has got to be the hiccups, anyway. "
39571,That's an amazing accomplishment!  I'm sure you'll do great!  Have you been studying a lot?
39572,"I hope you can stay calm, you seem really well prepared!"
39573,"Oh no,that did not go welll,so sorry about that"
39574,"Thats good dear,congratulations"
39575,"It is very important to have a good support system with health issues, especially if there are many. It helps to know that you have people that are there if you need them."
39576,"Health problems can have a devastating effect on a person if they are alone, so it is wonderful that you have love and support."
39577,Oh. I'm sorry. How old was your dog?
39578,Have you thought about getting another dog? 
39579,"it's a hard decision, you can be apprehensive about making the right decision you know?"
39580,yeah they are! So that is really good!
39581,That sounds amazing! How'd you guys meet?
39582,"Oh wow, that's awesome. Is your sister as happy with her husband as you are with yours?"
39583,Did you hurt yourself? 
39584,Hahahah! Im dying! Im glad you werent hurt.
39585,"Oh, that sounds so exciting! What do you plan to see while you are there?"
39586,The Smithsonian would be amazing. I have not been to DC yet. I hope you guys have a great time!
39587,Oh that's really nice to have something you can remember him by. It must be very special to you. 
39588,That's very sweet. I am certain he is with you. 
39589,Oh my. I am so sorry. That must be so difficult. Are you exploring any other options like adoption? 
39590,I hope you are able to have a child some day. I truly hurt for anyone that struggles in situations like this. I have to aplogize in advance. The topic I chose was about my daughter. I do not want to make you feel sad. 
39591,Did you go for the interview?
39592,"Thats lovely,congrats"
39593,"I no how you feeI I have had to live in worse places than that , but it looks like you found a way out of that situation."
39594,I had to squat in houses before. I'm glad things have changed for you and for me.
39595,Wow. That's amazing. Were you afraid to try it?
39596,Do you often feel like you want to be in control? Cause i totally do.
39597,Lol! Which one was your favorite?
39598,Did you watch Mrs. Doubtfire?
39599,I hate it when that happens. I hope your pants covered them at least.
39600,That would be embarrassing!
39601,Oh really? That's cool! What style of dance?
39602,Wow. That's so amazing. Are you nervous?
39603,Oh my gosh! When did you figure it out?!
39604,Wow I'm so sorry. Were you a kid?
39605,Yeah it can get pretty intense! How did it go?
39606,"Wow, going out in style! Well I hope you found a good job somewhere."
39607,Like where you were born?
39608,Was it a rough place to grow up?
39609,Wow that's awesome! Are you on a team?
39610,"I don't know what's good for sprints, I'm more of a distance runner myself."
39611,I think you can get better dude!
39612,That doesn't sound healthy lol. Does it ever make you sick?
39613,Are you drinking 2% because you think you're fat? Because you're not. You could drink whole if you wanted to.
39614,What. I'm confused. What's a juicy pump. Like a juicer?
39615,Oh. Hahahahahaha. You go!
39616,Dang dogs leaving their things around!
39617,"Yeah, minus one for dogs"
39618,"That doesn't sound good, sounds like you are getting replaced."
39619,Maybe you should just go single for a while and enjoy freedom.
39620,What kind of buffet? Did you get to take a doggie bag at least?
39621,I bet you wish you had that doggie bag now. My mom used to sneek food out. lol
39622,"Oh my, I hope it was delicious, that is a lot of money"
39623,"goodness, i would be so upset, that is a terrible experience!"
39624,"Nice, what program are you running"
39625,"Good game m8, pics or it didn't happen"
39626,Really? I don't find it that scary maybe you just haven't seen true terror.
39627,I have a chucky doll sitting in the chair next to me and it looks at me all day. Now thats a movie.
39628,"Oh wow, I wish I could find the courage to do that, it surely takes a lot of will power. how did you do it>"
39629,"I will totally have to try that, It really is difficult to stop smoking!"
39630,Did you have the choice between truth and dare?
39631,"Dang, street cred off the chains right there"
39632,What kind of things do you like to do?
39633,"Why do you like to pay the bills, maybe you should just get a rich girl or guy to take care of it."
39634,Did you have a good workout?
39635,Nice!  I really need to get back to the gym.
39636,"Oh, that's terrible!  What did you do?"
39637,Did you figure out what made your cat puke?
39638,Oh no! What was wrong? Are you feeling better?
39639,Oh man! I had one when I was pregnant with my son. I feel your pain!
39640,"Nice, when did you guys break up"
39641,"I see, you'll find someone better"
39642,"Oh, why are you crying? Is anything wrong in particular? Have you talked to somebody?"
39643,"Oh I'm sorry, I hope you get the help that you need."
39644,Oh no. That's quite unfortunate for the deer. Did you just drive past it?
39645,I'm sure you wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
39646,Do you have a medical condition?
39647,Are you trying to gain muscle?
39648,I love the USA.  
39649,JFK's speeches were amazing.  We have had a lot of great leaders in our country.  Our country has truly been blessed.  
39650,"Nice, amazing to witness birth"
39651,"Good to hear, have fun with puppies!"
39652,"wow, who was the won who littered your yard with easter eggs?"
39653,"Nice, he probably made you pick them all up too!"
39654,What made you nervous about it?
39655,I see. Is it your favorite food now? :p
39656,Were you able to get it back?
39657,"Well, hopefully your friend will forgive you."
39658,Oh no! I've done that before too
39659,I hope not too!
39660,"A ball, how fancy! Was the girl as stunning as her dress?"
39661,"Yeah, I  can see a dress like that can easily outshine any girl. The dress sounds amazing though."
39662,That is crazy. Did you not have insurance for all these years you missed the dentist appointments?
39663,I hope the problem was not deep in the enamel of the tooth since that requires a lot of work.
39664,The internet is a great thing. I don't know what we'd do without it.
39665,We had an issue with our internet for a couple of days and it was so inconvenient!
39666,I've never felt that way myself. What do you find relaxing about watching animals sleep?
39667,"I suppose when you feel tired, anything can feel relaxing"
39668,Really? I'm so sorry to hear that
39669,Hope everything gets better soon
39670,"Me too, I really miss those days."
39671,If only time machines were real.
39672,It's good to remember days gone by
39673,"Yea, like you can remember those times but things are different"
39674,"Taht is always a weight off the shoulders, I'm glad you are pleased."
39675,"I remember that feeling, finals week is so stressful, then there is that wave of relief."
39676,Did her drive turn out alright?
39677,Oh no! Is your daughter okay?
39678,that's great! what motivates you?
39679,"wow that's so motivating, thanks for that i really needed to hear that"
39680,oh that's weird what did you do?
39681,"no no, dont"
39682,That's great. You must have been working really hard.
39683,And it has paid off. Good for you.
39684,Nice! How long do you meditate for?
39685,Dang! Well I hope you have a stress-free weekend and be full of energy!
39686,Wow. Dump him and beat him up!
39687,"That is unfortunate, he is a scumbag. I hope you find yourself a nice and wealthy boyfriend!"
39688,"Tennis, how fun! Have you noticed improvement?"
39689,"That's magnificent! I've never played tennis myself, but it's a sport I've always enjoyed watching."
39690,"That is to bad, is it someone you have been with a long time?"
39691,"Wow, that is really messed up. Did you end up leaving them?"
39692,"also nostalgic ey? i get you, those easy days, no stress, no limits, anything is possible "
39693,i wish we could go back to those days... 
39694,I'm so sorry you had to go through that! What happened?
39695,I'm sure it was a very difficult experience. you must be a really strong person to have gotten through that.
39696,Nice! How long do you go to the gym for?
39697,I never even leave the house! I am the opposite of you!
39698,"That is unfortunate, what do you usually avoid talking about?"
39699,Well I hope one day your parents are more accepting!
39700,Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. Are you planning on getting  a new dog? 
39701,"Aww, yeah I know what you mean. Dogs are so lovable. I also have a new pup myself. I got him a couple years ago"
39702,"Oh my, what happened? I'm so sorry, no one should treat anyone they care about poorly."
39703,"I'm sorry hun, you deserve to be treated better than that. I hope you know that."
39704,"I'm so sorry, that is the worst feelings. I had to put my dog down as well. I know you did the right thing."
39705,Cats are really some of the greatest companions. How old did she live?
39706,That's good some things just take time
39707,I can imagine. How did things turn out?
39708,I'm so glad you made it through
39709,Great what will you be doing during your time off ? 
39710,"I agree with you,you'll feel good about yourself being productive !"
39711,That must have been exciting to see her after so long. Does she live very far away?
39712,That's a shame. Does your sister have a bad impression of your boyfriend after having dinner with you?
39713,I love buying new clothes! Where do you think you'll wear it to?
39714,How exciting! I bet you'll look flawless!
39715,how has that been going for you?
39716,that's amazing!
39717,nervous?
39718,"that's good! excitement and nervousness are both the same, so it's very hard to tell, but it's amazing you are able to convert all the bad feelings into positive ones! good luck "
39719,"That's a great feeling. Going in knowing you'll do well, and then actually doing well."
39720,"Ingenuity like that will reward you in the real world. Academia is a system, and if you game it, you've won.  "
39721,Oh no! I would be very furuios!
39722,I would be devastated! Maybe he wont do it agian.
39723,"Oh wow, I bet that was nice. Hopefully y'all had a good talk."
39724,"Well, that is fantastic. Hopefully y'all will be able to meet up in the future real soon too. "
39725,That sounds amazing. How are you planning to relax?
39726,That sounds very relaxing. Don't forget the snacks for netflix!
39727,"that could possibly indicate that you are a free creature! and you don't like to be caged! don't worry about it the dream, as they are only metaphorical"
39728,"Don't worry, you're wearing clothes now aren't you? :)"
39729,"Wow that is great for your friend! and don't stress it, we are still young and have plenty of time to save up for a house!"
39730,"Wow that is crazy, I know how you feel, the best solution is to probably find a cheap place to rent out until it is possible to buy one. "
39731,why is that? comfort ?
39732,"OH NICE! THAT'S SOUNDS SO AMAZING, I love watching lord of the rings every now and then, did you watch all the sequels all over again?"
39733,"Wow, that must have been nice to catch up. When was the last time you saw your friend?"
39734,Seeing old friends that you have not contacted in so long is a nice feeling. 
39735,Really!? That is very unprofessional of them to make you wait for so long.
39736,That is frustrating. You should complain to them.
39737,"Oh no, I am sorry that you have been having a rough time, but I am glad to hear that you have grown from your experiances."
39738,"Yeah I believe that you will be able to, but never forget you are not alone! I am always here if you need some moral support :)"
39739,I agree. So often does pride get in the way of personal growth and reflection.
39740,"You'd hope folks would grow up, but sometimes people get set in their ways, and become impossible to change."
39741,"Oh no, what did they say? "
39742,"That is really creepy, I would feel anxious too. I think you should report the to the police if you notice any strange or threatening messages,Feel free to also call me if you need anything! :)"
39743,That sounds fun and scary! You must be pretty fit to take on that challenge.
39744,"I'm sure that there will be some differences, but I'm sure you will nail it! Just remember to be safe!"
39745,"oh my, what are they about?"
39746,"wow sounds like some inception plot line, you need to learn how to control the dream"
39747,Sound like you're making a lot of progress!
39748,That's great! All the hard work is paying off.
39749,"Congrats, that must have been a very stressful time leading up the the birth."
39750,You sound like a great mother. I'm sure your son is very lucky to have you.
39751,Wow that sounds challenging! You must have some serious strength to pull that off!
39752,"You should definitely try! It would be tough, but if you have the determination, it would be so worth it."
39753,Oh no! You should try to make some more friends with your classmates.
39754,I hope you're able to find some friends in the next semester then!
39755,Yeah that sounds hectic. You think you can do it?
39756,Yeah sounds like a handful! Maybe you should weigh your options and do whats best for you adn your family. 
39757,That is great to here!
39758,Not at the moment. I'm too focused on bettering myself.
39759,I'm from the south too! Are you talking about mosquitoes by any chance?
39760,One day we'll find a way to repay them all the misery they've caused us.
39761,Keep up the good work! You will do good in life and be a good role model for your kids. 
39762,They will notice how caring you are! Dont ever cut yourself short!
39763,That does sound like a good friend. How long of a drive is that?
39764,You're lucky to have such a good friend!
39765,Oh no! I've been there. How did it happen?
39766,I'm glad your safe! Those roads can be dangerous.
39767,I hope that your relationship continues to strengthen.
39768,I agree. Life is short and having these relationships is very important
39769,Oh no! I hope it dont bite anyone. That can be nervwrecking.
39770,Im glad it worked out well. I bet your finally content with her being around other rats. 
39771,That's neat and sounds like a lot of fun!
39772,I have not been in years! Was it as fun this time as it was years ago?
39773,What kind of pet is it? Hope your animal is okay!
39774,"I heard rats make awesome pets, I'm so sorry! Is your rat in pain?"
39775,I'm sure with the help and support he will be alright..
39776,"Definitely, I think so too, time and right care."
39777,Oh my! I hope you were the only one there! otherwise that would have been scary!
39778,Oh my god! How embarrassing! Looksl like you will stay inside for awhile.
39779,"Wow, that's so sad. Hopefully a new love will come to you!"
39780,"Sure, it's never too late. And you never know what's gonna happen soon."
39781,Very nice! I bet your very proud of it and are excited for what may come from it.
39782,I bet you worked very hard on it! It will be great!
39783,Wow! That sounds exciting! Have you traveled around the world a lot?
39784,Traveling is the best way to learn about other cultures. You are very fortunate to get the opportunity. 
39785,"I agree, we need more moral people to guide us."
39786,Let's hope they find their way to the top soon for our sake.
39787,"Oh, I'm sure. At least everything ended up alright though."
39788,"Oh man, that's funny and terrible at the same time."
39789,"Yeah, I would keep away from him for another 2 months or so."
39790,"wow, that's an amazing woman. did she rub off on you any?"
39791,that's pretty cool of you. i hope to have a daughter like you someday
39792,Oh that's exciting! Are you nervous at all?
39793,"Oh wow, it sounds like you really love them. I'm super happy for you! I hope it goes exactly how you planned. You sound like a good father."
39794,oh man. it's always tough to lose a parent. how old is she?
39795,yeah i bet. at least you got to know her for as long as you did
39796,"yep she's want you to remember that, even if she can't remember it herself"
39797,"that's very dangerous , driving and being exhausted did you manage to get home safe?"
39798,i'm glad you didn't 
39799,That's nice to hear.  It's always a good thing in a marriage to show each other support through thick and thin.
39800,I'm sorry to hear that.  Just knowing that he has you to lean on probably goes a very long way in helping him get through that.
39801,"Oh no! Were you envious because you liked her yourself, or because you don't have a wealthy husband?"
39802,"It can be you, you just have to work hard for it."
39803,i feel bad for your friend. did you tell her?
39804,"oh god, that sounds terrible"
39805,oh that's so embaressing 
39806,why are were you scared? don't be next time stand up and ask your teacher you want to go to the toilet otherwise you will wet your pants
39807,That's hilarious! Is he usually down for a good prank?
39808,"Well, that's fair. If he pulls them, he has to be willing to have them pulled on him, too."
39809,"I can understand that. It's a tough trip to make, but hopefully you'll be able to soon."
39810,and how was it? did you enjoy it?
39811,That sounds like so much fun! I love parties!
39812,"Hey, I just had that one! What do you have planned?"
39813,That sounds like fun! Are you looking forward to seeing anyone in particular?
39814,Well I hope she's there. Maybe she'll regret how she treated you.
39815,Oh no! Hurricanes are scary.  I've been through a few myself.  Was it your first one?
39816,I lost power in our last hurricane for 3 days.  Did the wind do any damage to your home?
39817,"In the end, I'd rather be  in a hurricane than a snow storm.  lol"
39818,"Wow,  you are a vegetarian? "
39819,"This is serious.  For me,  I don't joke with meat"
39820,that must've made you so furious
39821,you sure are a very strict parent.
39822,That's great! I'm sure you'll be well prepared. 
39823,Then I am sure it will go well for you. What is it in?
39824,"Wow,  what happened to her eyes? "
39825,Ohhh sorry about that. It is well. 
39826,That's got to be an amazing feeling to have going for you. How do you feel?
39827,"It's going to help your family out so much I bet everyone is so proud of you, congrats you deserve it."
39828,"That's rough, I'm sorry to hear that"
39829,I am sure you will find someone who will love you even more than your ex did soon.
39830,"That's too bad, you have to go out and make new friends."
39831,"Suck it up and get out there, it is the only way or you will end up very lonely."
39832,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that!
39833,Is there somewhere you can go for extra help with that course? A tutor or something?
39834,That's so annoying.  I hate it when that happens.
39835,"Can you block her out, maybe?  Get some noise blocking headphones?"
39836,The ones with the little colored sliders on the end? Those were cool!
39837,I liked them too.
39838,Has it been on the market for long?
39839,Wow! That's awesome. I'm sure you'll sell soon.
39840,"oh that's too bad, what did you end up doing"
39841,"you should defently and don't let this affect you too much, maybe she has a good reason"
39842,"that must have been an explosion and a half, did  you clean it up?"
39843,"i can imagine, that's gross as hell"
39844,oh no! that's terrible! I've had that happen before and it sucks
39845,I can imagine. did they steal anything?
39846,"I know what you mean.  I love to see all the pictures, and think back to how little mine used to be."
39847,They do seem to be grown before you know it.  Make you wonder how if goes so fast!
39848,Sometimes it's ok to indulge. Did it give you a stomachache though lol?
39849,You should follow up with a few veggies later on maybe to balance it out. I know that feeling though. Its just so good you can't eat just one lol
39850,I'm so sorry for your loss! It's so hard to lose a parent.
39851,"Sadly, I don't think we can ever be prepared for that kind of loss."
39852,"Wow,  that's so nice of you"
39853,That is cool.  You are really so caring 
39854,"Oh darn, that sucks.  Keeping a positive attitude is the way to go! I'm sure something is out there for you."
39855,And here the job market was supposed to get great again.  lol
39856,Oh no! Can you replace it?
39857,I'm sure your friend will be understanding that it was a mistake.
39858,oh no I am sorry to hear that! They must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind
39859,"I am sure they had their reasons, maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright. They may be going through their own problems right now. "
39860,"I agree. The sound of birdsong, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, the purring of your tabby-cat. You can't beat that, can you?"
39861,"You should! Forget about your worries, if only for a moment. You'll return feeling refreshed."
39862,"Yikes, that's not a fun situation. Did you figure it out pretty quickly?"
39863,"That's good, I'd be mortified if that happened to me."
39864,I've had that happen before. My cat is definitely more my wife's cat now. Does he still cuddle up with you?
39865,"Haha, same for me. It's like as soon as my wife is available to sit or lay with, I'm chopped liver."
39866,"I'm sorry for your loss, I bet you two were close. What did he leave you?"
39867,Oh he worked for congress? That's very interesting. That sounds like an awesome haul of vintage stuff.
39868,That was kind of you! Has his truck been repaired?
39869,Of course! Your dad is very trustworthy.
39870,Can you please give a little more detail about what happened at your friends house that made you not want to show your face??
39871,"How embarrassing! I did that one time when I was sleeping in my bed and I thought I got up and went to the bathroom to pee, but I did not go to the bathroom, I peed my pants in the bed. "
39872,"That is so cool, my mother in law has bears come into her yard! I'd be happy with the hummingbirds, so pretty."
39873,"The squirrels keep stealing the feed in my birdfeeder, they do trapeze to get to it."
39874,That's amazing! We just got a new puppy this last weekend also! What kind is yours?
39875,Aw that is super cute! Dogs bring such happiness to a home.
39876,"Oh man, I'm really sorry you have to go through that. Betrayal like that is so painful. How are you doing?"
39877,"Of course, no one deserves to have their heartbroken like that. I hope you find someone who treats you with the respect and kindness you deserve."
39878,Sugar is very addicting! I'm glad you could make it
39879,Caffeine headaches are no joke.
39880,"Sounds like you were just misunderstood. I discuss things with my husband, too, and it's not like talking behind someone's back. That's what married couples do. Don't feel bad. "
39881,"Yes, just tell her your home is a safe place to talk. It's okay to open up in the family. "
39882,Awesome! Did you play any of them after you found the box?
39883,"Neat! I haven't played them. Even though everything is becoming digital, I find there is something special about the physical copies!"
39884,"Ugh, sorry! You must be disappointed. But remember if the door doesn't open, it probably wasn't yours. There's something else in store for you!"
39885,Sometimes they already have a candidate in mind but have to go through the motion...the same thing happened to my husband. Your time will come.
39886,I can't even imagine how devastating that would be. I think you must be really strong to be able to move forward.
39887,"You might, but I believe you can have a full life as a single person, too."
39888,"Wow! A 20 foot boat, that must be amazing to take out on the lake! How much did it cost you?"
39889,"Id love to own a boat, are you using it for leisure or fishing etc? "
39890,They both sound like great plans! Tubing would be a great way to keep her happy while you fish haha!
39891,I hope you do! It makes you feel like you've actually earned it!
39892,I'm always leery of loaning money to friends
39893,That was a nice surprise!  I have tried lending money to friends but finally had to stop after never getting it back
39894,Oh no! How sad! Did you ever find him?
39895,"Oh, how awful! I'm so sorry!"
39896,"Wow, very cool. The last time i tried to skateboard i almost broke my tailbone. props to you though!"
39897,Is it though? haha. If you can do it without falling down then you are doing better than me. Probably a good bonding experience i'd imagine. 
39898,"Too bad for them! My sons 6th birthday was just last week, and we had a fun party. There so much easier to please when their little lol."
39899,They do. I can't believe how fast the time goes.
39900,That must have been aggravating! Job hunting is so hard.
39901,Maybe something better will come along!
39902,Well I hope you got there in time and nothing bad happened.
39903,"Oh know! I hope you weren't heading to a job interview, haha."
39904,I'm so sorry. Have you tried any natural remedies?
39905,I hope you find something that gives you some relief!
39906,That's awesome. Did you get him it? I bet he loves it.
39907,Haha I would've done the same. Those toys always make me lose myself. They're so much fun!
39908,Wow you were lucky! It has happened to me before too. It feels so violating.
39909,Because you were not in it. :)
39910,That is so nice of you all! I know she appreciates it.
39911,"Aww, I'm so sorry but know you made a difference in her life."
39912,that is good! did he make any friends?
39913,That is really cute!
39914,That's awesome! Whats your secret to success?
39915,Well he seems to be guiding you in the right direction. I hope your blessings continue!
39916,"First day of school I remember ,my kids first day of school, how did it make you feel?"
39917,yes it does but we always got or memories.
39918,Neither could I.  It was the first thing that was on the news right after I woke up.
39919,"Yea, I try not to think about that though because then it makes me sad."
39920,That sounds amazing! How long does it take to make the beans? Do you have to soak them? 
39921,I can smell the beans and sausage as we speak.. I always find after cooking I'm never hungry. Maybe that's because I snacked the entire time I was cooking.
39922,"Oh no.  In those cases, it's either the best news or the worst news."
39923,"I'm sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately, I know that same feeling all too well."
39924,Woo hoo! That is awesome! Congrats! When will you find out/
39925,I hope so too! I'll be sure to keep my fingers crossed for you! Good luck!
39926,Good think you're prepared 👍
39927,Hopefullybeveryday goes well.
39928,Oh no!  That's such a shame.  Did you go to the principal?
39929,"I'm so sorry!  I hope it gets better for her.  Middle school is no picnic, that's for sure."
39930,Oh no! That's horrible. Please tell me you didn't. 
39931,"Awww, that is awesome! I am so proud of you! "
39932,that is so sad i hope your pet gets better
39933,"that is so sweet, i think that is why she got better, your caring ways"
39934,Do you like cats? Kittens are the best!
39935,Yes I love cats as well I have one orange one and 4 dogs that get along pretty well all together
39936,Congrats!  How long have you been playing the cello?
39937,How did you place in the competition?
39938,Oh dear that's embarrassing! I hope you didn't hurt yourself. 
39939,Oh ha! I guess that's painful!
39940,I am sorry. Breakups are the worst. Did he just not want to give up overtime or he worked 70hours always?
39941,That's rough but you deserve someone who is willing or wants to make the time for you. Never settle for less than what you are willing to settle for.
39942,Why did yall break up?
39943,That doesnt leave much time for yalls relationship
39944,Oh darn I hate when that happens! I've experienced the same thing in the past once.
39945,Yep not always a terrible time to eat out at least.
39946,How did they do?
39947,How old's your child?
39948,Just barely older than my son. I can definitely understand that.
39949,what happened why were their so many dead fish?
39950,I hope they are not using the lake for drinking water .
39951,Good luck! I'm sure it will be fine.
39952,"You're too hard on yourself. Everyone messes up sometimes, even the greats."
39953,Yikes that's no good. How many stitches did you have to get?
39954,What happened to the dog afterwards?
39955,That's quite the win! What was the bet?
39956,Oh! Gotcha! I've never played the switch but I heard it's an exciting console!
39957,"Oh cool, where does your friend live? Is it an exciting location?"
39958,"Oh man, don't bail on your trip. Try and get those thing that came taken care of this week. You don't want to disappoint her."
39959,"Oh no, I bet your parents were freaking out."
39960,Oh that sucks getting blamed for it when it was their fault.
39961,"Do you get much use out of it, or is it just collection dust?"
39962,"I guess you can hang on to it, or maybe there's someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin'."
39963,well dang! that is very impressive! 
39964,"Understandable, i bet the had good budgeting skills and a nice job."
39965,"Oh no!! That is terrible, do you know what happened? "
39966,"Oh no, I am sure they meant no harm, they always say that they are more curious when they are young. "
39967,"It will pass in time, even though it feels awful right now."
39968,Aw I'm sorry. I remember feeling like that and it was horrible.
39969,"Oh that's great! 9 years together is a long time. You sound happy, I'm glad."
39970,What did y'all do? Did you do anything special that evening? 
39971,"Oh, I know exactly what you mean. It's not the same as going as a kid."
39972,"Yeah, it's no wonder these animals go crazy on humans sometimes."
39973,Wow! what did you write about?
39974,"Nice, well I hope you have a nice trip!"
39975,Congrats! That's exciting. Is the new place far from your current home?
39976,"Wow, thats really big! I hope you have a stress free move. I know it can be a little stressful, but you seem very excited!"
39977,"Wow, really? Did you have any feelings for him? "
39978,"Hahaha, that is so cute, I am sure he loved that you teased him like that! I bet your classmates also had a good laugh! "
39979,Wow! What field are you going to be working in?
39980,Dang! I hope you make lots of money!
39981,"Wow! Congrats to her, and I am sorry that you didn't get the prize. What did she win? "
39982,Wow that is a great prize! Is she able to take anyone with her or is it just a ticket for one person? 
39983,"Wow, were you at a festival?"
39984,I have seen that before. I have no idea how they can do that.
39985,o That sounds exciting. Moving or spring cleaning?
39986,Ya last time I moved I was packing for about 6 months. It's smarter to do it a little at a time and get things purged and organized. 
39987,"Oh no that is terrible, I can not believe that they would drive off without leaving any contact information! How bad was the accident? "
39988,"Wow, that is terrible. I hope that you are able to catch them or find surveillance videos of who did it, because most malls do have cameras in the parking lots."
39989,Aww were you excited when you picked her up?
39990,I bet! What kind of dog is she?
39991,"Uh oh, be careful about that, you don't want him becoming dependent on you for handouts. "
39992,"Well that's good. I hope it works out for both of you, maybe you could give him some budgeting tips. "
39993,"Oh my god, you should have reported her."
39994,I am really appalled at people these days.
39995,Me too. Well I hope it is to somewhere that you like.
39996,I'm sorry to hear that.  Hopefully something similar comes along sooner than later.
39997,Just remember to keep your head up and don't give up!
39998,"I do hope they stopped the car at least ! That sounds disgusting, but its better than throwing up in the car right ?"
39999,I can imagine when something unexpected like that happens. I do hope they are ok now :) Sorry you had to witness that !
40000,New adventures! I want to go west.
40001,I bet you are nervous.
40002,Oh no. I bet they are going to charge you for a new one.
40003,Maybe they will understand.
40004,Aww. I had to put mine down last month. I miss her.
40005,Border collie. She was great!
40006,What kind of job did you get?
40007,What do you do as a statistic
40008,How do you think it will go? Are you confident?
40009,What subject is it?
40010,That is horrible! I hope he was okay.
40011,well that's good to hear I guess. what do you do?
40012,what's your most successful campaign so far?
40013,I always need convincing to take my yucky medicine
40014,that's amazing! what kind of job is it?
40015,"i'm glad your interview went well, and i really hope you get that call soon!"
40016,"you can always make new friends, and talk to your old friends at the same time!"
40017,"yeah but you never know , you may make life changing friendships so be patient!"
40018,You gotta stick with what you know sometimes.
40019,That's right. There's so sense in deviating. 
40020,"I feel you there, I have a ton of stuff to do, but I can't get any of it done in this rain. "
40021,"I really hope so, I am not sure how much longer I can let my yard grow before it gets too wild. "
40022,"oh I am so sorry. That must be fresh on your heart, may he rest in peace."
40023,I can only imagine. I am so sorry. What was his name?
40024,That is great to be prepared. Where do you live?
40025,"Oh yeah, you definitely need to be prepared. Do you think you will get a hurricane?"
40026,"Wow, see enjoyment."
40027,You are so lucky. Some men pray for that kind of wife
40028,What kind of illness occurs if food is cross contaminated? I'm so sorry this happens to you.
40029,"You suffer from it more severely than most people I know, this can be devastating to people. "
40030,Wow that is weird.  I love Diet Coke.  What was wrong with it?
40031,"Nothing worse than a bad soda! lol.  I like the new Freestyle machines, it's always just right."
40032,aww. I understand you. That feeling is priceless.
40033,It's alright to feel such sentiments buddy :)
40034,Yum!!! I love pancakes. Is it your favorite food too?
40035,That is great you have a sweet wife! 
40036,It is so great to hear about a happy couple :)
40037,I bet she is a great cook!
40038,That sounds exciting! Is he good at keeping secrets?
40039,Fingers crossed for you!  I'm sure it will be fine.  Are you nervous?
40040,Being a business owner is hard. I'm sure she is grateful for your help.
40041,"Yes, mental and emotional support is the best kind of support."
40042,What kind of car is it? 
40043,"ooh nice! just start to SAVE, SAVE,SAVE where ever you can and you will get there."
40044,Time goes by so fast. You'll see. 
40045,"LOL, well there is always luck!"
40046,I remember those potty training days!!!    I bet you were so embarrassed.
40047,THank goodness you had extra supplies on hand.   My son was the hardest one out of my 3 kids to potty train.   I feel your pain!!
40048,"Oh, did you give it to him yet?"
40049,That's so cool. I'm sure he will love it! Where did you get it?
40050,I love vacations I hope you and him have a good time.
40051,What cruise line are you using did they give you a good discount.
40052,Oh my goodness! What happened?
40053,"Oh, I know what you mean. I have felt that way. Best thing to do is pray about it and don't be hard on yourself."
40054,That's amazing! I'm so happy your prayers were answered. God knows your heart.
40055,I've never done that but i know plenty of people who do that. Its normal every know and again but don't turn it into a daily habit!
40056,"Damn that sounds good, honestly its fine every know and again. we all have a sweet tooth."
40057,"Aw, yay!  How old is he?"
40058,I love that age!  My niece just turned six and she seems so grown up!
40059,"Oh thats awesome, im sure you were excited to help"
40060,"thats great, sounds like a fun time. And you got to share time with your daughters which is awesome."
40061,"Oh that sucks, have you experienced the symptoms?"
40062,"Oh damn thats terrible, I hope it didn't affect your life too much."
40063,"That sucks, hopefully its just something minor. You're a good person for taking care of her"
40064,"Oh, that sounds bad, probably a stomach virus. those suck!"
40065,"Thats great, perfect time to unwind and relax, and earn money!"
40066,"Awesome, sometimes they can get annoying always running around and nagging you."
40067,I'd have been nervous too.  When will you find out?
40068,"Oh, I would love time away like that! How did you enjoy it?"
40069,That sounds wonderful! My body is craving something like this. Thanks for the inspiration!
40070,"Oh no, did they do something embarrasing?"
40071,That's absolutely disgusting!
40072,Did the two of you have fun?
40073,That's awesome. My son has a skateboard but can barely stand up on it.
40074,I am sorry that you are out of work.  Have you had any job interviews? It is good that your father is able to help you during this time.
40075,"Well, I am glad you will hopefully get some disability income.  It sounds like your dad isn't the type who expects to be repayed.  He sounds like a great parent."
40076,Did everything work out ok? How did you like them?
40077,"Oh, me too. I don't even like to sit in the waiting room."
40078,"Interesting, are you feeling OK having less bonding time?"
40079,"I see, I imagine time will start to fly once you take up a new hobby, or school ends for the day."
40080,That's not very fun. I hate traveling like that.
40081,At least you got to see your family for a little bit.
40082,"Ew, that's always the worst. What were you getting?"
40083,That's always the case! So annoying. I love the self checkout options. I wish more places had that.
40084,Oh no! I am sorry to hear of your loss. Are you taking it ok?
40085,"Yeah, funerals are really sad but they can make one appreciate life so much more."
40086,Wow i'd be jealous
40087,Same. I have a chance in a few years to go with the family but not 100%.
40088,"I bet it is! I love getting together with friends, especially if it has been a while...which it seems to be the older I get."
40089,I bet it would be tough.  Was there a special occasion that brought you all together?
40090,Thats so awesome! I hope you all had a ton of fun!
40091,"Hahaha, yes we women don't want to get the men angry. But clothes are so expensive these days. We just want to look good for our men."
40092," I guess you can just tell her like you told me just now. Maybe she won't be afraid to tell you next time....... well maybe, lol."
40093,"Yikes, that doesnt happen too often in today's culture.  Did you say anything?"
40094,That might be for the best.  Were they arguing about her color or something else?
40095,Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.
40096,I'm sorry you don't get to see her much. I don't see mine often either. I'm sure it did make you sad.
40097,"Yeah, I understand that. I live about 45 minutes from mine and everyone is so busy all the time. Maybe you will be able to see her soon."
40098,Great! Are you home all day or do you just get them off to school and then head to work yourself?
40099,For sure! I bet it was nice to have the hosue a little more quiet too.
40100,Oh that must have been torture! Is everything alright?
40101,I can imagine. Glad you are ok though! :)
40102,Oh no! that's no bueno. Usually the person that wants the least deserves the most. Thats sad
40103,Oh that's awful and borderline abusive
40104,"ah, you must have great memories than"
40105,you know today's events are tomorrow's memories
40106,Cool! What kind of fish do you expect to catch there?
40107,"Yum! Invite me over for some fish dinner sometime, won't you?"
40108,That sounds like fun!  Is it with friends?
40109,"So cool, I hope it goes well"
40110,That is 
40111,"That is so nice when family visits. It is so much fun! But yeah, it is a lot of work for sure. "
40112,"Oh, Happy early Birthday! What is it that you are hoping for?"
40113,Nice! I hope you get it! Cameras are such a wonderful tool to have these days and there are so many cool options to choose from.
40114,oh jeez! what a mess.
40115,I like dogs but thats why i dont have one lol
40116,Excellent! Stay hydrated!
40117,Sounds like fun!
40118,"Wow, that sounds quite disturbing. Was someone breaking in?"
40119,I'm glad everything turned out okay!
40120,Yeah flooding is a real problems these days. The weather is crazy! Hopefully you and your house will stay nice and dry.
40121,I would be scared too. I hope everything will be ok for you. Fingers crossed.
40122,"you sort of gamble on store bought cakes, did you take it back?"
40123,"you are a lot bravery than I, I do't think i could it eat"
40124,Do you feel any less nervous?  Job interviews are always nerve-wracking 
40125,"Either way, as long as you feel a little bit better it was worth it.  I'm sure you'll do great!"
40126,Oh yeah! I love chocolate anything! But grandmas cooking is always the best of all!
40127,Not me! haha I love them all!
40128,that must be a cute picture
40129,so young and ready to conquer the world
40130,What video games are the two of you playing?
40131,It's always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills.
40132,You must really love that dip to have that much of a reaction to the loss of it.
40133,"I would assume so, since there has to be someone out there who robbed you of your oniony gold!"
40134,Congrats! is it a good promotion?
40135,Wow that is super exciting. Not many people get that opportunity. You must have worked hard 
40136,"Wow, that's really exciting! Good for you, you must be nervous. "
40137,"That's great, what kind of work are you in?"
40138,"Well I really hope you get it. You're right, you did what you could. "
40139,That's horrible news!  I don't understand how people can be so cruel sometimes.
40140,"I know in some places, the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids.  Nothing makes sense sometimes. "
40141,Was that a good day for you?
40142,That's amazing! Sounds like a beauty day! Are you English?
40143,"Oh, but I bet you appreciated it! Summer can get long. "
40144,"Oh, that does sound like a fun summer. I read recently that we only get 18 summers with our kids- make them count. "
40145,It's good to stop and appreciate teh moment sometimes. 
40146,"Oh no, I can imagine so! Was it gunky?"
40147,"Oh goodness, glad you got through is safe lol"
40148,"Oh, that's not right. I have a rescue dog, she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year. "
40149,I could chat with you all day! We have a lot in common- I feel the same way. Keep chatting? Poor rescue animals. 
40150,That's great! So sad for those poor animals. 
40151,They should- they say people who hurt animals will hurt people too. 
40152,"That sounds awesome, I'm glad he did well. "
40153,I hope he gets the team he wants. 
40154,You must be relieved! You excited for free time?
40155,That sounds seriously like a dream. I cannot wait until mine are old enough to start school.
40156,4 and 1. I have a bit to go haha.
40157,Awww that will be a boring week. Sorry to hear that. Maybe you'll be productive!
40158,I hope it flies by! 
40159,Was the owner not around? Did the dog cause any harm?
40160,Sounds scary! Dogs are very loyal creatures but can cause a lot of harm
40161,That is very heartbreaking. How did you find the kitten?
40162,"Very sad to hear. You have a good heart and are very caring, that is something to atleast be proud of!"
40163,"Kids pick those things up quickly.  And it'll help with her hand-eye coordination, reading - all sorts of things!  "
40164,"Yeah.  Back when the only buttons on a controller were Start, Select, A and B!"
40165,Oh no! Hopefully you are able to get it sorted out. It's hard to keep up with all the fees for kids schooling.
40166,"Sounds like a headache, i know the feeling. I got a letter saying i had a few days to purchase a purple shirt from my daughters school. Good luck!"
40167,That would be rough.  Hopefully youre in a better spot now!  Thats awesome you had family to help you out too!
40168,"I bet they do! I mean they do go to school for a while and study hard, plus the schools arent cheap but they still dont have to charge as much as they do!"
40169,"i would love some quiet time to myself, consider yourself lucky!"
40170,"i have a husband and three kids, its always loud in my house"
40171,Oh no! How did you guys get caught?
40172,"I bet, did you both get in a lot of trouble?"
40173,What movie was it?  Is it currently in theaters?
40174,Thats too bad! I was hoping that one was going to be good!
40175,Oh my gosh! I would be furious as well. 
40176,I am sorry that happened. Don't do him any favors.
40177,"Yeah, you need peace and quiet to be able to work."
40178,My son keeps trying to show me Youtube videos so I completely understand
40179,That is normal that just means that the other person is special 
40180,Well i will keep my finger crossed for you!
40181,Yeah i can imagine but a little worm wont hurt ya
40182,I understand but atleast it was not poisonous 
40183,I live in bear country.
40184,I bet I would have been scared
40185,"Awwww. that is so sweet! Details. Boy, girl, breed. "
40186,Awwwww. He sounds super cute! Have lots of fun with him. 
40187,oopsy. I hope it was worth it. 
40188,LOL! Can  you run out and get another pie before she gets home?
40189,"That sounds terrifying, so glad you did not step on it"
40190,I can imagine I would have nightmares about that 
40191,And be watchful when you do!
40192,Congratulations. Thats always a plus.
40193,If the movie is worth it you will never miss them.
40194,I understand. Its tough these days.
40195,I love butterflies because of the colors. What color was the butterfly?
40196,Yellow butterflies are beautiful. Photography can capture some great images a lot of times.
40197,"Oh, my dog did that, too! I don't know how they think it's a tasty morsel...so gross!!"
40198,"I was just going to say the same thing! I'm like ""Stay away!"" "
40199,I love cats.
40200,I agree absolutely
40201,Congratulations. I hope you get it?
40202,Just relax. If its meant to be it will be.
40203,That must have been scary..
40204,How long did he think he had won?
40205,That was funny I bet.
40206,"Oh wow, did you give him the money?"
40207,"That would be so scary, I am glad you are safe!"
40208,I'm so sorry to hear that. How long had your cat been with you?
40209,It's always hard to go through that. That's why I'm wary of having any pets
40210,Does he like to sing?
40211,I bet he sings in the shower everyday.
40212,You must have worked hard for that! I'm sure it's great and you'll pass with a flying color!
40213,"Yeah, such a relief to get a huge project done. You must feel proud!"
40214,That must be really irritating. Is she doing it deliberately?
40215,"Haha - maybe you'll learn to love it! There must be something good about it, if your sister has any taste."
40216,"I've never been abroad before, but I'm going to spend two weeks in France next month!"
40217,I am going to visit a few cities and tourist attractions.
40218,"Oh no, did they get angry? "
40219,"Okay, I am glad that they were not angry. and I am sure they knew it was unintentional so don't feel too guilty about it. :) "
40220,"Wow you are very trusting, I do not think I would allow a friend to borrow my car. Is it legal for him to drive with just a permit? "
40221,"Oh okay I see, I thought you actually lent him your car and let him drive around town with it by himself! "
40222,That's a big decision! What are your choices?
40223,If you want my advice - choose something you're going to enjoy. I personally couldn't be a nurse - too messy!
40224,I hoep you reach your goal. It must be tiring.
40225,Don't give up. Things may not be great one day but they always pick up eventually.
40226,that stinks were you guys going school clothes shopping?
40227,"That's good, school shopping is always stressful for me"
40228,okey no problem
40229,For mine too. That was also i said.
40230,I understand completely. One has to live within one's budget. It can be hard though.
40231,It's only normal to want to live within one's means. Too bad you can't leave a tip every time.
40232,Wow ! Thats quite unfortunate!
40233,Well handle it wisely
40234,"It sounds like a stressful day. You have to just live in the present so, you will not be too stress out."
40235,When that is over then you can do you. We have to make time for ourselves.
40236,I'm very sorry for your loss. Thinking about and remember all of your good memories with her may help.
40237,That's a good way to remember her and keep her close to your heart.
40238,"Yes, it does. "
40239,That can't be easy. How old are your children? Sometimes I wish we could keep our kids small forever!
40240,"Yeah you want them to learn, but it's definitely hard to see them doing things that you might not agree with. "
40241,"Wow that's really scary! Labor is a really terrifying thing, especially when something like that happens. Did everything turn out okay?"
40242,I can imagine. When I was in the hospital with my 3 year old they lost all his vitals as well. Kids like to keep us on our toes from the start!
40243,What platform do you play it on? PC or PS4?
40244,PC is the way to go for gaming. That sounds like an awesome type of game. Is it multiplayer?
40245,That's so cute. How old is she?
40246,Oh mine. That is not cute.
40247,That's no good. Did you go to the doctor?
40248,Got to make sure you take care of your self. It's scary when your heat sensitive.
40249,It will be okay. We sometimes do things that we regret.
40250,You have to forgive ourselves. We don't need others validation.
40251,Will you be able to spend more time with her?
40252,"I can imagine, but it's good that her hard work is about to pay off."
40253,What'd MS?
40254,"Well ,I pray you get through it"
40255,How do you feel about that ?
40256,Hopefully she re considers you should talk to her about it
40257,"That is risky, what do you plan to do"
40258,Okey if she is no cause for alarm
40259,Good. You sound confident. When is it?
40260,I'm sure you'll do great then!
40261,"Oh how sweet, high school days is always fun"
40262,Yes it does happen
40263,"am sorry to hear that, may he rest in peace"
40264,I hope you getting better now
40265,Oh no! I'm sorry. Is she going to be ok?
40266,Oh man. Don't feel guilty accidents happen. Hopefully she recovers quickly.
40267,Thats great what is your favorite meal?
40268,That sounds so good i love steaks
40269,"It can been nerve-wracking to start a new job. But I'm sure you did well, right?"
40270,It's wise to be careful but suspecting people all the time may not be healthy. You need to build a good relationship with your new co-workers.
40271,I know exactly how you feel. I have a crazy addiction to soda.  I don't think I can quit!
40272,Maybe try to slowly quit? Like just drink one less a day
40273,Oh the wait is terrible.  What type of job?
40274,Oh no! That is not good! Hopefully you were able to get them out. 
40275,LOL! I'm sure. Don't be too rough on them.
40276,Why couldn't you sleep?
40277,I hope so! Why are you stressed?
40278,"Oh, that sounds uncomfortable. How did you play it?"
40279,"I respect that, I think it shows character and honor. I'm hoping something rewarding comes your way."
40280,"Oh geez, thats not good.  Was he bothering anyone?"
40281,I dont blame you.  I probably would have done the same thing.
40282,"I remember that feeling with my daughter, it is indescribable."
40283,There is nothing to compare it to. I wish I hadn't been waking from anesthesia in that moment so I could have been more awake. 
40284,Oh no! It happens to the best of us :) Have you talked to her about it when you remembered?
40285,Awww I'm sure she completely understood and really appreciated you reaching out and going to visit her!
40286,"Oh, how cool! Dd you and your dad play together?"
40287,That's great. It'll be wonderful to relive those happy moments in the present maybe with your family.
40288,"Wow, that is scary. Were you nervous?"
40289,It sounds like a great experience!
40290,How did you feel when he gave it away? 
40291,Yeah I would have been too. As a nine year old kid that's hard to deal with. 
40292,Ouch! Was it a serious fall?
40293,"That's a relatively quick recovery, fortunately. "
40294,Oh my.. that must have been very sad. I can't even imagine how you must have felt. 
40295,I'm so sorry.! But I'm really glad you've got those pleasant memories and the memento to hold on to so you can remember her fondly. 
40296,"Wow that's great, you must have put a lot of work into your yard."
40297,"Cool, I guess the grass is actually greener in your yard now!"
40298,Ooh nice. That does sound like alot of fun. Do you guys play any sport while your there? 
40299,"Cool. Well enjoy, I hope the weather hold up."
40300,"Yeah, I haven't seen my friends in forever. We don't even live in the same state anymore."
40301,I understand that feeling. I've had trouble letting go of those kind of cravings too. Has your diet been going well otherwise?
40302,"Wow, congratulations! Sugar is one of the hardest things to kick, I don't have the knack for it either, but still you're making great progress!"
40303,Oh no!  It always seems like things get lost when you move doesn't it?  Is there anyway you can go back and see if its at your old place?
40304,It will probably be where you least expect it!
40305,Oh wow.  How did she do?
40306,That's awesome!  That's great exercise! 
40307,"Oh, no! That's so terrible!"
40308,"I'm so sorry that happened! I'm glad she's okay, though."
40309,That is a great sister. I'm sorry you were feeling down
40310,I am glad you are feeling better now
40311,That must've been scary! Did you freak out?
40312,Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. At least you both survived the flight. 
40313,Oh I bet you were pretty upset. Did you guys reschedule?
40314,Haha good! I'm glad that one went well.
40315,It's always nice to visit home. Did your parents enjoy your visit?
40316,Ha ha! I bet. Dogs are the best. I bet he missed you just as much as they did.
40317,What makes you want to get softer wheels? Are those harder to skateboard on?
40318,I didn't know that about softer wheels! Maybe in the future you can change to those.
40319,Oh neat!  How did the little one handle it?
40320,Oh no!  Poor baby must have been really stressed out. 
40321,Oh no!  Hopefully its just the flu.  What did they say?
40322,That's good!  I hope she gets to feeling better soon.  The flu is no fun.
40323,Congratulations! I bet she is excited and hopefully you are excited for her. 
40324,Oooo!!! That is so awesome! Will you be in her wedding party?
40325,"I love kitten, but I can't have one where I live. I bet it is so cute"
40326,Do you plan on getting one
40327,oh man. i hate that. we've had some pretty nasty storms come through Austin in the last few months and luckily i've managed to be in some random parking garage out shopping or eating when they've rolled through.
40328,lol. well that's no good. cleaning garages bites. 
40329,i guess in your field of work you would run across terms and methods which are unfamiliar
40330,"you'll find some like that, not much you can do"
40331,How long did it take you to get your promotion?
40332,I bet that your bosses will give you the long over promotion. I will keep my fingers crossed for you. Good luck!
40333,That's wonderful! Do you have a charity in mind yet?
40334,I bet it will feel amazing to have them cheering you on! I have a feeling you'll do great in your race.
40335,That's wonderful! Where are you guys going to go?
40336,I'm glad you guys had a good time. Are you planning another trip?
40337,Where is it that you go to go home? 
40338,That's awesome. I love going back to my hometown to visit as well. It's nice to see family you don't see every day.
40339,"wow. like, very first? or just the start of the year?"
40340,how did he like it? how did you do?
40341,Oh boy!!   WHat is the test over?    
40342,"Japanese language seems like it would be heard to learn.  Good luck on your test, Im sure you will do fine."
40343,"great, i hope you get the job."
40344,so you were really prepared. 
40345,"That's cool, good movies have a way of tapping into those feelings."
40346,Sometimes it almost makes me want to go back somehow. But it's also important to move forward.
40347,oh that is so wrong. How are you handling it?
40348,"that's good you do that, I would be very frustrated too. That's really unfair. Can you pursue legal charges?"
40349,Oh I bet that was fun. What kind of dog do you have?
40350,"My husband was gone all weekend buying us a new puppy, so I understand feeling lonely! "
40351,"Ugh, I bet that is really frustrating. Is it making it difficult to do your job?"
40352,That makes for long days at work. I hope they can fix it for you soon.
40353,"Omg, I bet they come home so spoiled."
40354,"Yeah, what the heck I don't remember my mom being so nice when I was a kid! lol"
40355,That's sad to hear. What's his prognosis?
40356,Hopefully medical technology will catch up to where it needs to be for him. 
40357,Oh no! I used to be a financial advisor so I'm sure that was frustrating. I hope you didn't lose too much money!
40358,"As much as I hate they didn't go up in price for you, I'm so happy that you didn't overdo it."
40359,Oh yuck! I'm sorry that that happened. What kind of dog is he? Is he sick?
40360,Hopefully it was just a bad day for him and he won't do it again! I have a couple rescue mutts as well. 
40361,That's great! Do you get a chance to learn new languages often?
40362,"My ex programs for insurance companies and they all use the same, ancient language for their statistics. She hasn't had to learn anything new for decades."
40363,holy moly thats great i cant ever walk normal
40364,That is wonderful! So you will be on a vacation? Will you be going alone? 
40365,You will be having fun in the sun. Nothing like a day at beach.
40366,"Yea, once I vacationed on a Caribbean island, Lovely beaches, food and drinks."

40379,That's awesome! Did you show them to your sister after you found them?
40380,Oh no! What happened to your laptop? if you get a new one which one are you looking at?
40381,"Ouch, What a pain that is! I can imagine, i would be the exact same in that situation."

40394,That was really sweet of them. Glad he got a treat to cheer him up.
40395,I've done one of those before. They are pretty cool. Do you think you will get the job?
40396,"I'm sorry to hear that. I'll pray for you if that's okay and  then maybe you will get it, but if not, maybe something even better will come along."
40397,Great. And you're very welcome. I enjoy praying for other people.
40398,Sorry to hear that. There are no alternatives?

40406,"That's great I have pretty much all of the ones I had in my childhood, even the Atari."
40407,Anything you need!! I'm here for you!
40408,"Don't sweat it, it happened to me in my mid 20's also. Couldn't even tell ya how or why, just that it did."
40409,"LOL I don't think so. I think you'll be fine, maybe you were just extra tired."
40410,Lol! I don't think i would trust that concoction if i were you.
40411,Well then. Kudos to uncle Jeb!

40415,"that is dangerous, glad that both of your are okay"
40416,"Okay, well if you have it then you would have to see a doctor."
40417,"Now that is interesting, I wish you the best of luck."
40418,Oh really? Are you afraid of missing out on something?
40419,Well it is good to have extra food on hand these days. You never know what major event can happen.
40420,"Oh my! Is she ok, and was it while surfing?"
40421,"Did you recover the leg? And I once almost got my finger bit off by a snapping turtle, it wasn't a pleasant experience so I couldn't imagine hers. You are great for staying there."
40422,How could you? Oh dear now you would have to apologise
40423,I am glad that you were able to reschedule
40424,I am sure that was an interesting conversation.  What did your friend think?
40425,Lol   I think that even the people who like him would agree with that
40426,That must have really been a wonderful surprise!
40427,Yeah childhood ends way too fast it's great when we have a chance to reflect on them.
40428,"Nice, the windy city! Had you been before?"
40429,Ive never been but would love to go one day! Ah no what was wrong?
40430,"Aww, that is nice. Where did you study abroad?"
40431,"Wow, how exciting! I also traveled Europe and Italy many years ago. I loved it!! Wish I could just move there. :)"
40432,Wow that's incredible. What was her anme?
40433,Haha thats really funny. I bet she was a special person.
40434,I am too! What are your plans?
40435,"I've been to Universal and everything else around there, but sadly never during halloween, I've always wanted to."
40436,"That's rare these days, I was with mine for 7"
40437,I hope you at least got a severance package!
40438,Was it a bad one? And did she find out?
40439,Sometimes the lies get so heavy you just crack. Good for you though.
40440,I know how hard that can be. Is it working out?
40441,It does take a lot of stress off of you.
40442,"I hope you are ok, what happened?"
40443,"I can believe so , Hope you get justice, and a paycheck!"
40444,That's always fun! Did you get anything cool?
40445,YAY! I think shoes are a great gift.
40446,"Nice, how did it go? Was the guy nice?"
40447,That's great! Did you get the job?
40448,That sucks. Do you know what caused the outage?
40449,You don't realize how dependent we are on electricity until the lights go out.
40450,Oh nice! That seems more likely than winning the state lottery. That would be so cool if you won!
40451,That sounds like a really nice program. Where can I buy some tickets?!
40452,Were they a close friend? And did you pay them with pizza?
40453,"I had a shoulder injury when i last moved, except I had to pay movers and pretend they were my friends for a day."
40454,Sorry to hear that. What would you do if you won it?
40455,It is good to dream. Dreams can come true. :)
40456,"Oh , was it good? I've considered it."
40457,"Only if you are choosing that, over real tangible moments with friends or outside people."
40458,"That would take a miracle , or have some major money backing it."
40459,"Take some small steps and vote in other things for people with the right values, not just pandering to the ignorant."
40460,"Im sorry to hear that, how long did you have him?"
40461,"Yeah that is a long time for a fish, do you have plans to get another one"
40462,"I hate when that happens, They expect us to be on point every time, yet they can't bother. I usually decline anything after."
40463,oh no! Did you lose a lot of work?
40464,I can relate. I have lost whole essays for the same reason. I had to call in sick for school because of it.
40465,im a browns fan i feel that pain
40466,yea me too it sucks
40467,You should probably go to the doctor about that
40468,You could have a tear on your eye. You really should get it checked out 
40469,"I bet that was fun, who did you go see?"
40470,Magic is such a cool thing. That suspension of belief.
40471,oh that's wonderful! Is it a job that you would enjoy?
40472,that's great! I hope you do well and get the job. good luck!
40473,"That is good, what are you going to do to celebrate"
40474,"that is always good, have one for me!"
40475,"Aww, that was sweet of her. Does she do that often for you?"
40476,That's wonderful. It's nice to have someone in life who cares for your well being.
40477,Oh wow. How far away did you move??
40478,"Awww! I know they miss you, too. I hope you're finding some fun with living on your own too!"
40479,"I feel you. Last week, I spend 1000 dollars to fix my daughter's teeth. Dentists ask a lot of money now a days."
40480,Ohh well that's good for you. These kind people always help in difficult times.
40481,sounds good so far
40482,thats a great feeling

40486,thats always super
40487,I bet that gave you some good feeelings
40488,Yeah I bet. but atleast you have the memorys
40489,O no! Can you fix it?
40490,Well it is not hard to build a mailbox im sure you can do it
40491,now thats some super news
40492,That is awesome! I bet your happy about that
40493,Oh my gosh! How many did you adopt?!
40494,"Oh, I see! What a lovely surprise though. What did you do with her litter?"
40495,Yeah it is hard to leave our animals behind
40496,That is nice of her!
40497,Aww that's so cute! Did he enjoy it?
40498,"Poor guy was just nervous, I'm sure the more you take him the more he will venture away from you and have some fun!"
40499,"Well hopefully he is understanding, if he is anything like my brother nothing a cold 6 pack won't fix."
40500,"All is well that ends well, especially with family they gotta give ya do overs."
40501,That is a great idea! how is it so far?
40502,Yeah you will improve yourself and feel good about it
40503,"That's good, did you have to wait there or were you able to go home?"
40504,Haha that;s rare when it comes to mechanics.
40505,"im sorry, thats awful. its a shame his parents arent being more supportive"
40506,im sure he appreciates having you around though
40507,That was really nice of them. I bet you're appreciative.
40508,I'm sure you'll do a favor for them in the future.
40509,"Yikes! That is terrible! What a awful thing to do! I am glad he finally got busted! Wow, for years, huh?"
40510,"Yeah, me either. Hopefully they regret what they did and are able to learn something from this."
40511,"I enjoyed highschool, too."
40512,"College was pretty laid back for me, I did a lot of online classes."
40513,I am sorry for your loss. I hope you can find comfort during this difficult time.
40514,"You will, and that is what gives us the strength to face tomorrow!"
40515,"Happens to everybody. My girlfriend, who is the smartest person I know, has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because she's locked herself out so much. She's so forgetful because she's so efficient and on top of everything else important, that sometimes she misses the small things. Maybe that's true in your case, too!"
40516,"I've heard some people place theirs in a bowl near the front door as soon as they come home, or they stick it in the fridge with their lunch.. silly things to make sure they can keep it together."
40517,Wow. That must be a very special friend. I net you were surprised.
40518,Oh dear. Maybe he is a loner and doesn't like friends.
40519,oh that's just a recipe for disaster 100% of the time.
40520,mine has too. i think you did the right thing by not getting involved.
40521,"Hm, who might that be? "
40522,Thats neat. You must trust him a lot given his track record of making money!
40523,Oh my goodness!  That's amazing!  Congratulations! Was it your first gold medal race?
40524,That is awesome! It is for running?
40525,That sounds exciting and scary.  What was the surprise?
40526,"That is so awesome.  Did you have fun? and more important, are you a pilot now?"
40527,"That's cool, did it bring back some good memories? "
40528,"I love the 90's also, best decade in my opinion!"
40529,"Oh no, did you get hurt?"
40530,"Yikes, I'm sorry to hear that.  That sounds horrifying!"
40531,So what did you do?
40532,"Well, I bet your friend had a good time with you being there. Sometimes we have to make sacrefices for those we care about."
40533,I'm sorry. My wife could sympathize with you since I'm gone a lot on business as well. 
40534,I'm sorry you feel lonely.  My wife says she ofens feels the same way.  I know your husband misses you awfully while he's away.  I love having chats with my wife every day when I'm gone.
40535,Just be confident and you will do great!
40536,You got this! 
40537,"Ah, yeah moving can be hectic! Are you moving somewhere you want to be?"
40538,"That's a positive at least, good luck on the move!"
40539,Oh no!!! Did you see what happened to the dog?!
40540,That's so sad! What on earth is a dog doing around a highway?! That just breaks my heart.. 
40541,I can understand the anxiety. Its a whole new different experience for first timers!
40542,Same thing happens to me. I sometimes faint at the sight of a needle! Its good that your experience went well! Now you wont be nervous anymore. 
40543,Aww! That is so cute! Has he done something special this week that made him extra sweet?
40544,That is so sweet of him. Its definitely the little things. 
40545,Good! What's been going on?
40546,Woo! Congrats on that! That's always a nice surprise. What do you do?
40547,Yeah exactly!  Music is awesome.  
40548,Yeah he sounds amazing.  Sorry for your loss friend :(
40549,"Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler, everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did, I'd consider using it again, or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm, you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else, there should be no shame."
40550,"Well, if I were you, I'd keep it up, whether or not my spouse laughed at me, or a new girlfriend/boyfriend, whatever. It's not childish to me. Life is stressful enough. Let us snuggle what we want."
40551,"Aw! That's horrible, I'm sorry to hear that."
40552,"That's so sad, I don't even know what to say!"
40553,"Oh no! That is really creepy, why is he in your backyard?"
40554,"Yeah, that's illegal I think, they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!"
40555,I am so sorry to hear that. It can't be easy for you and your family.
40556,No doubt it will take time to process. I wish your family the best. Stay strong my friend.
40557,What shows are your favorite? That must be nice.
40558,"Must be nice, got any nice snacks?"
40559,Good choice. You're health is more important than some grad degree. 
40560,I think nowadays employers just want experience. So it should be easier once you have that. 
40561,"Ah, I hate when that happens! How embarrassed were you?"
40562,Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you're not seriously hurt! 
40563,"You're sweet, what kind of soup did you make him?"
40564,"I love chicken noodle, he must be so grateful."
40565,I bet that was a little embarrassing.
40566,I am sure it was not as bad as you think. 
40567,Wow! What kind of meeting is it?
40568,Dang! I hope you have successful meeting then!
40569,"Oh no, was it romantic texts?"
40570,That's sad. I hope you are OK.
40571,That must be weird to talk to your ex still.
40572,You must have feelings for him that are lingering.
40573,Nice! It feels good to be confident. When do they come out?
40574,As you should. You must have good teachers too!
40575,why? what happened to it? is it okay?
40576,"that sounds terrible, i hope you didn't cry alot."
40577,Oh yeah?  Do you know someone that lives there?
40578,Yeah.  That's awesome that you do that though.  Makes for some special moments with your daughter and teaches her stuff.
40579,That sounds cool!  I bet she cooks good!
40580,haha same here!  
40581,I am so happy for you that you have someone you can trust so completely.
40582,Hopefully she knows how much this means to you.
40583,DID HE GET ACCEPTED? I HOPE SO
40584,"OMG that's amazing, good on him! you must be so proud"
40585,"oh wow, how did your mother handle this, how did you handle it . i can only imagine the pain."
40586,"that is really painful, i hope everything becomes better soon."
40587,where did he go study at? i can imagine how hard that could be. but it's good to see him following his dreams\
40588,aerospace engineer that sounds very interesting. hopefully he will stay focused and reach his goals.
40589,"aww that's amazing, i am going on vacation next week and i can't wait"
40590,i know! i am sure you were able to recharge your batteries 
40591,Do you have any special welcome-back events planned?
40592,That sounds great. Does he travel often?
40593,How exciting! I hope everything goes as planned!
40594,Sounds like you have a good relationship. I hope when I get married it turns out just as good.
40595,aww. im sure you must feel proud of him
40596,that sounds so cute
40597,that is good news. its always good when what you learn helps you get ahead
40598,i hope you do well and excell
40599,An adult did this? 
40600,I dont get people sometimes. Who does that that sort of thing.
40601,"Aww, they grow up so fast!!  How did she do?"
40602,"haha, I'm sorry you were so upset for nothing!  But it's so great that she loves school.  I hope she loves learning her whole life."
40603,"That is all that matters, its about the love."
40604,I understand. Did you told your friend?
40605,"Wow, it is terrible."
40606,Did you go see who it was?
40607,No that's scary stuff.
40608,That is great. What is it fun?
40609,That is always difficult.
40610,I am single and never been married. I assume arguments are part of marriage.
40611,Im bad at giving advice especially to people I dont know. Im the opposite. Im too mellow. And that sometimes gets me in trouble.
40612,In some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house.
40613,I hope you aren't still scared of your shadow?
40614,I don't think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like you're generous regularly.  I get it though.
40615,It's hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!
40616,Children are a beautiful thing for us parents. What a great memory you have of that. 
40617,"Thats perfect, a boy and a girl thats what most people want. congrats. "
40618,In what do you believe?
40619,That is great. In what do your colleagues believe?
40620,What car did you buy?
40621,Jeez. Where do you live? I dont remember any state Ive been to with bad drivers.
40622,Good luck! My sister-in-law has been with weight watchers for a while now. She loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other.
40623,You'll reach your goal. You just have to make small adjustments which'll sustain you throughout your life. How many meetings do you attend?
40624,That test seems so hard. I probably couldn't even pass it. How did you do?
40625,I didn't know that. Congratulations. That's so awesome.
40626,That must have been nice. I keep cards too.
40627,"Of course not. There is so much paper in this house. I keep cards, photos, school projects. Everything. We arent here forever"
40628,I found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed. I think they passed down their hoarding to us lol
40629,Lol. Me too!!
40630,Why was it slippery
40631,"Oh no, were you okay"
40632,Oh no. Why are you keeping the secret?
40633,Oh it sounds like you are in a difficult situation. I hope you can get out of the middle of it!
40634,Oh I am sorry. Did you get any part?
40635,I am glad you got a good part. I am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though.
40636,"That is wonderful, I imagine she is very excited."
40637,"Okay i see well, take your time she will be getting her liscense soon"
40638,She just needs to get her confidence and I am sure you are a great teacher.
40639,It will definitely paid off and I am rooting for her.
40640,That can be overwhelming. Are you going to be cleaning all day then?
40641,I'm sure you will get it done!
40642,Thats neat. Do you guys make a lot of money?
40643,I wish my siblings were like that. We should be more supportive and close like that
40644,I am jealous lol
40645,I will work on it with my family. 
40646,Wow!  It sounds like your kid is quite smart and gifted!  You must be really proud of him!
40647,"Man, that is amazing that both your kids are so talented.  I hope my little ones are like that.  Congrats on your great parenting!"
40648,Are you able to learn the route first before you have to take it for your job or are they kind of just throwing you into it?
40649,Well hopefully you're able to familiarize yourself quickly. Good luck!
40650,Thats sad. Have you been to Scotand since?
40651,Im sorry to hear that. Were you born there?
40652,96! Wow. Thats a full life!
40653,Wow. She probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that.
40654,Excellent! Are you enjoying it?
40655,Sick. I hope it's as fun as it looks!
40656,I am glad that she is living close to you. That must make you feel special. My mom is dead so I understand how you feel.
40657,I am happy that your mom is still around. Cherish the days that you spend together.
40658,are they typically bad or something?
40659,"Oh that makes sense, well enjoy the peace and quiet!"
40660,Thats awesome. What did you guys do?
40661,that sounds fun!
40662,Poor thing! What did you do?   Did you take it home with you?
40663,"eww,  that is great you took such great care of him.  "
40664,That 's nice of you.  Did you keep it as a pet
40665,Cool.  Some birds shouldn't be in captivity.  What kind of bird was it
40666,That is a nerve-racking experience. But I'm betting you did graduate and did just fine!
40667,Congratulations! Waiting for results can be very stressful - everything's out of your hands and all you can do is wait.
40668,"I'm sure she understands, just tell the truth!"
40669,"Yeah, I'd be pretty scared too, but it's better to be upfront about it to get it off your chest"
40670,Oh boy. Did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress?
40671,Everyone looks good in a dress. Just make sure to shave first.
40672,"Oh man, I did too.  I still do every once in a while but only when I'm having trouble sleeping.  Does one stand out from the rest that you remember vividly?"
40673,Creepy! I once had a dream of a Lion laying at the end of my bad. It was scary but also comforting.  I feel like I could've touched it. Glad you're free of those dreams now.
40674,So you probably felt pretty guilty huh. Did you return what you stole?
40675,Glad to hear you stopped with your wayward habits before the Po Po caught up with you!
40676,"I've always liked the idea of meditation, but I feel like it'd be hard. My mind is always racing!"
40677,"Awesome, I'll check that out! I hear all sorts of great things about meditation."
40678,"Me too, do you have any special plans?"
40679,How fun! yes I am sure they will have  a great time!
40680,Is it for college?
40681,"Well good luck, I hope you get in!"
40682,I love cooking! What types of things do you like to cook?
40683,I am also a vegetarian and I love cooking Italian food.
40684,Those are so much fun. Was everyone hype?
40685,Tight. Probably wont be able to do that again!
40686,"Oh my gosh, so tiny. I'm hoping since he was released from the hospital he is doing well now?"
40687,I can imagine. I'm glad to hear he's better! Life is such a gift.
40688,That is really nice that you guys have that trust.
40689,That is an awesome goal! Good luck!
40690,I hope it didn't mess up your clothes. I'm sure it was a mistake.
40691,I'm glad it didn't mess anything up and that your relationship with your sister is still in tact.
40692,Oh no. I rent also so I know your pain. My last landlord was awful.  How did your landlord react?
40693,"Oh good, glad he did that instead of just coming down on your for not paying.  Glad it worked out for you."
40694,Lucky you did that in time!
40695,Sounds like it worked out great for you!
40696,Wow! You should do something back for her!
40697,"Nice, I am jealous of your friendship!"
40698,Was it something important that you took ?
40699,"I see, did they ever find out it was you ?"
40700,"That is awful, I am sorry to hear that.  Is he doing better now?"
40701,I'm so glad he is better.  Is the whole family doing alright?  I know that can be really hard on people.
40702,"Life was easier back then, Hopefully you still love life?"
40703,Nostalgia can stir emotions. You'll find something to love about life again.
40704,"Oh, no!  What happened?  Did she just get loose?  "
40705,"Thankfully, they are both okay.  Dogs or cars, or anything for that matter could get them!"
40706,That is embarrassing. I would hate to have that happen.
40707,That is the best way to handle those situations.
40708,Ouch! I can relate. What made you decide to drink a whole gallon in a day?
40709,Haha! I hope you experience no seriously ill effects!
40710,"Sheesh that is brutal, did you smack him?"
40711,"I don't blame you, that is low."
40712,"Me neither, I hate it when they just wont leave you alone"
40713,Yes! I feel the same
40714,"Always try to brush your teeth at least twice a day, it helps"
40715,If you don't take care of your teeth then you will have a bad time later in life
40716,"That is bizarre, have you had this seen about?"
40717,"That is odd, are you afraid when you wake up?"
40718,You sound a lot like my husband. He is really into going to the gym. Life isnt right if he doesnt get gym time.
40719,I agree. Its pretty cool to see the changes. I never really got into going to the gym though. 
40720,"I have been skydiving, too! It was a fun experience."
40721,"I lost my hearing for a few hours after though, but other than that it was a wonderful experience."
40722,"That is great, did something recently happen?"
40723,Awesome! What type of music?
40724,What possibilities do you speak of?
40725,That sounds pretty exciting.
40726,I've never been much for meditating. I'm glad you enjoy it.
40727,What got you into meditation?
40728,I think that's a good idea so you aren't always dependent on others to have fun and just enjoy time to yourself.
40729,Meditation on goals and positive ideas during some of that alone time can be so uplifting and refocuses you.
40730,"I used to struggle with the same problem, it can be overwhelming"
40731,I agree!!
40732,Grats.  How long have you been working out for?
40733,Keep your diet clean and you'll keep improving.
40734,That sounds nice. Hopefully it isn't too hot for you.
40735,Are you going to be sleeping in a tent?
40736,That's just so sad. House fires are terrifying to me.
40737,The wiring was probably old and not up to code anymore.
40738,did it go flat?
40739,that is very fortunate!
40740,That is really nice of you!  Is the cat OK now?
40741,"That's good.  If not for you, who knows what could have happened.  You must be a very caring individual."
40742,I think that is a lovely thing
40743,"If its important, you will figure it out"
40744,"Yea, its a good idea to take time for yourself when you can"
40745,I think relaxing is very important
40746,Yeah as a child it's hard to see other kids with a bunch of friends when you don't have that many.
40747,"Well, I hope you got over that issue and ended up making lots of friends yourself."
40748,"Oh man! thats impressive, those baths are rough."
40749,That's good. But still! You must be pretty tough!
40750,Are you taking protein?
40751,"That is good, hopefully it helps!"
40752,"I agree, were you recently screwed by one?"
40753,Yep its disgusting
40754,"That is sweet of you, kids are cute"
40755,"Oh that is not good, I hope you were able to clean it up easily..."
40756,Wow I haven't thought of them in years.  Sometimes it is good to have bands you can always go back to
40757,True.  I have favorite bands to that I consider to be musical comfort food
40758,Nice! Are you getting a car soon too?
40759,"Definitely, especially when you get really hungry at night. I love a good drive thru"
40760,That is awful. I've had it happen to me once before.
40761,"I sure hope so, too! It is a lot of work to get it sorted out. "
40762,"Yeah... that seems like a hard gig, especially in today's day and age, where everyone's so wary, and especially since there's not often people at home during the day. You have to have good people skills to do that job, though. So, you at least probably have that going for you."
40763,"Ah.. yeah, I'm sorry you had to run into that kind of problem. It's hard doing a job you don't agree with the ethics of. There's really no way to fake it sometimes. But at least you were able to realize that and stand by your morals."
40764,Is he going out drinking?
40765,"That is such a tough time, my son is teething as well"
40766,Well I am not a religious person but I will have to say it urks me when I am surronded my religious people that is trying to push their belief on me. Then seeing them feel people heads with stuff that they can not prove is there irritates me also
40767,Lol. exactly how I feel
40768,"Oh, thats not unusual. You must try to relax. Is it an important presentation?"
40769,"I see, I hope it goes well for you. Remember to breathe! "
40770,That is a scary situation. People do not care anymore.
40771,You are so right! 
40772,"That is awesome, what degree are you working towards?"
40773,"I can imagine, waiting sucks!"
40774,That's kind of odd. I probably would have tried to take a swing just out of pure instinct. What was the reason they wanted to wake you up?
40775,"Hahaha.. that's kind of goofy in a way. Yeah, sometimes nothing good can come of people trying to get your attention randomly in the middle of the night. That's probably the wisest choice. I probably wouldn't be able to act that good enough to pull it off."
40776,Ouch!  What did you take?
40777,Was it an awesome keyboard worth getting in trouble for?
40778,Congrats! Thats so exciting do You fel ok?
40779,YAY! good job! He/she is going to be beautiful
40780,"I still think it is, i always get so excited"
40781,yep thats one of the things that make it so nice
40782,Oh wow that is weird. Did you say anything to him?
40783,"Yeesh, how awkward is that."
40784,Were you able to take the plate id?
40785,I understand. Sorry to hear about that.
40786,Oh nice. What kind of candy was it?
40787,Oh yeah I think I have tried that one! I love anything by Haribro! 
40788,Glad to hear it. I hate hearing about children having tragic childhoods and not being able to just simply be a kid. But at least she'll have a good perspective and appreciate life more.
40789,"Even if she does, it will help make her a well-rounded, relatable person. Usually these things help ground kids and give them character. But maybe you're right, if she moves on from it quickly, that's great too!"
40790,What had he made in the world?
40791,"That's super cool, I played a few years back but eventually quit."
40792,I am really sorry to hear that.  I hope everything is alright.
40793,"Well, that is just terrible.  I hate it when companies jerk you around like that.  I hope you will be able to reschedule it, although I know that wouldn't make up for the frustration."
40794,that is a great way to look at it
40795,Yeah more people should look at life like you do
40796,did you call the exterminator?
40797,I live in Texas to so i know those feels
40798,What is the test on?
40799,"Chemistry is quite difficult,have you studied hard?"
40800,Are you fine now?
40801,Cool :) Is your car damaged a lot?
40802,"That's funny, hope he didn't give you a heart attack."
40803,I would probably scream also.
40804,Wow! That sounds amazing. Where are you going? 
40805,You are going to love it I am sure. Safe Travels! 
40806,"Thats horrible, hope he is ok."
40807,"I see, glad he is ok."
40808,"Hi, how are you?"
40809,"That was kind of you, I am sure they appreciated that!"
40810,My last vacation went horribly wrongQ!
40811,Yes I love to reminice
40812,Im sorry to hear that. I have never had a dog. What was your experience of the dog?
40813,I am really sorry to hear that. What was the dogs name?
40814,Hello How are you and what is your story chat about today? 
40815,OMG wow.... i hope you got it open quick! 
40816,"Hi, a few months ago, my mother found some stray dogs that were starving, so she told us about them. Of course, we brought the poor babies to our house, a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them, as their ribs were showing, but they were still so loving and sweet."
40817,"Yes, I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets, so I wasn't going to keep them, but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them, with the puppies being able to stay together."
40818,That is really nice to see... I bet it made you feel good! So sweet. 
40819,Nice to still see that behavior in todays world. :)
40820,"Thats sweet that you remember that, how old were you? "
40821,I wont make you reveal your age! lol :p 
40822,That's wonderful. How long have you guys been dating?
40823,Time flies by pretty fast. Could be together 10 years from now!
40824,congratualtions. what do you do?
40825,oh wow. we're practically neighbors.
40826,How big was the deck?
40827,Wow that is big.
40828,What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.
40829,"Oh wow, I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon."
40830,Thats great. Did you create the script?
40831,I love google. It is my favorite search engine.
40832,Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear? 
40833,Well I hope he has 100 more years to go! :) 
40834,Have you tried to call her?
40835,Maybe give her space.
40836,What birthstone is it.
40837,What birthstone is it?
40838,I love to play Madden.
40839,"Yes, every day."
40840,Where is she?
40841,Just give her space.
40842,Thats great.
40843,Did you teach her?
40844,Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!
40845,That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat. 
40846,Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!
40847,"Wow, 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.  "
40848,Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? 
40849,I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. 
40850,"That sounds fun, I was never any good at painting"
40851,That probably helps a good deal!
40852,I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!
40853,"That is terrible, he could have hurt the horse!"
40854,"Nice, congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?"
40855,"Awesome, I hope the job goes great for you!"
40856,"Thats sad, hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you"
40857,"Haha thats crazy, I hope they became best friends, I love cats."
40858,I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!
40859,Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.
40860,An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.
40861,I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.
40862,Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?
40863,Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.
40864,That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!
40865,"Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So, how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?"
40866,"Yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen."
40867,Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.
40868,"It sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?"
40869,"That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at, or still looking?"
40870,I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.
40871,She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!
40872,"I am very nostalgic too, that must be a fun time!"
40873,"That is true, but it is part of life, but it is cool to see things again, regain perspective"
40874,I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.
40875,"Yes, sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!"
40876,I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life
40877,"True, and the good thing is that when the kids grow, they provide moral support to parents."
40878,Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!
40879,Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!
40880,"Is he a stay at home father, or does he just not want to work?"
40881,I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.
40882,"Must of been pretty surprised, Also great to have friends like that."
40883,That must of just made everything even better!
40884,That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.
40885,You are very lucky
40886,"No I haven't actually, I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though. "
40887,"I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time, but if I do I will definitely check it out!"
40888,Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?
40889,Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.
40890,"Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations, which of course only makes it worse!"
40891,"What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know, like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead, playing ""your"" song?"
40892,You should not be so insecure like that.
40893,What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?
40894,"yes, several times.The place is magical."
40895,"Well, you are about to have the fun of your life, but gamble responsible."
40896,Why. Did you started dating recently or something
40897,The most important thing is what you want.
40898,Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?
40899,Are you still competing on a professional level?
40900,"NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously, I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!"
40901,Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?
40902,Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!
40903,I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!
40904,I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?
40905,That's great for her. 
40906,hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?
40907,OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?
40908,That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?
40909,Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!
40910,I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?
40911,"Maybe one day if you have the time, you can pay him a surprise visit."
40912,That is good. Where you running late
40913,That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind
40914,"I don't think you should feel bad, you didn't know!"
40915,I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.
40916,Sounds like a good idea.
40917,Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do! 
40918,That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.
40919,Oh that's so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and I'm glad to know her.
40920,"I think it's great that you have such positive memories of her, that way she'll always be there in some form."
40921,"Yes, I love to visit the zoo!  "
40922,What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?
40923,That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.
40924,My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.
40925,That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?
40926,You need to fight your fear
40927,wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!
40928,Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family 
40929,"Yes I do actually, I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once. "
40930,I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened. 
40931,Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!
40932,"I bet, losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!"
40933,Okay that's good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied. 
40934,Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when they're released! 
40935,Oh no! I'll bet that made you feel terrible!
40936,I can see why not! I'm so sorry that happened to you.
40937,That is hilarious. I bet.
40938,Oh my just the opposite LOL
40939,Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.
40940,I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent! 
40941,wow yes it is 
40942,He probably stored that up for his energy for the race
40943,"Haha oh wow, how was that for them"
40944,"Thats great, im glad she did well"
40945,I hate it when that happens! were you ok?
40946,I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.
40947,That sounds nice! DId you have fun
40948,"I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, it is important to make time for family."
40949,I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that
40950,Sounds like the best thing to do honestly
40951,"you will survive, and you have something to look forward to"
40952,i hope your work day goes by fast
40953,Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.
40954,I really hope you didn't have any lasting effects from the injury?
40955,Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?
40956,"Congratulations! Studying can be hard, but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?"
40957,Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!
40958,Ugh! That's the worst! Too bad you couldn't run home and change!
40959,I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.
40960,Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted
40961,Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.
40962,"Yes, I have an Associate's in Nursing."
40963,"Yes, it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!"
40964,"Holy smokes! Let me guess, better for the environment?"
40965,"You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet, but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!"
40966,But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!
40967,"Oh, it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)"
40968,I love the Autobahn.
40969,Yes I use to own an Audio.
40970,"I have never done that, good job."
40971,You should. When is the next one.
40972,Oh wow thats cool.
40973,Thats good you still think of him.
40974,Thats cool. Was it hard?
40975,Wow that is a lot.
40976,What do you get from your mom?
40977,I don't like uninvited guests either! So annoying!
40978,I love dalmatians.
40979,How old was she.
40980,Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled.
40981,Does she have like some other issues like mentally?
40982,I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.
40983,"That is the worse, you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst, happens to me all the time."
40984,"So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had, or have you been unsuccessful?"
40985,"Wow, did they notice?"
40986,They will forget about it soon.
40987,I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?
40988,"That's the worst! You think you can trust people, and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again."
40989,That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?
40990,That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.
40991,"I love Colorado, my favorite state."
40992,I wish I could live there.
40993,Did you fart?
40994,Did they smell?
40995,"Thats good, as long as no one got hurt."
40996,"No training at all!  Wow, that's pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?"
40997,That's still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?
40998,WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.
40999,Wow you are brave.
41000,I bet you drove fast.
41001,"Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it, I don't think."
41002,Have you ever done anything else so frightening?
41003,"I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me, I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!"
41004,At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.
41005,"Love, it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me. "
41006,yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.
41007,Hope so. I don't do well with heights.
41008,"Oh, I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?"
41009,"Well, at least you didn't go down in your grade. But, it wasn't right to treat the students like that!"
41010,"That is good, how old are you?"
41011,I am 31 so same generation.
41012,"Oh gosh, I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know? "
41013,"Wow! In that instance, I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food. "
41014,and did you knock it out of the park? 
41015,Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's. 
41016,Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.
41017,That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.
41018,"Oh, I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?"
41019,I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.
41020,it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.
41021,She had a happy life. I'm sure she understands.
41022,Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?
41023,Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?
41024,That's awesome! What did they talk about?
41025,Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?
41026,Sounds like it was very exciting!
41027,Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.
41028,I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.
41029,I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?
41030,I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!
41031,"It happens to everyone, are you out of it now?"
41032,"Oh well, it was nice to have someone to help you."
41033,I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily
41034,Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.
41035,"yeah, and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them"
41036,"I bet you were, I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse."
41037,I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.
41038,Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
41039,Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life
41040,Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed
41041,"So if not by studying ,what else?"
41042,That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital? 
41043,You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.
41044,That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!
41045,Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!
41046,Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?
41047,When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?
41048,"That's too funny. You know, I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!"
41049,"Yes, someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling"
41050,I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?
41051,"That's sweet, I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!"
41052,"Wow, that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?"
41053,That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!
41054,What was the initial talk?
41055,So how do you feel when lonely?
41056,Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.
41057,"yes, i understood the first time."
41058,"I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt,"
41059,Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.
41060,"Oh dang, talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol"
41061,"That is a hilarious intro, thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things, you have nothing to worry about ;-))"
41062,"These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov, you crazy kids!"
41063,Is that good or bad? Why the concern?
41064,OK why do you think so?
41065,Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem
41066,"I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another, we would not have much problem"
41067,Well you should try to study more and see what happens
41068,Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf
41069,THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.
41070,"That's hilarious, But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?"
41071,"Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared, especially during storms."
41072,I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :) 
41073,You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded. Sorry I'm a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?
41074,Really?  Where do you live at?
41075,"I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando, Florida.  So Im in the same boat."
41076,That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???
41077,I would be scared of a guy like that.
41078,Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show. What hit you the most?
41079,Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I can't imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..
41080,You mean nostalgic?
41081,What your grand father did to you was very special.
41082,"That is not very considerate or respectful, plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street."
41083,"I live in the country, so I do not have neighbors that live close. "
41084,"I sometimes get freaked out, but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors. "
41085,Yes. Peace is key.
41086,Uhmmnn! Cut down on the intake 
41087,You need to see a dentist then
41088,Just all the time.Who does not?
41089,It depends on the machine you are working on.
41090,Do you have a tribal tattoo. How does it look like?
41091,That was bad. You can try some tattoo removal tool
41092,Did you know them well? You must be very trusting.
41093,I think I would have just said I didn't have any cash and let that be the end of it.
41094,Sorry! Try harder next time!
41095,Never late you know!
41096,That sucks. Are they mad or what?
41097,It's kinda annoying to me when people don't call you back.
41098,Serious? Why are you scared when you are in a wreck?
41099,"Wow, you really have to be careful dear."
41100,"Yes I have, it feels really bad when it happens."
41101,Yea it can be quite embarrassing to look back on.
41102,"Come on, you do not have to be jealous of your brother"
41103,You can learnt some skills from your brother. Maybe it will help
41104,Are you trying to go out and meet some ladies 
41105,That is the first step. What you have to do next is be at your best behavior always 
41106,Do you work in the tech industry? You could always take a class.
41107,"There's ton's online, and knowing more about computers can really help any profession."
41108,I am sure it is something disgusting. Do you have someone do it around you
41109,You can just let him know you are not comfortable with it
41110,yes the patient is very ill
41111,oh that is really a bad news i heared
41112,What is it that you would like to share with me? I am very interested to hear about it!
41113,"Whoa, I hope you win! You never know, it could be your lucky day!"
41114,"I know how you feel, I get so scared when exams come up, its so hard sometimes"
41115,Yea open book make you think you dont need to study but that isnt true at all
41116,"Cool, I could not do English."
41117,yea that does seem like a lot of work could you ever handle it?
41118,ooo well that explains a lot. well hopefully he will pass some to you 
41119,Which work are you talking about. it is always a good feeling to get things done. There a way your brain reward you with good feeling 
41120,"Oh yes, i do most times. Who does not"
41121,I say think of all the places you always wanted to go and then choose a place you never even considered.
41122,Yes deals will allow you to travel more for sure.
41123,Do you think you can win the lottery 
41124,Then why do you want to risk your money on such thing. Why not buy yourself a nice shoe instead 
41125,I am very glad to hear that. Do you have any children?
41126,"I have no kids, but would love to have some at some point!"
41127,i feel hopeful that i am going to recover from a mental dosirder
41128,That sounds terrible. Why didn't he come?
41129,Ah I see. I don't really talk to my brother much.
41130,That seems pleasant. I am currently in my chair working!
41131,"I need some good rest, myself. Sleep is so important!"
41132,Awesome!  Thats exciting.  What college are you applying at?
41133,Thats awesome!  I wish you the best of luck in your future studies!
41134,What is so interesting about the series
41135,I see. Are you excited about seeing the movie
41136,congratulations on getting your job we should go celebrate !
41137,as long as the cake is funfetti i am more than there 
41138,"Wow, are they going to pay for it?"
41139,"You have some very nice parents, when I graduated my parents said pay us more rent now. "
41140,"Thats a really good idea, that sounds like it would be hard to sleep though"
41141,Im glad it turned out well or i hope so.
41142,As it should.  However those things happen to everyone it is a part of life.
41143,Hopefully something better happens when we die and our lives will go on in a better way.
41144,I'm glad you enjoyed it. Was it a wedding?
41145,That's wonderful. I am going to a wedding next week!
41146,I understand. I remember when we had to save games to 5 inch floppy disks. They made really strange shuffling sounds and a lot of times didn't even read.
41147,"Yeah, I had my Commodore 64 and Amiga in the late 80's. Still, the games were great when they worked!"
41148,How wonderful. What sort of dog?
41149,A fluffy white one? How amazing!
41150,That sounds amazing! What do you think you're gonna do there?
41151,"I've been one time but I was too young to drink or gamble so it was a little boring. That sounds like a great time though, I'm happy for you!"
41152,That's unfortunate. Some people just cannot help but act rude.
41153,That's unfortunate. What do you think about Uber?
41154,That is a tough thing to deal with but hopefully his first F will also be his last.
41155,Fornite has surely caused many kids grades to drop.
41156,That was so bad. What kill the diver 
41157,It means he miscalculated the time he was to spend under the water. Sorry for him
41158,Why did u leave your luggage for a stranger
41159,"Wao,its a mistake,"
41160,That's intense. I hope you do as well as possible!
41161,Keep up the great work. Pass that exam with flying colors.
41162,"Yeah, sometimes I want to just stop going to work. I hate TPS reports so much!"
41163,"Yeah, Bill Lumbergh is the worst boss ever. He kept calling me every day when I just wanted to sleep instead of work!"
41164,"i love cats, just hold it between your arms, it will be okay"
41165,"thats better, but sorry for the disappointment she had caused"
41166,wow that is amazing I went there back in 2000. You are in for a big treat. Make sure to get french bread.
41167,Also the mcdonald's taste way better there than in the US if your looking for good cheap food. 
41168,You need to be patient. Getting promoted at your work place takes patience and perseverance 
41169,Your hopes are high. It means you have a good chance of getting it. And i hope you have the requirement too? 
41170,Wow! It looks great that you feel achieved
41171,Congrats Doctor!! your parents would have been proud of you
41172,Sorry to hear that you did not get approved.
41173,You are right about that. Owning a car can get expensive.
41174,My dream car is a Chevy Camaro.
41175,Classic 1975 would be great.
41176,Do you still have them?
41177,Do you own any other pets now?
41178,Wow.  Did you get hurt?  Sounds scary.
41179,I am always scared about those airbags!  I am so glad you are ok!
41180,"Oh my goodness, that's horrible. Who was she?"
41181,"That's horrible, I hope you are okay and are recovering from that."
41182,"No,i don't feel surprise d"
41183,"Yes,i am"
41184,I'm glad too. What made it swell up anyway?
41185,"Oh I get that, I had that happen near one of my wisdom teeth too."
41186,"Wow, it was because you were young, that is why"
41187,"It is really nothing, children behave like that sometimes"
41188,What did you pass?
41189,That's great! I bet you feel relieved.
41190,i am so happy for you. I know how it feel when you are stranded 
41191,You can collect her contact and make friend with her
41192,I didn't understand you
41193,That is bad. How could you forget?
41194,I only have a couple really good friends who are always there for me. The rest of my friends don't really care about me that much.
41195,"Yeah, we have to watch out for ourselves. At least we won't let us down, lol."
41196,That's great news to hear. I hope things continue to stay great for you.
41197,I agree. I think that difficult times are best navigated with a calm mind.
41198,I hope it doesn't rain. Where are you going?
41199,That's great. I have been there before. It used to be a Spring Break hotspot.
41200,Oh no! That's not very nice but I guess you can play it off by just acting cool and laughing it off. 
41201,"It's okay it's pretty funny, and it'll be forgotten about so quick anyhow. I know how it feels haha, we all do."
41202,"Oh ,really,that's so brave of him"
41203,"Ok,where did he travel to?"
41204,"Yikes!  Schools get really mad about that, as well as it makes the kid worry."
41205,Don't beat yourself up.  It happens all the time.  I am sure you are a loving parent!
41206,That is awful. Was anyone else hurt?
41207,"Were there any signs that the driver might have been impared, as opposed to the breaks malfunctioning?"
41208,I hope the child recovers from her injuries.
41209,"Oh wow, how did you feel about that? "
41210,How fast were they going? 
41211,"Oh how nice, how long are you staying?"
41212,That sounds exciting I hope you have a lot of fun!
41213,"That's refreshing to hear, I'm happy for you. I rarely hear that people are satisfied with their partner."
41214,"Wow, what really happened?"
41215,"Oh really, that was hectic for you I guess"
41216,You need to calm down and focus so that you can pass the exam
41217,Do you get enough sleep. Being sleep deprived can make you lose focus 
41218,what are you expecting? are you pregnant?
41219,oh nice well happy birthday
41220,Were you up when he got home?
41221,I can understand your position. How old is he?
41222,Is she a model?
41223,"Oh, so what does a ""sitting"" entail?"
41224,Who are you talking about? What happened?
41225,That is bad. I hope you see her in another event.
41226,"Yea I know that feel, outside of a few people I knew nearly know one and avoided lots of people cause no one cared"
41227,"It can be really frustrating, seems like so many people have it good while so many have the short end of the stick"
41228,"Yeah,but very few."
41229,"Most of my friend have had in the past just wanted to benefit from our relationship,it was not genuine."
41230,That's great. I'm trying to get a girlfriend right now :/
41231,Yeah they are. It makes me sad too man.
41232,Did you get a car as a gift? That's exciting.
41233,That is so nice of her! That's really really generous. 
41234,I think there must be a reason for that
41235,"Oh,thats life,so sorry for that"
41236,Do you have  a large network of friends and family?
41237,"Somewhat, ive felt better these past couple months than i usually have"
41238,"Yes definitely, makes me feel like im doing soemthing good and helps me get better looking and healthier"
41239,What was bad about it?
41240,Did you get a new phone?
41241,"Yes, it is important. What happened?"
41242,That is bad and difficult to live. Sorry to hear that.
41243,"I am so sorry to hear that, that is a real bummer. Were you injured?"
41244,That is absolutely awful! How long did it take for your ankle to heal?
41245,"wow, what did you do to deserve the car?"
41246,"thats intresting, you must be very happy now"
41247,You should find something interesting to do.
41248,"Go hand out with friends or host a night over sleep,that would be fun."
41249,Who are you waiting for a response from?
41250,I don't understand the context of this conversation.
41251,Wow that's awesome! What kind of car did you get?
41252,"Great to hear, they're really reliable good cars."
41253,"Oh really? thats sad, why is that?"
41254,"oof that sounds quite embarrassing, hopefully it doesnt keep you down too long"
41255,A lot of the time. I'm quite an easily frightened person! Especially by large animals!
41256,Have you always had a fear of falling?
41257,Congratulations. How much did you win?
41258,That's a lot of money. Can I have some of that?
41259,"Oh that sounds cool, where to?"
41260,"Sounds like a lot of fun, I kinda wish I got to do those too back in high school."
41261,You don't miss her?
41262,I would suggest you go to china and visit her.
41263,"I was supporting England too,  "
41264,Who do you think will win the cup
41265,Yea but id still manage to leave something behind anyway haha.
41266,"Just anywhere like when leaving a friends place or taking stuff on a trip, i somehow manage to forget one small thing occasionally"
41267,What steps have you taken to remedy the situation and make her feel safe?
41268,I think that's for the best. Abuse is never okay.
41269,Im sorry im not sure i follow.
41270,"Oh I see, i can imagine that can get really frustrating"
41271,"Oh no,trust me if it were me,she would hear me good!"
41272,"Wow, but to have children in the house is good"
41273,"Oh yes...children are blessings, I love them being around me"
41274,"Oh wow thats a big accomplishment, congrats."
41275,"I feel the same, college is stressful but its a nice environment."
41276,Why dont u throw the trash awy?
41277,"Yea,as soon as possible"
41278,I'm so sorry. You feel so helpless when someone you love is ill.
41279,"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that! I hope for her speedy recovery!"
41280,"I cry everytime I watch dogs on TV, always makes me sad."
41281,"Yes, I a, referring to the animal, dog."
41282,which team are you supporting
41283,yeeees. I am alos supporting France. I hope it wins
41284,"Don't you worry,there is always a next time."
41285,"Try visit Barbados,such an amazing place."
41286,I'm sorry to hear that. That's an awful way to go.
41287,Hopefully you're able to move on and be happy.
41288,That is so annoying. What came up that he had to cancel?
41289,Did you manage to reschedule? 
41290,That's really cool. What kind of dance do you do?
41291,That's awesome I've always wanted to learn.
41292,Yeah mostly when I'm not expecting something new
41293,Hahaha maybe you slept alot during the day
41294,yes.my partner is very romantic person.
41295,yes. I Of course you need a girlfriend and the girlfriend  is very lucky.stay blessed.
41296,You are so welcomed!
41297,"Ok,sounds great!"
41298,You are funny.
41299,"Wow, you are lucky."
41300,That is good. Am really happy for her.
41301,ok hope the sucessful in prayer.
41302,"ok, next"
41303,"Oh, wow. Was he stationed there? "
41304,"What was it like in Japan, did you ask? "
41305,Did you find your shoe in the end?
41306,Oh dear! That's quite a mess! Did you have to pay any fees to rebook the flight?
41307,"No. I feel fine, if a little tired. Do you?"
41308,Are you based in the US? Is it not about 2 am over there?
41309,"Yea my mother has been a huge support to me over the years, how about you?"
41310,Yea my dad was really cool but he was also a drunk sadly so he was flip floppy
41311,What do you mean exactly?
41312,"Oh cool, well that sounds like a good time."
41313,I hope you don't have work in the morning. Whenever I can't sleep easily I just give up trying and do something else.
41314,Do you know them we'll enough to ask them to stop?
41315,Oh about what exactly? Are you talking about family or friend or SO?
41316,"Ah ok, was it fun then?"
41317,"Oh yeah, I've been through quite a few sad things before. What about you?"
41318,"Definitely, the sad is needed to balance out the good."
41319,I figure we'll all be there at some point once we get old.
41320,"My parents worked in them, so I am used to them."
41321,"oooh, sorry about that, what happened"
41322,"sorry, i hope you areokay now"
41323,Where you the only one in the house?
41324,"Wow, that's nice!"
41325,"Wow, that's a big mess-up! How did that turn out?"
41326,Good thing you found someone who had as big of feet as you do!
41327,Why? What was the unexpected thing that happened?
41328,Who bought you this golden watch? Was it a wizard?
41329,Oh? Is it more of art than purpose in its form? 
41330,"Oh, I see. A workable shelf then. "
41331,Hahaha hope you did very well
41332,That's good....  I did well too
41333,"So, did you get it?"
41334,That is cool. Definitely you will
41335,"Wow, and you didn't get pulled over?"
41336,Must've been some important meeting!
41337,I don't know what flogging is.
41338,"Looking up the definition tells me its punishment by being whipped or beaten, so unless you mean you were beaten metaphorically, you shouldn't be ""wowing"" me."
41339,"Well done, what type of performance was it?"
41340,Was it a ballet. I enjoy watching dance performances.
41341,What did she surprise you with?
41342,amazing! Thats really nice
41343,What do u want to eat?
41344,"Ok,have u prepared it?"
41345,"normal is the best way, it helps the mother bond with the child"
41346,we are adamant to have our baby born normal. I have seen first hand the CS mothers and their closeness (lack of) with their kids
41347,You think so? 
41348,"Well, I've kept quite a few relationships throughout my life. If I actually wanted to look at online profiles, I do it mostly for research or investigative purposes. Other than that, I'm only interested in online chat. "
41349,"Why, what do you have planned?"
41350,Sounds like fun!  I hope you find the money to do it.
41351,Great! you must be well prepared. Are you nervous?
41352,Yes it sounds like you did everything right.  I hope you hear back from them soon about a job offer.
41353,did you get what you needed?
41354,well that's better than nothing at all :)
41355,"Oh no, I've had a few days like that. Did you laugh it off?"
41356,Well good on you for toughing it out. Your the stronger for it.
41357,what kin of food was it?
41358,I love pasta
41359,Wow that must feel good
41360,that is great
41361,how nice
41362,wow that is very nice
41363,"that sucks. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you're surrounded by people, you can still feel alone"
41364,the hardest lesson in life is that we're all alone
41365,Awesome. What type of music was played there?
41366,oh my God. that's so cool. Hope the ticket was not expensive?
41367,Who came back with a gold medal? 
41368,"Oh, nice. Well, if you work upon on something, anything is possible if you work upon it. "
41369,Hello friend! May I ask what it that you feel that way about?
41370,I don't understand what you are talking about. Are you feeling okay today?
41371,"of course, like they say happiness is contagious, if you are happy everything around you stays happy and it will be hard to die young"
41372,Also your home stays blessed because you become a more better partner
41373,Wow that must be lot of preparation 
41374,Where is this event going to be
41375,That's amazing. It's good to give your head a rest so that you will recall all the items easily when you are at the exam center
41376,I wish you all the best in the Exam
41377,"Thats good, I am not sure if I can ask what happened? "
41378,"Oh wow, I am glad that you are okay."
41379,Omg I would have ran faster than forest gump... what did you do? 
41380,Im glad no one was hurt! 
41381,"Oh no, I'm sure that was a hard memory to have brought up for you. "
41382,What was her name? Have you read Rainbow Bridge?
41383,What a beautiful name! Hopefully your memories are more happy than sad now.
41384,That's great. Teachers are so important.
41385,I wanted to become a teacher before. I was afraid of how hard it would be.
41386,Well congratulations! I hope your students appreciate you as much as they should.
41387,"Oh my goodness, did you go to check what the noise was?"
41388,I'm glad it wasn't anything serious! It's scary how quick our mind goes to the worst possible scenarios.
41389,"That's really cool of them. You weren't expecting it at all, hu?"
41390,Parents can be great sometimes. Did you have a good time?
41391,What did you find?
41392,I love old school video games. What were your favorites?
41393,Congratulations. Interviews can be stressful
41394,Thats smart. And it worked.
41395,Nice. What is his name?
41396,Nice. I like dogs.
41397,Oh my that sounds so scary! Was everyone ok?
41398,Do you think you will ever zip line again?
41399,oh no. What do you do for that?
41400,Oh. How old is he?
41401,"Well, I hope you are feeling better. What makes you so nervous? Are you worried your superiors will look down on you leaving early?"
41402,I'm sure you can get in tomorrow and see how it looks. You can work together to make sure it works!
41403,That is very cool! How much did it cost?
41404,"Wow, sounds nice! Was it hard to do the work?"
41405,"Dang, that really stinks. Why did they quit so quickly?"
41406,Perhaps you should screen new employees better? Like give them a physical performance test?
41407,I hope it's nice for you. Do you have any alternate plans?
41408,"Well, that's always a problem for me too, but at least you've got another $1.25 now."
41409,"I think that is wonderful, it's about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option."
41410,"No, but as Mark Twain once said, the law is an ass. "
41411,I'm glad they made the right decision eventually though. It's about time!
41412,The coolest race I saw was late at night on the highway out of town.
41413,"Yeah, it can be pretty dangerous, but I was young."
41414,I'm sorry to hear that. How long did you have him? 
41415,I bet pets are amazing. They're hard to replace once they're a part of the family
41416,"Oooh, that's rough. Did you make him mad?"
41417,"Well, I hope you can work things out at least"
41418,Flying has seemingly become terrible these days. What about your trip was so bad?
41419,That sounds frustrating and a little scary.  Did you eventually make it to your destination?
41420,That's too bad.  But better safe than sorry.
41421,Not too much.  I used to fly a lot but not anymore.  I stick around home now mostly.
41422,"Well, have you tried reliving that through the Pokemon app that you can interact with?"
41423,"Yes, I can understand that.. Sometimes nothing compares.. Have you guys played recently?"
41424,I know how that feels. I bet it was boring and lonely.
41425,Did you get out and do anything?
41426,That really is a big change for you! Are you excited to have some more down time?
41427,"Yeah, that feeling will change when you see him coming home with a huge smile on his face!"
41428,Was it a long flight? Or was there lots of turbulance? 
41429,"Ah, I can't imagine being up in the air that long! Sounds like it was a boring flight too. "
41430,I guess that is one positive! 
41431,"No, you should keep studying."
41432,"That stinks, it's never worth giving up though! What line of work do you prefer?"
41433,I can definitely believe that.. I hope something opens up for you soon!
41434,What was so fun?
41435,"Oh yeah!!! I love taking my dog too, she gets to get all that dang energy out before I bring her back to our little apartment!"
41436,"That sucks, I love dogs."
41437,Yes I am sure she it.
41438,Wow.. That is horrific!  I'm so glad you're okay.. Was anyone else hurt?
41439,Awesome. I am so glad to hear that.. Always good to hear the stories were someone gets away!!
41440,I agree with that! I just had the rain cancel my trip to the beach yesterday! Makes me so mad...
41441,I mean I like the rain at certain times.. But not when I'm trying to do fun stuff outside!
41442,"That is such a brilliant idea, are you excited about it?"
41443,"That's awesome, you'll thank yourself later down the road for making yourself do it!"
41444,Oh wow! I have heard of that happening to lots of people. Did they get arrested?
41445,Yes they do. It has gotten really bad around here with car thefts. It's no wonder are car insurance rates are so high.
41446,Oh really? What'd ya get?
41447,Math is a tough subject. Good for you.
41448,Being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you. Keep at it.
41449,How exciting that you were able to do that. I hope it was fun.
41450,It's funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation.
41451,How'd it go
41452,That's great. Do you present often?
41453,Glad you are safe!
41454,Have you talked to her about it?
41455,That doesn't sound too good. Has she been like this before?
41456,Was it fun? Interesting? Engaging?
41457,Good! Team based projects can be very hit or miss depending on your team so I'm glad it worked out for you
41458,Did she give you a reason?
41459,"Sorry to hear that, i hope you find somebody else in your life."
41460,Sorry to hear that.Did you lose money?
41461,"So, you never actually lost the wallet."
41462,That sounds amazing! How did it go?
41463,"That's amazing, I have only had one brithday party like that in my life."
41464,I use to have a G.I Joe.
41465,What were they sick from?
41466,I'll bet you were surprised. Were you glad to see them?
41467,Did you reconnect and promise to keep in touch?
41468,Was she your girlfriend?
41469,"That is great, did you have fun?"
41470,"Yeah, thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasn't my fault."
41471,"Yeah, that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they won't do it again?"
41472,That sucks. What was his name?
41473,Barney was the name of my hamster.
41474,I know that feeling. It's nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the DMV in real time.
41475,"It's also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time, that would definitely get me nervous."
41476,"My wife, LOVES taylor swift. "
41477,"That is awesome, I went to high school with Brett Favre! Small world."
41478,"I am glad you love her, it must be a nice feeling"
41479,That is a good thing then
41480,That wasn't smart.
41481,Why did you then?
41482,Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?
41483,"Yeah, I think once you get in the field, you're set. The jobs seem to pay well. Good luck with that, you sound like you know what you're doing."
41484,"Oh, the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday."
41485,"Well, keep working at it. It's a process. "
41486,Where has he been?
41487,Oh I bet you are excited then! He will be happy too!
41488,Is there a reason why you didn't tell your boss?
41489,Is there a way you could report it anonymously?
41490,Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day.
41491,It's been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.
41492,Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.
41493,"My brother used to have a yo-yo! He did a trick called ""Around the world"" and also one called ""The cradle."" Know those?"
41494,Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasn't good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.
41495,Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave!
41496,Did he go on anymore after that?
41497,"Well he's young, so you can't really fault him."
41498,That's good. You seem like a great parent.
41499,does it happen often in your part of the country?
41500,wow.  i can only imagine
41501,Thats nuts.
41502,Did she scream?
41503,Did you get to? What happened?
41504,"I have never been there! Sounds fun, but I don't support Sea World and the way they treat their animals."
41505,OH GOSH! I would burn the whole house down. i'm terrified of spiders and bugs
41506,i would have a heart attack!
41507,I know how you feel. Life is too short.
41508,"Yes, you do! Just keep living everyday like your last."
41509,"wow, I never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place. I sure hope he wasn't hurt."
41510,it does sound like an amzing feat
41511,ohh that's rough...did you talk to them about it
41512,do they give you any kind of value...or do they just ignore you / put you down 90% of the time?
41513,Is your relative okay now?
41514,It must've have been. Glad they are okay now.
41515,Congratulations to him! You must be proud.
41516,He's very lucky to have you.
41517,oh yeah what happened? 
41518,omg is he upset? 
41519,So did you help him / her
41520,That's pretty nice of you
41521,"Wow, thats a nice car"
41522,It happens sometimes I guess
41523,Memories.. what state? 
41524,I understand but memories are always nice. 
41525,What happened with your car then?
41526,Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?
41527,I would love that show
41528,"Oh well, it happens"
41529,Have you been to the doctor?
41530,You will be fine then
41531,Well that is quite the accomplishment. 
41532,He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.
41533,"Oh man, that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?"
41534,"Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out, but that may be me speaking too prematurely"
41535,I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.
41536,That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.
41537,Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?
41538,Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?
41539,"I know it is hard to start letting go, but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry, you are not alone."
41540,"Yeah, they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while."
41541,That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.
41542,"Ohh, that makes sense. Yeah, then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all."
41543,"I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad, I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?"
41544,"I'm so glad to hear it was good news, though!"
41545,"Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute, so cherish those you love!"
41546,It doesn't help us no. But you must take care of yourself too- Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!
41547,Coming back to work could be good after a break.
41548,That isn't good.
41549,"I wish I could feel that feeling, (unfortunately, I am a man). What did you end up naming your son?"
41550,I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.
41551,I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?
41552,Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.
41553,That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?
41554,"Well, as long as you're doing something you enjoy, that's all that really matters."
41555,Have you figured out what's the problem?
41556,Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent? 
41557,"Yes? thats so cute, but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them"
41558,"OMG, well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them, and also when you are not with them!"
41559,Are you keeping it as a souvenir?
41560,"Nice, I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot."
41561,I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?
41562,"Oh wow! I bet the person inside would've pooped his pants, but there was probably none left!"
41563,What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?
41564,"Ho, I am sorry to hear that."
41565,"Too late I already took it. Just kidding, did you find it?"
41566,"Oh, that's bad. Was there anything important in it?"
41567,"Wao thats so cool you must so excited, how long has it been?"
41568,"Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son, sorry"
41569,Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?
41570,Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared. 
41571,That's cool. I am not a swinger either.
41572,That makes no sense.
41573,That seems like a good price.
41574,right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold
41575,haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy 85 degress just regular ac pumping in my home
41576,aw man that must suck how do you huys keep cool through the summer
41577,"I'm sorry, How long has it been?"
41578,That's always a tragedy.
41579,That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?
41580,"It probably went well, despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people."
41581,Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?
41582,"Oh no, What happened?"
41583,Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?
41584,Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?
41585,"Did you get anything extra, like a bonus or a trip."
41586,Great. What business is it?
41587,I can tell where this is going.
41588,That has never happened to me. Thank god!
41589,Well does that make you anxious?
41590,"Oh, that would be rough. I've been through that too."
41591,"But if is a great opportunity for him, you should be happy."
41592,That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?
41593,"Bah, those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend."
41594,Why do you think they do that?
41595,That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.
41596,"Oh man, I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes."
41597,"Jeeeze, yea, it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?"
41598,"It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long, happy, and fulfilling lives!"
41599,That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?
41600,Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?
41601,Wow! I've never been anywhere near there.
41602,I've been to the ocean a few times but I've never even seen a surfer. We had a small boogie board.
41603,I live in Tennessee
41604,"Wow. I must have a boring life then, because I have only seen tug boats and barges on the Mississippi."
41605,Oh no! How come?
41606,Oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally. You never know how someone's home life is like.
41607,Aw well it's likely bipolar- I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds. 
41608,I would save some and maybe get something you need/want?
41609,For sure! Any extra money is always good!
41610,Had she done that to you before?
41611,What a shame! 
41612,Oh man! I wish work stress would make me lose weight lol. I gain! Are you looking for a new job?
41613,Oh I don't deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!
41614,"Wow, what brand"
41615,That is a nice car
41616,Yeah all the time. I get so jealous
41617,"Wow, that is hard to do. Congratulations my dude!"
41618,That sounds awesome!  Is Elbert a fourteener?
41619,"Hahaha.  Well, I hope you don't get sick.  Take something salty with you, maybe that will help.  Have fun!"
41620,Congratulations. I bet you're happy!
41621,Do you work for a company or on your own?
41622,Cool beans
41623,That's great! I bet that was a relief.
41624,"Wow, that should have been amazing"
41625,"Me too, I love chocolate"
41626,I've always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry I'm going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt?
41627,"Oh, that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx?"
41628,Are you sick?
41629,"That sucks, I will pray for you."
41630,"Oh my, that must've been an embarrassing situation!"
41631,"That's ok, you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people."
41632,"Yes, what about it?"
41633,Tell me all about it.
41634,I try to always go for extra sleep.
41635,Wow! 30th is a big milestone birthday! I can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you.
41636,Did you feel old after?
41637,That had to be relief. So now you won't have to deal with that frustration again.
41638,Those keyboard shortcuts can be lifesavers.
41639,Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.
41640,Its goof to have support when it does change.
41641,We would all be better people then
41642,oh wow. Bet it felt amazing. was it a mistake?
41643,sounds like a great day. makes you wish it would happen everyday
41644,That's so embarrassing! What did you do?
41645,Did anyone say anything?
41646,Well at least you got away with it this time!
41647,Do you normally feel like that when you fly?
41648,"I can understand that, flying is scary."
41649,"Hey, do you have anything on your mind?"
41650,"I agree, incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems."
41651,oh I am so sorry for your loss.
41652,"I bet. You gave him a good long life, that was the best you could do."
41653,I am sorry it was so stressful
41654,Just hope for the best
41655,ugh thats the worst right.. everyone should have holidays off. 
41656,I say skip work next time :p go for it 
41657,"i just love that, my son knows ASL"
41658,i wish schools would teach kids asl 
41659,she wants to spend time with you
41660,that was nice of her
41661,its a beautiful place
41662,in that case i agree then
41663,Where are you going on vacation?
41664,"That is close for me, but it is a fun time!"
41665,i admire that 
41666,no its not
41667,"I see, have you tried yoga and meditation? "
41668,Keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved! 
41669,"Oh my, you must have very surprised! "
41670,It must have been an enjoyable day. You have nice friends!
41671,i bet she was so excited!! Did she love her presents?
41672,that was me last christmas lol my son was only 9 months old but i bought so many presents and i was so excited to see his reaction
41673,Oh no. Why are you worried to lose it?
41674,Oh no.. That is a bit scary. I wish the best for you!
41675,"I am, thank you for asking!"
41676,"Oh no, why not?!"
41677,They really can't. It's still no excuse though.
41678,Oh that sucks...did she explain herself yet
41679,Sounds like you need a new friend or your own car...or both lol
41680,That's terrible.  Someone should call animal control on them.
41681,I hope they do something to help that poor puppy.
41682,what happened ? 
41683,did he end up biting you?? 
41684,"Oh no, that's terrible!  Are both you and your dog alright now?"
41685,"Yes, that would have frightened me too.  I'm glad he's alright now."
41686,I hope and wish so. In this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities
41687,Being optimistic will help you alleviate much of your accumulated stress
41688,"that is literally the worst, the people should have atleast told you to go ahead  first! "
41689,its really so rude. ugh im sorry 
41690,I love dogs too what breed do you have ?
41691,i have a german shepard
41692,That's awesome.  What did it take for you to get there
41693,Sounds like you've gotten smarter and more observant over the years
41694,Oh how gross! I don't like possums anyways 
41695,Just lizards and gators. I live in South Florida haha
41696,"I have heard about that game.  I heard there was one guy that makes about $500,000 a month playing it on the streaming service Twitch.  Maybe your son should give it a try."
41697,Twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games.  I guess a lot of people really love watching good players.  Go ahead and retire now and get him started!
41698,I'm sorry your friend moved away. Sounds like me when I moved from Indiana to Florida. My friend was upset when I left too.
41699,"That is your friend, you should be happy for them! "
41700,Aw I am happy for you! What do you go to school for?
41701,That is great! Good luck to you!
41702,I bet! I can't imagine what that must be like to see a bran new life.
41703,That's awesome :) I'm happy for you! Hopefully one day I will get to see that
41704,"Hopefully the things coming out of his mouth are good things, right?"
41705,Oh.  I recommend correcting that before it gets out of hand.  Good luck!
41706,What movie were you watching?
41707,That is a great movie.
41708,I do.  It feels great to get out into nature doesn't it?
41709,The beach is my most favorite place to go.
41710,"That sounds rough, were you able to get accustomed to Texas?"
41711,"I know what you mean, that happened to me when I left for college a few years ago."
41712,Wow that is really confident on your end. Are you going to do anything with the girl
41713,That sounds exciting. Just make sure she is okay with it all before!
41714,What was she referring to then?
41715,I see.  Do you get a lot of storms in your location?
41716,I always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation
41717,That movie is a classic! I loved it as a kid!
41718,Hahah! That is awesome!
41719,get them reported
41720,"You are welcome, if you take your stand they will  behave"
41721,I bet you're both excited and nervous about it! I have two kids of my own and one will be starting in about a year while the other is going to fourth grade.
41722,I'm sure it will! I hope it all works out for you.
41723,That's always a good thing. It means you should get on great with your neighbors.
41724,"Most of my neighbors are good, kind people too, so I know just what you mean."
41725,Why did you feel anxious?
41726,Hmm.. I'm a little confused.  Why were you anxious?
41727,Well that's sweet. How did the policeman react?
41728,Oh wow! That's awesome! Your son sounds like he has a bright future!
41729,I've done that before. Getting over that initial fear is really hard. But it's fun once you do!
41730,I understand completely. It's that initial anxiety. It's a scary thing to do!
41731,I bet you are pretty anxious and excited at the same time.
41732,its always nice when grandmas come visit.
41733,"Oh wow, that sounds like it might be cool but I don't know what that looks like, what is the 900?"
41734,"Yea, how old is your brother?"
41735,"I love camping, and understand why a hammock is your favorite. They're so comfortable!"
41736,"That sounds amazing, as long as you're not reading scary books about the woods!"
41737,I agree. Camping and hammocks are for relaxing and letting the mind be free. 
41738,I've actually never gone there. What's it like?
41739,That's good to hear. I do plan on taking my kids in the future!
41740,Do you live in Flordia? I have family down there and was really worried about them. 
41741,"That was lucky. Losing power is bad, but at least that was it. Scary situation. "
41742,What will happen if the secret is told?
41743,"Of course, I only tell them the best ones though!"
41744,"Oh no, was she upset at you or about something else?"
41745,Well that's really kind of you to help her like that. She's lucky to have you!
41746,"Ugh, people can be so rude. Was he able to go to the bathroom?"
41747,That's awful!! So what did you end up doing? Did he just have to pop a squat?
41748,"As long as you work hard and stay dedicated, I'm sure it will come!"
41749,"Absolutely! And if you trust your boss, I'm sure he will do the right thing."
41750,Thats scary.  Did you have to pull over?
41751,I take it you made it out safe beacuse we're here chatting
41752,That sounds like an awesome Christmas present!  I've actually thought about doing that with my girls now that they are older and not much they really need.  Where are you going?
41753,I've ALWAYS wanted to go on a Disney cruise - it's probably my dream vacation. I'm so jealous!!!
41754,That's such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time. What was your major?
41755,I totally get that. I majored in business but sometimes I wish I majored in engineering. I'm kind of glad I didn't though. It's hard!
41756,"Aww, that is very nice of them. i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago."
41757,Border Collie. Yours?
41758,I can imagine! Did you end up having a good flight?
41759,That's good! Hopefully you had a nice seatmate too!
41760,"Aww, was he scared?"
41761,I can see that. School is a challenging time for a kid.
41762,Always good to feel ready for something like that. What subject was it in?
41763,"Man, I remember those days. My engineering exams were killer. Did you do well on it?"
41764,Another man's trash is another man's treasure! What things do you save?
41765,I keep a scrapbook myself! I love collecting stamps. Got any trips planned this year?
41766,I'm so sorry that happened to you. How did you handle this situation?
41767,"I hope no one saw that, it must've been terrible."
41768,How are you going to learn! Why are you afraid to go?
41769,It ain't so bad. I'm sure you'll make a few new friends and everything will be just fine.
41770,Please describe what scared you about the caves.
41771,That seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!
41772,Is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable?
41773,"I do too but it's natural to get envious of others sometimes, don't put yourself down over it."
41774,That must be so annoying. I get that sometimes too.
41775,"I'm sad to hear that, I'm sure there is someone who cars."
41776,That's good to hear that you care for your son so much. I am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best.
41777,"Yeah, my village helped with my son's preschool tuition as well. Strength in numbers and good neighbors!"
41778,Oh yuck! Where did that happen?
41779,During dinner? ACK!
41780,Can you tell me about your recent experience?
41781,"Yeah, I love Star Wars. I was sad when Han Solo died. He was my favorite character!"
41782,"That would make me sad, did you let him go? "
41783,"I know how you feel, I'm sorry about that, at least he probably came back pretty quickly."
41784,"I'm sure they will understand. You can always have another dinner, that's the beauty of life!"
41785,Where did you end up going?
41786,"Oh no, have you look at other options?"
41787,I really hope you get it!
41788,Oh no. Did you flip him off?
41789,"That was probably for the best anyway. People who drive like that are the worst, though."
41790,"Wow, that's super annoying! I understand wanting to get things done early, but that's not very respectful to neighbors."
41791,Have you talked to him about it?
41792,are you getting laid off?
41793,"im sorry, i hope you're able to find an even better job immediately"
41794,Do you live in Florida?
41795,"Wow, that sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though."
41796,"Thats amazing, you must be a good person"
41797,Sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me. Alone can be good.
41798,Well at least you didn't have a lot of people under foot to slow you down. So I hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it.
41799,That is the worst. At least you and your husband got something worked out for your son's first day at school! 
41800, A walk down memory lane.
41801,Oh I bet! It's always good to cherish those memories.
41802,"oh that can be annoying, did you tell him anything?"
41803,hahah that's kinda funny. Maybe he just missed you!
41804,Nice! Where did you go?
41805,"Oh, that is really cool! What a great experience, and fun to bond with your dad!"
41806,Was it long?
41807,"That's long, I understand the reason behind you being upset "
41808,"I know how you feel, it's always good to bond with your buddies when you can"
41809,Thank God you will be able to tell them in person about how much you miss them
41810,"Oh yea, I can relate to the good times, is she still alive?"
41811,oh no. May her soul rest in peace
41812,Congrats! I'm sure you will have great memories. 
41813,I believe you will just continue doing what you've already done.
41814,Yes I am married
41815,I am happy and yes its a lot of work. Anything worth having takes work to keep it.
41816,HAve you been practicing? Do you have note cards?
41817,I hope you do well. IS it for school?
41818,Well congratulation on your A in advance lol
41819,Oh my gosh! Was it a wild tarantula or a pet?
41820,Thank goodness! The biggest type of spider we have here if a wolf spider. They don't really bite you unless you irritate them.
41821,Oh awesome! How are they doing?
41822,Awesome! It's nice to see people who knew you so long ago. No friendships like those!
41823,"Wow, that's really great. What charity did he donate to?"
41824,"Oh, sorry. That's awesome. What does his charity support?"
41825,Was the weather nice?
41826,I can't wait until we get nice weather. ITs too hot to do anything
41827,Some people have no concept of being rude.
41828,"no, they dont."
41829,Are you serious? That is extremely terrible news to hear. :( 
41830,"I really wish I knew what to say, but even watching my mother go thru stage 4 I still dont know what to say! Spend a lot of time with your loved ones! "
41831,"Really, isn't that unusual?"
41832,I'm glad it worked out so well for you all .
41833,I know how stressful that can be. I hope everything turned out alright.
41834,That is great news!
41835,That wasn't nice. I hope they caught them.
41836,"That sucks, how much is it?"
41837,I can relate. You just have to be yourself.  Do you know if you got the job?
41838,That’s great!  How do you like it?
41839,Is it sunny where you are ?
41840,"Glad for you, it's cloudy and humid here."
41841,Why did you wait a week? Tell her to tell him
41842,I don't know. You should have told hime when it happended. Just do it and get uit out of the way so you both can move past it.
41843,That's nice. I always like getting letters.
41844,"no, I never did. It might have been nice."
41845,58 million. That's unbelievable.
41846,"Well, you know how to get it from  him right?"
41847,ah congratulations on the engagement! How long have you two been together?
41848,No problem. I hope she'll love it as well.
41849,Oh no. Did you guys talk about it?
41850,No one's perfect. I hope you won't hold a grudge.
41851,Being prepared pays off soemtimes.
41852,how did you do on it?
41853,"Good, well I hope you get the better position!"
41854,How strict is the budget?
41855,"Ah, that makes sense, well I hope it goes well for you!"
41856,Nice. Did his team finish first?
41857,"At his age, they progress very quickly"
41858,That's very nice of them! Having caring friends is very important.
41859,What did they do for you?
41860,"I bet it does, you should find a podcast you like"
41861,"That is smart, I would recommend a nintendo switch!"
41862,I'm sorry. Any way you can get out of it?
41863,Have you always been scared of heights?
41864,Yuck!  You didn't get wet and muddy I hope!
41865,That is good to hear.  No one likes soggy shoes!
41866,Backflips are scary. Neck injury is serious.
41867,Thats good! They do look cool too.
41868,I was scared the first and only time I flew also. Where were you flying to?
41869,Oh wow! I bet that was really exciting. I have never been out of the country.
41870,You must feel horrible!  Get her something extra nice and I am sure she will forgive you!
41871,Get her flowers and a gift certificate to a nice massage place!
41872,I have the same feeling. I miss her also
41873,Are you going to have it completed in time?  I hope you are not behind schedule!
41874,Ouch!  You better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil!
41875,Wow! I would be amazed too!
41876,That's so true. Im 30 and just now having the time to work on my bachelors. But I have a lot of work experience.
41877,Same here. Well I hope he can adapt and do well. Good luck with your BA too!
41878,Wow. That's pretty hypocritical.
41879,I think she's just trying to cause a problem.
41880,Did you not have your own food?
41881,Oh no! That sounds horrible! Did the co-worker find out?
41882,Oh wow. Give me the details.
41883,Are you missing an organs?
41884,"Well, At least you're in one piece. you could have been in several."
41885,Not really? How come?
41886,"Oh wow, the BBQ must be delicious."
41887,"That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted, especially when some people say it's in its ""worst state in a long time."" We're prisoners of the moment."
41888,"Yeah, I guess you would know for sure, since you've seen it first hand. Especially a place like Haiti, that's just gets pounded with hurricanes. What brought you to Haiti, if you don't mind me asking?"
41889,I am sorry to hear that.Is there a chance you forgot your wallet home?
41890,That story could become a movie script.
41891,That’s a bummer. Drink some coffee
41892,Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda
41893,Is it not going to happen?
41894,That sucks. 
41895,You should find another job. No use being miserable. Or tell her boss!
41896,What's ELS?
41897,"Ah, gotcha. A few of my friends teach English to Chinese students online and I think they have taken ESL courses"
41898,That really sucks! What do you have to do?
41899,I do too.  I am so sorry you are going through this
41900,Wow. I had that DVD.
41901,I know. I wonder if they still do that show
41902,Some dads are cool like that. My mom is that way sometimes.
41903,I just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything
41904,Are you a busdriver?
41905,"Ah, gotcha. I hate it when things happen out of our control. Hope you get it figured out"
41906,Hi what you got going on?
41907,That is really sad.  Are you alright?
41908,I'm sorry.  Will you be able to pass this semester/
41909,I'm sure it will happen.
41910,I don't think you will need to worry then.
41911,Sorry to hear that. Why did they not attend?
41912,Hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon.
41913,"Ha, hope you aren't too scarred about being all by yourself."
41914,Watching too many horror movies I bet. Just put on some comedy special.
41915,That's quite an accomplishment. You must have worked very hard.
41916,That must have been a very hard time. Your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope.
41917,That's very good. It takes a disciplined person to save money
41918,"You truely are determined to get that car, what brand is it?"
41919,I hope you pass your exam. Did you do good at your exam?
41920,Really? What happened? 
41921,"Wow, cool! Did they let you in? It's so cool you had that opportunity."
41922,Ick. I've never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that.
41923,"Ah, I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. That's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy"
41924,"Hi, tell me what's going on with you?"
41925,"Oh, I'm well thank you."
41926,Oh really? Any reason why?
41927,Wow really? That's pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.
41928,Do tell
41929,"That's neat! I've only seen ducks and chickens. A deer did bounce over my car once, though"
41930,I guess it didn't turn out well?
41931,oh.  SWEET!  Congrats!  What are you going to do with all that money??
41932,Save it for Spider-Man that comes out next month!  I can't wait for that
41933,And more to come hopefully!  Don't forget to save for retirement and/or emergency fund :D
41934,Hello
41935,Am doing well thanks and you?
41936,"fine. But, I think you're suppose to do the prompts, so hope it doesn't cause you a rejection."
41937,What have your experiences been like?
41938,That's good to hear! Hope that it continues that way.
41939,Oh I hate that. Is it a high interest rate?
41940,It's highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible.
41941,You read
41942,"That's great , sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable"
41943,"Oh my god, that must have been so embarrasing! Was there actually a fire?"
41944,"Its okay, at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment."
41945,"Oh no, I hate having connectivity problems! Are you having bad weather?"
41946,"Oh, it has been raining here a lot too. I will keep my fingers crossed that your wi-fi keeps working!"
41947,"Yes, I am here"
41948,"Oh no, I bet that was stressful. What did you do?"
41949,I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself?
41950,"Oh that's is fun. It's a way to be alone with your thoughts, but still be around others. I love to watch people! "
41951,Yes I can related to that feeling
41952,"Well, a great morning leads to a great day "
41953,Which movie did you watch?
41954,That is a very scary movie! How are you coping?
41955,What was hurtful may I ask?
41956,"That sounds like very bad treatment, You should sue them"
41957,Maybe you haven't done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about. Do you think that's it?
41958,"Maybe. It's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way, they could be experiencing depression. "
41959,I suppose it is.
41960,You always have options!
41961,Sounds like someone who is actually not a friend. How long have you known her?
41962,I used to work with a girl like that. She always talked bad about me but was nice to my face.
41963,I can't say that I really do. It's always a mystery in my mind.
41964,I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know.
41965,"I know what you mean. Wednesdays there's this market I like to go to, but lately it just has so much rotten food"
41966,Totally. I still love to go have a look around
41967,"Yes, it is partially true. What is the problem?"
41968,That is very true. Did something bad happen to you?
41969,Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. I'm good about just letting things roll off my back.
41970,Oh no! Those can be difficult to spot sometimes.
41971,"Wow. That must have been stressful. I have babies, too. Did they understand?"
41972,That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.
41973,I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.
41974,Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.
41975,I think it's very common that we take things for granted. 
41976,"I think you can really think about all that you have, and show your thanks that you have these things. "
41977,What was depressing?
41978,"Oh, that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?"
41979,What is the name of the show?
41980,"No, I ever did."
41981,why hasnt it already been returned?
41982,"if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner, i hear you can go to small claims and get 3x the amount awarded to you "
41983,"yeah r/legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me, Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you"
41984,"That's cool. I've always been a Mac kind of girl, but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer."
41985,"I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago, but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better."
41986,what was ?
41987,oh that does sound nice
41988,Well in some ways solitude is nice.
41989,True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.
41990,Be responsible about what?
41991,"I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too, before I can go out."
41992,"Oh no, sorry to hear, hope you are OK."
41993,I agree. Hope the car will look good again.
41994,Sorry to hear that. Did you try to talk to a friend?
41995,"I agree, where did you find them?"
41996,"Oh I see, Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!"
41997,Was it an accident?
41998,Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close
41999,do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?
42000,It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?
42001,It's awful out there. It's been in the 100's here in TX
42002,"That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs, so I feel your annoyance."
42003,what job did you apply to?
42004,Somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though :P (no offence) i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol. Its a good job though! literally backbone of society
42005,Yeah that's always comforting.  Mom's are awesome
42006,Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?  
42007,Cool.  So you're the awesome mother here?
42008,:( did you stay friends with him?
42009,did you get admission? 
42010,"That's great news, well done. "
42011,:) 
42012,"Me too, especially when it's still the middle of the day."
42013,"Oh yes, you're right. I'm in the same boat right now!"
42014,"I think I am missing something, you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas???"
42015,It's definitely some kind of anomaly. 
42016,What did you eat there? 
42017,"ooooh onion soup sounds really good, onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish"
42018,I would have flipped and never talked to him again. I am so sorry my god what did you do? 
42019,"Idk beat him up, lol. throw a drink at him, the sky is the limit! "
42020,"cool, how did it come by?"
42021,"if you put so much work into it, im sure they will"
42022,I am so sorry! I would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust. How long have you been together?
42023,"Wow. I hope that you can work it out, but I would understand why you wouldn't want to."
42024,"really? well, who doesnt!"
42025,i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas
42026,"wow, what was it?"
42027,woohoo! you are one lucky child!
42028,"No way! I just moved from NY to FL. You are going to love NY tho, its an awesome state. Congrats on the job! "
42029,Oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city. I was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like Idaho where I lived in NY. :p 
42030,I would too why would she not tell you!? Did yall break up? 
42031,That sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved. :/ 
42032,What incident was that ?
42033,what happened then ?
42034,"I know what you mean, it sucks when those ""dates"" linger over us even if we try not to think about them. Im so sorry to hear that! "
42035,"Its not time to get over it, you arent doing any wrong its okay to ""feel"" things. I hope people around you give you a lot of love! "
42036,"i understand what you are saying, pets are always close to our hearts"
42037,"yeah, i have 2 german shepards"
42038,is it a scary movie?
42039,no i never heard of it
42040,yea thats probably the best choice to make
42041,"Yuck, that is terrible. I would be grossed out too. What did you do?"
42042,I'm sure you did. Guess he couldn't make it to the trash can.
42043,oh thats really sweet!
42044,oh no.. i hope you feel better
42045,Those are great aren'
42046,Sorry(Those are great aren't they?) I do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years. Those memories are to be cherished and repeated :)
42047,wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle
42048,Do you think it was the right decision?
42049,That's great. Maybe you will get a raise too
42050,oh i can understand that
42051,That must have been terrifying
42052,I don't know what I would have done
42053,Awesome! What kind of dog is Lola?
42054,I don't think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome!
42055,"That's nice, is she technologically savvy?"
42056,Well it's nice she's making the effort!
42057,I do too. I have a box filled with them. How old is your oldest?
42058,wow!
42059,That's good. Now you don't have to worry about it.
42060,"Wow, your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things!"
42061,What did you bet?
42062,That would be awesome! Did your cousin pay you?
42063,"Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay."
42064,I am so sorry. I hope she is able to get some relief and rest.
42065,Oh man! That must have been great to hear! What did he say?
42066,That's so funny! That's one of those things you will definitely remember forever!
42067,Oh I can understand that! I would also like to be outside; it looks like such a beautiful day! At least it is almost the weekend!
42068,That's great! Are you going to join your friends at the park?
42069,You should have taken a flashlight just in case. 
42070,hey at least you got a nice workout in!
42071,That is true. Well I'm glad you made it home safely. Maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out.
42072,I had ice cream too! Sorry you got sick
42073,"Ha, at least it was good"
42074,Thats always fun! Does your pup do well with other dogs?
42075,Mine does the same thing. Goldens are so adorable.
42076,He is just a mix breed. We really don't even know.
42077,"lol, it happens to us all"
42078,haha true
42079,That sucks did you need to return something?
42080,That stuff is pretty expensive. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something.
42081,Oh wow! I would have been so disgusted and outraged! What did you do?
42082,That must have been a terrible experience. I'm not sure that I would be able to wear that jacket again.
42083,i hope you do really well
42084,going to see some old friends this weekend
42085,Good job what did you work hard on?
42086,Nice keep it up!
42087,That is awesome!  What are you studying
42088,was it hard to go back or are you enjoying it?
42089,Well good luck!  I am sure you will do great!
42090,I do like the rain though
42091,I am sure you will have plans again
42092,"Yeah, I am sure it will be fine"
42093,I would have been to. I always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that.
42094,"Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous, and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine)."
42095,I take you don't have issued with you weight.
42096,"Ok, then.If it was a 1 thing only, no problem."
42097,Is he acting creepy at all? 
42098,Have you tried to talk to him at all and see what his deal is?
42099,"That's good you have well-behaved dogs, did you train them?"
42100,Well it's good you're doing something right.
42101,Oh no! What did you do to bring yourself down? (from the panic attack)
42102,I'm sorry. That sounds bad. Flying always makes me nervous but I usually make it ok.
42103,Well we are friends aren't we? I do appreciate you as one.
42104,You wanna maybe go to the bar with my other friends this weekend? They will probably like you. Tim likes some things you do.
42105,Oh i hate it when i get those kind of thoughts but eventually you recover and don't think about it.
42106,Just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender.
42107,Naptime is a good thing though isnt it
42108,Well that is never good
42109,That doesnt sound too fun
42110,"Oh wow, the kid is a snitch"
42111,"It happens, everyone does it"
42112,I am sure you will fix it
42113,Have you spoken to him about it?
42114,Are you going to do anything about it in the future?
42115,"congratulations im glad, hopefully you will like it more than your last job"
42116,im glad to hear that
42117,what kind of pizza?
42118,what!! i hope u got your money back
42119,Did your car end up overheating?
42120,Thats great! But what did they do that you didn't like?
42121,Well looks like that didn't work out for him in the end. What finally got him axed?
42122,Did you replace it?
42123,Do you think he'll get angry?
42124,did you start walking faster?
42125,hopefully you made it out safely
42126,That is good to hear. What happened that made you think so?
42127,Oh ok. That sounds like they really get along well. It is nice to have good neighbors.
42128,Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope it was nothing serious!
42129,That's good to know!  You all have a lot to be thankful for!
42130,I would hope so too or else the relationship would be awkward.
42131,I hope it wasn't too much money just in case.
42132,What you you have planned?
42133,Really?? It sounds like there was something going on.
42134,Oh that's never a good situation. It happens to the best of us though. I need to clean my fridge
42135,"I'm sure they were thinking waste not, want not. haha"
42136,Oh yeah? Find anything interesting?
42137,"Ah, nothing quite like that feeling. I remember when I was on the school newspaper. Good times."
42138,"Are you going, too?"
42139,"Oh no, that sucks. Would you have wanted to go though?"
42140,"Well, that's not cool."
42141,Does he do that stuff often?
42142,Oh? What kind of project?
42143,Oh that's nice of them! 
42144,"That's good, do you get paid over time?"
42145,I think if you keep it up you'll get the recognition you want soon.
42146,Was everything okay? What were they doing?
42147,"True, you never know these days."
42148,Is your phone waterproof?
42149,You are so lucky! My phone would have been done...
42150,That's great! Are you seeing results?
42151,I bought a spin bike but I haven't used it yet
42152,Maybe they were left for you.
42153,He can't save them out in the open. What kind were they?
42154,Did he get it back? I hate it when that happens...
42155,You are a true friend indeed. I bet he is very appreciative!
42156,Did he eventually find one?
42157,That is making progress.
42158,Congratulations!  What do you plan on doing?
42159,That is a great goal to set for yourself.
42160,I am sorry to hear that. I hope the results will be good.
42161,It is good new.
42162,Was it an intruder?
42163,What a surprise haha
42164,I did too. Did you go out last night?
42165,Well I stayed up late too. Drinking beer and playing vidos games lol
42166,Holy goodness! That's so cool. What will you do there?
42167,"Oh my god! That's something to be proud of, congrats!"
42168,I am sorry you are feeling like this.  Maybe you should reach out to someone
42169,I am sorry that you are going through this
42170,"Oh wow, now that's funny! I've only been on one roller coaster and it was rather small, but I loved it!"
42171,Oh wow! I'd love to go on a much larger coaster than the one I road. But it might be scarier than I imagine.
42172,They are still cute at this age and they make a lot of progress.
42173,"Oh no! Well hopefully she wasn't too upset, then you'll know how her character is :)"
42174,"Oh no! Well, honestly if she can't deal with one mistake, then it's no good anyhow. But maybe it was something else. Sometimes people just don't click."
42175,I feel you! I don't like to perform in front of people either. Did you decline?
42176,"Oh you can be as bad as you want there, it just matters if you're having fun :)"
42177,"Wow , i bet it was a long day of moving, but i can imagine the joy you must feel inside you, congratulations !!!!"
42178,"I used to move furniture for my old job, so i bet it was a lot of heavy lifting, its so exciting to finally have your own place"
42179,I hope you do! What is the test on?
42180,Oh man. That was a difficult subject for me after Physics. Are you a science major?
42181,I understand how lonely it can be when your schedule doesn't fit with your old friends.
42182,You can make new friends. Its just part of the human experience. Everything is temporary
42183,Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that!
42184,Dogs are with us for such a short amount of time. Kinda wish they lived as long as us.
42185,Friends can be so awesome!
42186,What did they help you with?
42187,I'm sorry to hear that. Where did they go?
42188,"Oh man, Sometimes it's hard to strike that work life balance."
42189,Are you going to wear a suit?
42190,War would be terrifying. What makes you think we will?
42191,Yea. Seems to be more of that lately.
42192,What have they been doing?
42193,Do you honk at them?
42194,Wow. He must be really strong! Why'd he lift the car?
42195,Oh I've heard of those contests. Must be exciting to see.
42196,What is the protest for?
42197,What happened? Why were they being limited?
42198,"They do love to surprise ya, don't they?"
42199,Interesting. I didn't know that. So did you end up taking it outside?
42200,Family time is so precious. Are your kids still with you?
42201,They grow up so fast sometimes.
42202,I'm so sorry to hear that!
42203,Did they say why?
42204,"Yea, I totally get ya on that."
42205,"Man, are you me? People been annoying lately?"
42206,Here I was hoping a Walmart would open in my area. Guess it's a good thing there isn't one.
42207,Oh which Disney? Sounds exciting!
42208,What's your favorite thing to do there?
42209,"Yeah, It bothers me when people don't take responsibility for their actions."
42210,Lol. Why didn't she tell you?
42211,So you're not gonna see her again?
42212,Gotta have brains
42213,Why did you stop?
42214,Wow. I drink Dr Pepper like coffee.
42215,I bet. I get that feeling every morning with a Dr Pepper
42216,Why would you have twenty dollars on the desk
42217,OH. Thats terrible.
42218,Tots?
42219,Congratulations on your hair.
42220,where is that
42221,oh id love to visit there one day when its a more stable area
42222,I know! It's almost an unexplainable feeling isn't it?
42223,But it is also the best feeling ever! Enjoy every moment!
42224,Best advice I ever got was that housework can wait and take naps whenever you cam when the baby sleeps!
42225,What did you almost buy?
42226,"Ah, yea, I've had the once or twice. When you buy used you have to go in with the mindset of haggle down, find a decent one, or leave"
42227,"I love heavy rain, it just really soothes me."
42228,I know! Also the thunder is so cool to listen to.
42229,I did a research on a cancer vaccine  
42230,Oh sorry for the mix up
42231,OK. I hope you are now fine?
42232,Never. I hate cats personally
42233,I've come to hate them too unfortunately. Constant noise
42234,"Oh, that's so sad. What earthquake?"
42235,"Oh, that's a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage"
42236,Aw that's so sad! Did you help it?
42237,"I guess that's fair, but I probably would've taken it to the vet."
42238,Me neither. It's why I hate living in London
42239,Nope. We just remain miserable year round
42240,Music can be so touching to the soul.
42241,Who was the artist of the song?
42242,I like incense. Did you find the cause of the bad odor?
42243,Oh well I hope you can fix it soon
42244,What made you realize that? You can't live in fear
42245,It's good to face your fears
42246,Oh was it a bad or naughty thought?
42247,What was it? Was it really that crazy?
42248,I think that happen in a lot of families.
42249,I understand. You were the only one getting hit?
42250,ooh my God he hurt himself
42251,so bad i can imagine that loose he made to you
42252,how was it ?
42253,wow i can only imagine
42254,thats a good thought to have
42255,i totally agree with that
42256,wait til she leaves and continue
42257,Sounds like an interesting job.  I'm sure it's taxing on the family though.
42258,In the end is the trade off worth it?
42259,I am so jealous. He is one of my all time favorite actors. 
42260,Were you star struck?
42261,Oh no.. what did you do?
42262,I would have done the same as well
42263,Oh no.. I'm sure you did not feel great when you found out
42264,I would be too. Hopefully that gets resolved soon
42265,That is exactly the way you are supposed to feel. Did you get the job?
42266,Good for you! Congrats buddy
42267,oh yea congrats.. what will you be doing
42268,that sounds like a good career
42269,thats really cool. How did he react?
42270,This is such an awesome coincidence buddy
42271,"Oh yeah, i hear that it is really scary"
42272,"Oh no.. But it gave you such a memorable experience as well, right?"
42273,Oh so sorry to hear that.. what did you do?
42274,"I hear you.. dont worry, things will be ok soon enough"
42275,I am sorry to hear that.  You weren't hurt were you?
42276,Were you at fault?
42277,aww.. that is so sweet.. i bet every parent feel that way
42278,oh no.. i feel sorry for you buddyt
42279,Oh wow. is it really as scary as the reviews say it is?
42280,"Damn, sounds like such a stunning experience"
42281,"I can image, that's pretty disgusting.  What your friend sick or drunk?"
42282,You can only do so much.  Next time I'd just let him drink on his own.
42283,Oh lord.. How did it happen?
42284,"God.. That is really disgusting, yes"
42285,That sucks.  How long have you been a teacher for?
42286,Yeah I'd imagine.  The months off for summer is nice though.
42287,"So, why didn't you just pay for them your self?"
42288,Sorry to hear that.. Why were you alone?
42289,"I hear you.. Socialize, get new friends.. You will start adapting"
42290,Oh dear lord.. Was he sick or something?
42291,"haha.. Sorry, i couldn't help but picturize it."
42292,Holy.. What did they want?
42293,I see.. Any specific reason for that?
42294,It is really good to have that level of discipline
42295,Same here.  It helps make cooking go smoother.
42296,Agreed.  No sense wasting time while cooking by looking for odds and ends.
42297,i bet you did.. Felt nostalgic huh?
42298,that is really innocent and sweet of you my friend
42299,Aww.. Did you used to go as a family to the beach?
42300,Such a sweet story.. So happy just to hear that from you
42301,WOW!! She is my absolute favorite!
42302,So true.  I was so jealous of brad pitt over the years
42303,Aw.. sorry about that my friend. Have you made any friends?
42304,So true.. family is everything!
42305,"Oh no, what did he do?"
42306,"Aww, you got to admit that is so cute as well"
42307,That is really sweet my friend. It is nice to see old friends
42308,"Aw, i am missing my high school now that you said it"
42309,Haha. Do you love sports cars that much?
42310,Such passion for cars. Wish you can buy one soon mate
42311,How much better did it pay?
42312,"That is not too much, I think you made a good choice"
42313,Sorry to hear that my friend. Why did you move?
42314,"I see.. Dont worry, you will own your new city soon enough"
42315,"I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?"
42316,Did you end up buying anything?
42317,Well is it close to where you live? That would be cool to go back often
42318,"that is a good tactic actually, it boosts your confidence"
42319,Very true. We should believe in ourselves for others to do that
42320,"Oh my god, sorry to hear that my friend.. Were you guys close?"
42321,How sad.. Find peace knowing that she is in heaven now
42322,"what did she get sick off , im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife"
42323,"When i get married i want to be like you , and take care of my loved one "
42324,That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?
42325,"Me, too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now, right?"
42326,Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.
42327,"Yep, that's the way of the world, especially with Universities to."
42328,A duplicate? Like a fake?
42329,That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.
42330,Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?
42331,"Ah yes, a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still, what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day. "
42332,"I would be so lost without my phone, but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though! "
42333,Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?
42334,"So, it was your partner who used you card"
42335,Oh no! Was anyone hurt?
42336,That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?
42337,Are you willing to go on another safari?
42338,I'm not surprised.
42339,That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.
42340,That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.
42341,You are telling me you are a hoarder?
42342,Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine
42343,Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.
42344,I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though
42345,That's crazy! I'm glad there was nothing there.
42346,Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.
42347,That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.
42348,That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.
42349,I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.
42350,Do you have full cover?
42351,Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?
42352,Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.
42353,Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?
42354,"Yeah, we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce."
42355,That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!
42356,"Cherish this time you have, because you never know when it could change!"
42357,What restaurant is it for? 
42358,Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.
42359,That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?
42360,Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.
42361,"Oh no, I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?"
42362,"Dang, that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that"
42363,"Wow, you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!"
42364,Geniuses don't do chores my friend.
42365,"I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. It's good that you're at peace with it, though. "
42366,But a part of her is still here in you. 
42367,They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...
42368,I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence
42369,Whoever ate it all is evil!!!
42370,I know right. I would be so furious!
42371,I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.
42372,"Yeah, something should be done about it!"
42373,I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!
42374,Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!
42375,Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?
42376,What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?
42377,"That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier, him or you?"
42378,He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!
42379,"Ugh, I hate when unexpected expenses arise."
42380,"Well, that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back."
42381,"Wow, great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!"
42382,"Well, keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day."
42383,Please tell me you won a lot of money.
42384,lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.
42385,OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?
42386,Hopefully they remember
42387,Did you brush it right out?
42388,Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?
42389,You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!
42390,"Yea, and you can bring some water toys to play with!"
42391,Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?
42392,"How much total weight did you lose, and how long did it take?"
42393,Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?
42394,Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  You'll probably put on like 10 pounds
42395,"Aww man, I hope you brought your raincoat."
42396,"That's good, you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold."
42397,That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!
42398,Did you get a video of it?
42399,"Gee, he must have been really hungry! That's a lot of eggs!"
42400,Wow.. that's unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is. 
42401,"Oh dang, that really sucks. I can't believe TSA would go that far, it must've been super embarrassing. "
42402,"Dude, you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it."
42403,"Oh yeah, what was it called? I really love roller coasters!"
42404,I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!
42405,"Oh, I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college."
42406,All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.
42407,That's awesome. I hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee. Are you excited to be there?
42408,Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!
42409,"Wow, that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?"
42410,"Gee, she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!"
42411,Did you feel very emasculated by this?
42412,"Yeah, I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!"
42413,I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?
42414,My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!
42415,"Oh wow, I bet the emotions of that came back to you."
42416,"Yes, those memories are what make life so special."
42417,"So, not a surprise, but still nice to get? "
42418,That's sweet. 
42419,"Wow, thats very admirable of you.  People who abuse animals are the worst kind of people."
42420,I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I can't believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.
42421,Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.
42422,That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.
42423,"Oh yeah, why is that?"
42424,I would have them towed!
42425,Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?
42426,Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.
42427,That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?
42428,Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!
42429,That's good that you found happiness. That's what were all in the pursuit of right?
42430,You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy. 
42431,that's great that you can trust her.  how old?
42432,"That's great. Be thankful, some people aren't so lucky."
42433,what did you almost buy?
42434,It's hard to find good quality at walmart
42435,I would try target.  good quality stuff there.
42436,"try googling it, and read thru the reviews"
42437,Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?
42438,"Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate, right?  Location, Location, Location."
42439,Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then
42440,You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?
42441,Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?
42442,"Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now, with a manager who cares."
42443,Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?
42444,"Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age. "
42445,We can surely hope! 
42446,That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?
42447,I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.
42448,Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?
42449,You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.
42450,What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?
42451,"Yeah, I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job, considering dealing with the public, hours during holiday seasons, etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives."
42452,"lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro , thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time"
42453,"wow , i would love to have a cat like yours "
42454,Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?
42455,haha that must have been a crazy concert! 
42456,"Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as, say, an administrative job"
42457,"Well, I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture"
42458,"OOO I love doing that, but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?"
42459,"Still, a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!"
42460,That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?
42461,Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!
42462,I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff
42463,Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids
42464,I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?
42465,Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?
42466,"Aww poor baby, hopefully shes doing fine now."
42467,That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.
42468,"Ha, I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it."
42469,True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!
42470,Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?
42471,I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!
42472,Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)
42473,"I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like ""okay, so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?"" Heartfelt apologies go a long way, and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying."
42474,Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?
42475,I would have complained.
42476,"Ohh, I feel sorry for you"
42477,"Ohh, that's bad. You can always skype your family!"
42478,"Yes, I feel you. Cleaning sucks, but after all that hard work, the results are amazing!"
42479,Me too! You seem just like me!
42480,That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?
42481,"That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness, joy and fun times!"
42482,Are there any other family members out there that could help her?
42483,"Wow, I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but I'm sure she figured something out."
42484,That's great! I am happy for you!
42485,"Yeah, and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!"
42486,"i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule "
42487,"same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will "
42488,"I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past, so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family."
42489,Aww that's great! What breed? 
42490,Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?
42491,"Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me, I can't imagine being there for that long"
42492,I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.
42493,Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!
42494,"oh man, that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else."
42495,how many cats do have?
42496,"Aw, I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?"
42497,They say dogs are mans best friend. 
42498,What kind of dog was he?
42499,"Nice, I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere. "
42500,"Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago, I know how terrible that feels."
42501,"Neither did we. He seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day,"
42502,surprise gifts are always fun.
42503,that sounds like a well deserved plan.
42504,"Oh man, I can relate, that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment"
42505,"Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away"
42506,that sounds prettty bad!
42507,I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.
42508,Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!
42509,I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. 
42510,The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.
42511,What store were you at? 
42512,Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer? 
42513,"Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? "
42514,Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.
42515,That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.
42516,"Oh, I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol"
42517,That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.
42518,Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.
42519,Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.
42520,"Oh man, that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?"
42521,"Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy."
42522,Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that
42523,That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times
42524,That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now
42525,"That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!"
42526,Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?
42527,"Bills do take up a lot, don't they."
42528,Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?
42529,How did you discover exactly what it was?
42530,Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?
42531,I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!
42532,I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.
42533,You went through a lot of losses.
42534,"That sounds painful, I hope you were okay after your fall. "
42535,"Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay. "
42536,Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!
42537,Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?
42538,I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?
42539,The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?
42540,Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?
42541,I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!
42542,How'd the hurricane go?
42543,Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.
42544,Was he okay?
42545,Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.
42546,Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.
42547,I bet he is. Don't worry
42548,That is a great idea
42549,Saving money is important
42550,That's amazing! You must be so proud.
42551,She's also a hard worker.
42552,That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.
42553,Good to know there is still kind people in the world.
42554,That's awesome! Who were they from?
42555,"That was really sweet of him, maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved."
42556,You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.
42557,That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!
42558,We all do things we regret when drinking
42559,Thats usually how it goes
42560,You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?
42561,hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.
42562,I wish you luck
42563,I am sure you will meet them
42564,That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?
42565,"I would have been disappointed, too. "
42566,Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.
42567,"Oh right, I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol."
42568,Cool. Was it interesting?
42569,Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol
42570,ARe you happy or sad?
42571,I bet. I she moving school or a job?
42572,Oh cool that's great! What were you doing that they recognised?
42573,Awesome. What is your job?
42574,Wow was it a scam or was it legit?
42575,That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?
42576,Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!
42577,That's great. Are you excited?
42578,Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.
42579,Was it real?
42580,That's awesome. What are you going to buy?
42581,Australia. I hope to go there some day
42582,"I bet, I will get there one day"
42583,I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother
42584,Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks
42585,That has happend to me too.
42586,You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though
42587,We live and we learn lol
42588,I used to love that band
42589,I have not either
42590,Probably at 4 or 5! lol
42591,No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?
42592,Was it real because I get those every day lol
42593,I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol
42594,oh no! what happened?
42595,"ah, crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse"
42596,Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.
42597,That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy
42598,"Hm, that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation, since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened, or what did that mean?"
42599,"Oh, so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm, no foul."
42600,That sounds perfect
42601,The dentist makes me a bit nervous
42602,Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!
42603,"That is awful, did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? "
42604,"You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot, maybe they can track down the car."
42605,What kind of food was there?
42606,It is nice that you enjoyed it.
42607,Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?
42608,Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well
42609,Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.
42610,"It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well, just think of all the good times and be thankful."
42611,That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests
42612,"Oh yes. But, I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle, but important diffeence"
42613,"Judging by the :(, I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?"
42614,I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D
42615,"I hope where ever you go, you visit someplace amazing!"
42616,That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?
42617,You are lucky.
42618,Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?
42619,"Hopefully you had a lock on them, you can never be too safe."
42620,Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.
42621,That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!
42622,I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?
42623,I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !
42624,wow that is very rude of her
42625,No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me
42626,I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.
42627,Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!
42628, I will be expecting to see you there.
42629,Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.
42630,Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?
42631,"Is that a reference to the color of the hair, the shape or something else?"
42632,How did it go? That's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!
42633,Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.
42634,"Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly, once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality. "
42635,"I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers."
42636,Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!
42637,I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.
42638,"Yeah, it's like a small world."
42639,I think it is merely a coincidence.
42640,Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?
42641,"Oh, I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry"
42642,I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times. 
42643,Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important. 
42644,That's awesome!  What do they do?
42645,"That would be nice, but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future."
42646,That sucks. How fast were you driving?
42647,I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit
42648,"Oh man, I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow"
42649,"Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans, we make mistakes. "
42650,That is probably so annoying
42651,That really sucks. How long will it be going on?
42652,"Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky, depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?"
42653,"Well, then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck, and enjoy this time! :)"
42654,Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.
42655,I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again? 
42656,"right, i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! "
42657,Is she doing okay now?
42658,"great, I am very glad to hear she is getting better!"
42659,"Well congrats then, I am sure that is not easy"
42660,What caused that to happen?
42661,"Oh gosh, hopefully it doesnt happen next time"
42662,What were the photos of?
42663,It is good to have those and look at once in awhile
42664,"I am sorry to hear that, what happened?"
42665,Did you try therapy at all or counseling?
42666,"I am sorry to hear that, I hope things improve for you a ton!"
42667,Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many
42668,I interpret the difficulties
42669,the lack of humor
42670,"Oh goodness, I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?"
42671,That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.
42672,What kind of stuff is in there?
42673,"Oh okay, I love going through my old stuff too, it is really fun"
42674,I hope you both have tons of fun!
42675,that's great! I'm glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.
42676,i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me
42677,Uh OH what happened
42678,"Oh no, well mistakes do happen, it will be behind you in a few days"
42679,Exactly good luck
42680,Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?
42681,I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?
42682,Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.
42683,"Oh, OK!  WHere are you moving to?"
42684,That's good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!
42685,That's exciting. Do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?
42686,What all is on the agenda for the date?
42687,Great. Are you going to get it published?
42688,What is the book about?
42689,Boo. What genre?
42690,OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?
42691,You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again
42692,Ouch. I hope she's okay.
42693,"thats good, its always a good feeling after"
42694,thats the way to do it
42695,Did his team win?
42696,That's great news! I bet you're so proud.
42697,Oh no!  Why are they driving you crazy?
42698,That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!
42699,Storms are the worst and destroy so much.
42700,My family went through a big storm a few years ago.
42701,what happened on the phone call?
42702,I am so sorry about that.
42703,Has it made any scratch marks?
42704,Have you tried disciplining him in anyway
42705,Sounds like it's time for a crate.
42706,"Yea, I hate calling ATT or Verizon they take forever to get on the phone."
42707,"I think as we get smarter, it will get better."
42708,Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!
42709,It is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!
42710,Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?
42711,That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!
42712,Did you let him borrow it?
42713,That's good to hear. I assume everything went ok?
42714,Awesome. Alls well that ends well.
42715,Did you say yes?
42716,Where does she plan to go?
42717,"Money problems are never fun. Trust me, I know."
42718,"Yeah, definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?"
42719,"Oh no, I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life, and they're truly part of the family."
42720,"Yes, they're honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life, so try to take comfort in that."
42721,That is great! Doing what?
42722,I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!
42723,I can never go on long trips.
42724,"I can no longer afford them, long trips cost the most."
42725,Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?
42726,How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.
42727,I am bad at every game.
42728,"I still could not do that, I am very weak human person."
42729,"Do what i did, quit the job and live at home with mom."
42730,I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.
42731,"That's awful! Luckily I paid all mine off, but I know many people still struggle with it"
42732,"Yea...the education costs are atrocious and, honestly, not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so"
42733,Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.
42734,What kind of job do you have?
42735,"I'm sorry, did anyone see?"
42736,I hope you would wear a belt next time.
42737,That sounds like a blast.  Compared to my job LOL.  
42738,I'm sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!
42739,LOL.  Be careful.. thats a ton of carbs.
42740,eww LOL
42741,Happy Birthday!
42742,What all did they do for you?
42743,How long did it take for you to teach you dog that?
42744,"I thought I would take longer, like months!"
42745,Oh no. Maybe you can get some things done around the house.
42746,"Lol, That sounds like a plan. Working two jobs is hard."
42747,Yummy... what did you eat?  I am hungry.
42748,That sounds so good.  Like I love that stuff.
42749,I am glad no one in your family is sick.
42750,Thank goodness my family is healthy too.
42751,"But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still,"
42752,Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes
42753,is there a special reason?
42754,going anywhere good?
42755,that sounds fun
42756,That is great. How have you done it?
42757,That is a lot of walking. I can hardly walk 1 mile.
42758,I have never been on a trip before.
42759,I have long weeks every single day.
42760,I would just quit and live off the government.
42761,Everyone can! Just gotta try.
42762,how sweet and thoughtful of you
42763,"You seem to be a very compassionate person, very kindhearted."
42764,"Ohh, I so sorry."
42765,Hope you are doing better. I'll pray for you.
42766,Good for you! stay healthy
42767,Forget that! Eat pizza and enjoy life.
42768,"I agree, I eat what I want when I want all the time."
42769,You have to have fun!
42770,Get drunk and go out!
42771,"I never go to the store anymore, I wish i did."
42772,"Not for me, i shop online mostly these days."
42773,Just go for it! Never look back!
42774,"Best of luck my friend, you can do anything."
42775,I own an animal shelter here in my home town.
42776,I try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs.
42777,That's great! I hope she goes to a good graduate school.
42778,Don't feel bad now. What's done is done
42779,I can understand. I am really sorry
42780,That is so sad. I hope they recover okay. Hopefully you weren't in trouble for being late either.
42781,"That is awesome, are they coming to visit you?"
42782,"Awesome! I'm not a father yet, but I can only imagine your kids growing up and leaving to live their own lives."
42783,"Aw, I'm sorry, did you just forget or you were thinking about other things?"
42784,"Yeah, had a similar scuffle with my wife, but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget."
42785,I have never liked spiders.
42786,You should always have bug spray on you at all times.
42787,That is really scary. Are you home alone?
42788,I'm sure you are fine. I bet it is just a tree branch or something like that. Maybe a neighbor could go look for you.
42789,"YAY, a promotion is always amazing.  when do you start?"
42790,"Thats amazing, financial stability can be a life changer."
42791,Maybe they're very eager to go a certain item.
42792,"True, because regretfully I act that way sometimes too."
42793,Yeah I hear you! Do you like to read or watch TV?
42794,"I like to do both as well. TV if I'm feeling lazy, reading if I feel more ambitious. "
42795,Oh no!! How did you dry them?
42796,Oh that sounds awful! But at least no one stole anything from your car.
42797,Did you take it back that is so disgusting. 
42798,"I wouldn't want another either it takes one time for me to find hair, bug etc and I am done with the restaurant.  "
42799,Best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself.
42800,That sounds great! I really pays off to be prepared. 
42801,That sounds like some efficient planning! I hope you enjoy your trip!
42802,"I can understand you. But this is the cycle of life, right? Kids grow and they have to find their own way of life in this world"
42803,Good for you. You can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones
42804,"Oh no, I'm sorry. Did you stay long?"
42805,"Maybe she was around, but it wasn't time for the ball yet."
42806,That's wonderful. He'll be so excited when he finds out!
42807,I hope you guys have a great time. Just the two of you.
42808,Concerts can be a lot of fun! Will you be going to another one?
42809,I've never been to a Beyonce concert. Always sold out! I'm glad you got to see her.
42810,Congratulations! Good to hear your hard work is paying off.
42811,You should definitely be proud of yourself. Pat yourself on the back.
42812,Yeah I hope you get it! I'm sure they will recognize the extra time you've been doing.
42813,"Wow, I hope you're getting paid for all that extra time!"
42814,Sorry to hear that my friend.. Was she facing an emergency?
42815,"I know it sucks, but i think you should have an open conversation to your girl about this"
42816,That is a tragedy! Where do you think you left it? Did you check your pockets?
42817,Interesting. I hope you do find it. I don't know how you brush your hair.
42818,"I am so sorry to hear you're going through this. Hopefully, it's nothing."
42819,"Oh, so you always prepare well huh?"
42820,I always wanted that level of discipline. good for you :)
42821,Congratulations! boy or girl
42822,"well, as long as its a happy healthy baby you guys will be fine"
42823,Yep. Happy and healthy is a blessing
42824,What's the band?
42825,Wow. That must suck. Do you like the band incubus? I missed them a couple of times but I saw them this year
42826,yes. I wish I could send you a clip of it from the concert. It was awesome. Maybe you could catch def leppard next time. 
42827,"Oh, such great nostalgia. "
42828,oof that sucks.
42829,yea you shouldnt be
42830,well hopefully you find a better path in life
42831,"Oh wow, i did not even know about the transfer. I bet Laker fans are delighted"
42832,So true. I might become a lakers fan myself at this point
42833,That really sucks. Have you tried taking some melatonin?
42834,"Yeah, it works wonders for me when I can't sleep."
42835,Oh god.. so sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did Tom pass?
42836,I can feel your emotions. Find peace in knowing that Tom is at a better place now
42837,Why are you so thankful? Is it Thanksgiving?
42838,That's great to hear. It's always good to have a great family support structure when times are hard.
42839,"Oh no, that is a terrible thing to do."
42840,I applaud your response.
42841,Oh no!!!  Did it smell bad?
42842,Ewwwww!  Hope the cat is okay!
42843,Sounds exciting.  I wish you the best of luck!
42844,Don't worry everyone is nervous on the first day.
42845,thats an awful thing to do! what did you do?
42846,i am so glad that you did 
42847,oh no.. what happened? did you face a financial loss?
42848,so sorry to hear that.. hopefully things work out for you real soon
42849,"Great! Don't be nervous, be confident.  Works like a charm."
42850,Don't be. Just visualize yourself already having the job.
42851,Congrats
42852,That is no good dude
42853,You should. and get new friend
42854,You did! That's so cool!
42855,Any free money is great.
42856,Oh that sounds exciting! when do you go?
42857,"A new start and a new life, that is exciting! I hope you love it."
42858,mine too.. the nature is so peaceful and beautiful during the fall
42859,"i have been there, it is so lovely. you are going to love it"
42860,Ewww. I would have been too
42861,Did anyone video it?
42862,"Aw that's awful, how old was it?"
42863,"I hope you're holding up then, I would be devastated if my pet died."
42864,yea thank god he didnt go to the GSW
42865,yea i bet they are
42866,you have eyes too
42867,Have eyes for someone else
42868,oh yea i know how that feels
42869,it really does suck
42870,"that movie scared me to death, and i usually dont scare very easy."
42871,oh my lord!!! how did you sleep that night?
42872,Oh no!  What happened/
42873,"Okay good.  I think everything is going to be okay!  Keep your head up, friend!"
42874,Was she really sick?
42875,Eggplant is gross but hey now you know! lol
42876,I can't either!  I tried it once and I'm like you......NO MORE!
42877,That's so messed up! Why was he doing that?
42878,"Good to hear, how old was he?"
42879,ME too. Marvel movies are the best. Im late I just saw wonderwomAN
42880,OH my word. I feel like I should watch them all over
42881,is he sick?
42882,Does he has any record with heart problems?
42883,oh wow that really sucks
42884,dang that is rough
42885,That's so sad! Did he at least die of old age?
42886,"I'm so sorry to hear that, may he rest in peace."
42887,Is that because you just like being organized?
42888,"That is really a good way to be. I need to practice this more, myself!"
42889,"Bed is always a source of comfort for me. Especially, after work when I feel so drained and stressed out"
42890,"Indeed. Particularly, when i grab my phone and watch short clips from my favorite TV shows on Youtube"
42891,aw I'm sorry to hear.  Did you conquer your loneliness?
42892,I'm glad you were able to adjust.  It can be lonely without family around.
42893,oh no.. why are you feeling that way?
42894,That sucks.. Are you having trouble falling asleep?
42895,How did that go exactly?
42896,She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.
42897,i dont blame you! i would have also!
42898,nasty! did you tell him anything?
42899,Oh wow! I am so sorry that happened to you.
42900,I would have called the cops on her!
42901,That must have been a very big man.
42902,"thats so nice, love when that happens"
42903,"that nice, good for you"
42904,oh yea whys that?
42905,oh that makes a lot of sense
42906,What do you plan on doing today?
42907,I want some of whatever you had for breakfast. You seem very happy.
42908,Sorry to hear that! Why do you think that might happen?
42909,"Hopefully that doesn't happen, and you have job security."
42910,That's pretty embarrassing haha. Ever find out what it was?
42911,"That would make sense, though you could probably have smelt it if it was coffee."
42912,Oh damn that's so sad. Was it salvageable? 
42913,"It definitely sounds that way, gonna upgrade it?"
42914,oh yea i had those out 2 years ago it sucks
42915,yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything
42916,im glad i still have mine around.
42917,exactly what i do. we were never close growig up. we are now.
42918,"Wow, what is chiller theatre? I'm intrigued."
42919,Must be fun but unnerving as well. Whats your favourite horror movie?
42920,Your best friends?
42921,really what kind of sweets did you eat?
42922,I love cookies especially oreo's they are my favorite
42923,That is nice to have good memories.
42924,Did you go with your cousins?
42925,I was too
42926,"No, I don't get any golden opportunity. did you  ? "
42927,Don't worry. Earn for it and go!! 
42928,Oh no. Floodwaters can be devastating. Was there a lot of damage?
42929,Good thing you were prepared.
42930,Did yall make up
42931,That is not good
42932,Will you get to make it up?
42933,I am sure you will find time
42934,"Oh wow, how did he do"
42935,That is so cool
42936,That sounds like something that could really show off your talents.
42937,That's great! Hope your hard work pays off.
42938,How expensive is that to go to?
42939,That is not too bad if you had a good time though
42940,The loss of a pet is heartbreaking. I know how you feel. How old was Trevor.
42941,Life is hard. But remember he didn't die he went to his forever home.
42942,Sorry to hear that.  Have you since been able to overcome your loneliness?
42943,I understand feeling like a duck out of the pond.  Glad to hear you've made progress.
42944,"Don't feel nervous, you need to be confident!"
42945,"It's hard to push that feeling away sometimes, I know."
42946,That's exciting! I'm guessing you're a Lakers fan?
42947,What team was he on before?
42948,"I understand that, I will pray for you"
42949,"That makes sense, I wish you both the best of luck and health!"
42950,"Wow, great job so far, kep up the great parenting!"
42951,Wasn't that out a long time ago? It must've been super scary if you still remember it.
42952,"Wow, I wouldn't have been brave enough to do that!"
42953,"Yes, it is hard to see people with things you can't afford to buy for yourself."
42954,"Yes, I like the color red as well. I have actually own a couple red sports cars."
42955,It is great to be thorough and prepared. Are you expecting to perform well?
42956,"Thats nice, i wish you the very best for your results!"
42957,I can see why! That's highly inappropriate.  
42958,You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you
42959,"Oh wow, that is going to be such a sweet experience!"
42960,That is very true. I sincerely wish you both to have a wonderful time!
42961,I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have things of hers that remind you of her often? 
42962,That is beautiful that you have those things of hers. Mothers are very special people.
42963,"I have been to that, it is such a wonderful experience. You are going to love it!"
42964,You seem to have a great taste in spending your free time. I wish you get to have a splendid time in there!
42965,I'm sorry to hear about that. How did he die?
42966,yeah I bet. Im sorry for your loss
42967,How did you hurt your back?
42968,Ohh wow! I hope it gets better for you
42969,Did you ask him to replace it?
42970,"I agree with you there, I would ask him to pay honestly"
42971,That's nice. How  do you like the dog?
42972,That is so sweet. My apartments don't allow pets
42973,"That is for sure, especially a smell that just throws you back"
42974,"Exactly, sometimes I just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid, life is great sometimes"
42975,That stinks. Im sorry to hear that
42976,I bet! It seems like fun
42977,Congratulations. Fun plans?
42978,Awww. I'm jealous lol
42979,Awww. Did you keep it?
42980,Thats great. I know he appreciates it
42981,That's great. I hope you do well!
42982,how old was it
42983,they live that long ? interesting
42984,Well congratulations! That must have been nerve-wracking.
42985,That stinks. Maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve
42986,Do it! I bet you deserve it
42987,Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?
42988,Well I am glad it worked out
42989,What did you find?!
42990,"Oh no, are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?"
42991,"Remind me, which show was that?"
42992,That's so cool!  I'm gonna have to check it out
42993,That's nice. Are you going to hang it up?
42994,"Great, you've found an old treasure."
42995,"Just try and get through each day, one at a time. Don't think too far ahead."
42996,That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?
42997,"If this were a movie, I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there."
42998,I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?
42999,What test?
43000,That's great. Is that your only son?
43001,I'm sure the memories will be great
43002,Oh wow! Hopefully no one saw it
43003,Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes
43004,What is it called ?
43005,"Okay, well I guess I'm happy for you then."
43006,That's understandable.  How receptive was he to your complaint?
43007,"Oh, so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries."
43008,Did you find anything?
43009,I bet that was very nostalgic for you.
43010,That's a hard hit to take.  Why do you suspect they got it?
43011,So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?
43012,What did you mess up?
43013,I'm sure you'll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?
43014,I wouldn't worry too much about it then.  Don't let it get you down.
43015,"Wow, that's nice. I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!"
43016,"I guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have, lol. Wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!"
43017,"Well, it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'."
43018,How fun! In a tent or an RV?
43019,Don't forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!
43020,"Ugh, that's so annoying.  How long did you have to follow behind them?"
43021,I hope you weren't late for anything important!
43022,memory lane right there! which cartoons? 
43023,Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.
43024,That would creep me out too what kind of calls?? 
43025,Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird. 
43026,Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?
43027,Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.
43028,"Congratulations, that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!"
43029,"Hope you treat yourself to celebrate, you deserve it!"
43030,That sounds amazing! When will you find out? 
43031,You sound positive so I am sure you will get it!!! 
43032,"omg, that's so scary! are you okay? did you call the police?"
43033,that's good to hear! people are crazy
43034,I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then
43035,I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.
43036,That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?
43037,Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?
43038,"That is great! Adopt, don't shop! Always a great motto!"
43039,"That is great, I commend you!"
43040,Have you prepared enough for it?
43041,Well Im sure you be fine. Just relax.
43042,That's good to hear! Have you been eating healthy?
43043,That's great! Keep up the good work!
43044,"thats strange, my dog will eat anything lol"
43045,maybe he will start warming up to it soon
43046,About what?!
43047,That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.
43048,thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return 
43049,Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier! 
43050,Did you study for it or are you winging it?
43051,Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!
43052,Maybe you should try and have a party?
43053,Yes being alone is not very fun.
43054,What will your new age be?
43055,"You should have a great time, congrats on the new age!"
43056,I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?
43057,"If your depressed, speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change, that comes in time."
43058,Why is it that you are in trouble?
43059,Can you just replace the document?
43060,I would be reporting that to the police for sure. 
43061,Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane. 
43062,Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.
43063,I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.
43064,That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?
43065,"Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place, you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything."
43066,"Aw man, that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?"
43067,I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!
43068,That is amazingly lucky! good for you!
43069,That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!
43070,Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he? 
43071,Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :( 
43072,I would be so excited! Did they pay you for it? 
43073,Hopefully! that would be so amazing! 
43074,"That sounds like such a fun, peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool, it's been scorching outside!"
43075,"Ah okay, nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast, so hold onto these moments while you can:)"
43076,"Aw, well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then."
43077,Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.
43078,I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?
43079,That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.
43080,Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself. 
43081,Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol 
43082,Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?
43083,Well at least you managed to save him!
43084,"Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?"
43085,"That's the worst! Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles."
43086,Did it feel good to get it out?
43087,"Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?"
43088,"That's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work."
43089,"Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!"
43090,I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.
43091,"Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change."
43092,You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!
43093,"Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!"
43094,"Oh no, I am so sorry. What did you do?"
43095,That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?
43096,"Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?"
43097,I hope you all have some fun.
43098,"Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!"
43099,"It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!"
43100,"Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days."
43101,"Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!"
43102,That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.
43103,It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.
43104,oh that was nice of them
43105,haha thats pretty fun
43106,"Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?"
43107,"Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!"
43108,That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!
43109,I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!
43110,That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?
43111,Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?
43112,"Oh no, what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!"
43113,"Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!"
43114,Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?
43115,You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.
43116,"lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla, if you feel like it!"
43117,Exactly!
43118,yea i would be to
43119,Nostalgia is a weird feeling.
43120,"Nice, what do you have planned?"
43121,"Sound great, I'm happy for you!"
43122,Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!
43123,Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.
43124,What are some things you will bring?
43125,It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.
43126,What is wrong? Are you okay?
43127,I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.
43128,We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.
43129,Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.
43130,"Oh my goodness, I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!"
43131,"Ditto. It's not hard to do, and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!"
43132,"Wow, congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?"
43133,"Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding."
43134,I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.
43135,Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.
43136,Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.
43137,That is true. It puts things in context.
43138,That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. 
43139,It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. 
43140,"that is frustrating, especially if the weather isnt ideal "
43141,"that is unfortunate, im sorry that happened!"
43142,That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?
43143,Are you going to get another cat?
43144,I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!
43145,I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!
43146,That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.
43147,That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.
43148,8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!
43149,Have you been a long time runner before that?
43150,"I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!"
43151,"Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?"
43152,"Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large."
43153,Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?
43154,"Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!"
43155,Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!
43156,oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat
43157,"That's good on his part, how do you feel about it?"
43158,"That's awesome, and I agree, the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not."
43159,Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?
43160,That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.
43161,"It will be okay. It's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it."
43162,I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.
43163,Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!
43164,"Good luck, I'm sure you will do fine!"
43165,Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. 
43166,"It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in. Be strong!"
43167,You only get to do it once?
43168,Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.
43169,Congrats!
43170,Was it more than expected?
43171,"That has happened to me, but with texts though lol"
43172,Did you apologize?
43173,LOL
43174,what's wrong with it?
43175,can you fix it?
43176,That is great news. Have you also been working out?
43177,Has it been easy or hard to do that?
43178,did they notice it was missing?
43179,well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.
43180,Ohh wow! Are you excited?
43181,Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though
43182,"That's very creepy, did he say anything to you?"
43183,"Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all."
43184,Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.
43185,Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!
43186,"I've never understood that, it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?"
43187,"Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag, maybe they will leave it alone."
43188,You definitely can't be too careful these days
43189,how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?
43190,"Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality, and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased."
43191,"Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat."
43192,Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!
43193,Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it. 
43194,"What! First of all, are you alright?"
43195,"Oh, well that's something, at least. I can't believe people are such cowards, though."
43196,That's great. Do they know?
43197,Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either
43198,I have never run a marathon
43199,You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one
43200,Well that's some sort of motivation lol
43201,Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?
43202,"Oh geeze, I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?"
43203,Have you tried to talk to your teacher?
43204,What school is this you are talking about?
43205,That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.
43206,"Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you, I have over $40,000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!"
43207,I can understand that.
43208,"You must love him very much, that's good."
43209,"Aw, it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time"
43210,The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!
43211,"that is really nice of you to do, not a lot of people help others like that anymore"
43212,"same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help, i will most likely bring it to you"
43213,"Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more, or who has better connections, and not actual merit. If you're good, I'm sure you will get recognized at some point."
43214,"Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough."
43215,Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you 
43216,I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds
43217,Did she say thank you?
43218,"What a lovely woman, and you're lovely, too!"
43219,That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!
43220,"Yeah, those were better times. Brings back good memories."
43221,"Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day."
43222,Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?
43223,I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.
43224,"sounds like you ate a delicious dessert, what did you eat?"
43225,that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert
43226,O? That's a brave and noble decision.
43227,"That's hard but great of you to do, good luck."
43228,Where will you be shopping?
43229,Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?
43230,hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing
43231,did you still eat it? or did you throw it away
43232,That's nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them
43233,"Well, I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care"
43234,Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?
43235,"It depends, if you love her, you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too"
43236,O yea? I
43237,I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!
43238,I've cheated on occasion. It's never right but it's easy. At least you're ashamed of it.
43239,"That's your decision to make, but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation."
43240,That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?
43241,I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.
43242,you must be loving it
43243,"true that, you cant be too sure until you use it"
43244,Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?
43245,Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem
43246,Oh no! That has so happened to me before! It was only by a couple dollars a month but I SO needed those couple of dollars at the time. I would be MAAADDD
43247,Call the bank and get it fixed ASAP! That's got to be so annoying for you!
43248,I buy those like twice a year and never win.
43249,Wow! That's awesome! What did you do with it?
43250,"Hey, why not? It's unexpected money!"
43251,Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then it's all downhill from there.
43252,Where was she?
43253,Does she have a new ex now?
43254,I would not put up with it either 
43255,"i love when the rain his the soil in the open field , the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing"
43256,I bet you are. What are you going to do? 
43257,sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it 
43258,Why is that 
43259,You will be alright buddy
43260,What have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?
43261,"That is great, well there is still time to go this year!"
43262,I love it when it's nice out. Are you going to do something outside?
43263,That sounds great. A nice long walk in perfect weather. There's hardly anything better.
43264,Are you excited for him or jealous? lol 
43265,I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his. 
43266,Can you report the caller?
43267,"Be sure to do it, otherwise they could keep harassing you"
43268,What class is it for?
43269,I never took chemistry. Do you feel prepared for the test?
43270,That's great.  Have they always been as supportive as they are now
43271,nice.  what do you do for a living
43272,Have you thought about spraying your garden?
43273,Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try
43274,"Same here, I'm in Texas.  Where are you located"
43275,"Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here"
43276,Were you able to get inside fast?
43277,Oh wow! That would be annoying!
43278,How did they get off work midweek?
43279,That would be nice but not fun that you don't have the same days off.
43280,where is your favorite place to go?
43281,"i can imagine, i hope you have a great time this year"
43282,"I remember when my first child started, I was a nervous wreck."
43283,"So they don't even have teachers yet? Wow, that's crazy."
43284,Have you tried getting out and meeting new people?
43285,What about online friends?
43286,that would hurt my feelings. are you alright?
43287,i totally understand that. i'm sorry.
43288,That sucks! Did you have a spare on you?
43289,That's understandable. What kind of project was it? Were you involved?
43290,That's so generous of you. It's people like you that make the work week bearable!
43291,"That's okay, I'm 25 and still in college. How did it go for you? "
43292,That's awesome. I'm glad it worked out well for you. :)
43293,Oh wow. I would have been so scared. more of a stranger than the storm
43294,Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there
43295,Did the ads bring up good memories I hope?
43296,"I have absolutely no idea what Boglins are, but I'm sure they were awesome!"
43297,Sounds frightening! Was this off the coast of a beach or something?
43298,That is one of my greatest fears. Did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?
43299,Great to hear that you made it out ok!
43300,"Well, I can understand that. It's very hard to be on a very strict diet, without a break here and now!"
43301,"Well, i am sure you are disappointed, but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. It's hard, I know!"
43302,Is this a career change?
43303,"Oh hey, I'm a nursing graduate! It'll be difficult at first, but you'll get the hang of it."
43304,"Aw, that sucks. Did you give her a proper burial?"
43305,"Awwww, I am so sorry. Have you thought about getting a new pup?"
43306,"Yea, a new job is useless pretty stressful."
43307,It will be ok in the end.
43308,Oh that is a real bummer. Were you hurt?
43309,Ok glad you did not get injured. I hope your car gets fixed.
43310,Well that's good. You never know what to say in that situation
43311,I wish yo the best
43312,That must of been fun to go through.
43313,That is cool. Is your mother still alive?
43314,What was?
43315,Really? Did you manage to cope?
43316,And was there?
43317,you ever ever plan to get another ?
43318,"Really, how did they do it?"
43319,Amazing! Well done to him.
43320,"Well done, at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now"
43321,"Heat wave is getting so terrible theses days. I even watched on CNN that the whole of New South Wales is experiencing a drought, so sad"
43322,That sounds unfortunate. You must have been so annoyed with him!
43323,People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!
43324,Do you have daughters of your own?
43325,yea traffic sucks
43326,well yea thats true
43327,Same here. It reminds me of my childhood for some reason.
43328,"Exactly, i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes. "
43329,I bet! Did it turn out nice?
43330,That's good... I can't wait for my vacation!
43331,That's terrible! Did the dog survive?
43332,Maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger... by beating him up!
43333,"What I do is to write all the good things I did within the week, I think you should do the same"
43334,i agree with you buddy
43335,You must have prepared really well. Did the trip go well?
43336,Sounds like the trip went well. I am glad you enjoyed it!
43337,all the time
43338,its just life
43339,"Nice, what breed is the puppy?"
43340,I have never heard of such a breed. Must be so cute! 
43341,i do that all the time. i live on the mexican border. what border did you cross?
43342,glade all was well
43343,Cool! How did it go?
43344,Great! I hope you get the job. I'll be rooting for you!
43345,He sounds pretty strong. Any reason in particular that he did that?
43346,No kidding. Definitely some quality entertainment for dinner time!
43347,I hope you both have a great time!
43348,oh how does it go
43349,its ok you tried your best 
43350,Well that is great and sad all at the same time. How far away did she move?
43351,Aw well that is normal. I'm sure she didn't want to leave. Every day will get a little easier.
43352,"Oh my goodness, that sounds terrifying."
43353,I'm glad that you are okay.
43354,i bet that was quite the blast from the past
43355,yes they do. mine are already out of college
43356,"Oh, are you going on a trip?"
43357,That sounds like a fun time.
43358,I am so happy for you! Congrats!
43359,That's fun
43360,Oh no! I'm so sorry! It's so difficult to lose a pet.
43361,I hope in time you are able to feel better.... and that your heart will be filled with happy memories.
43362,That's awesome! Happy belated birthday! What did she get you?
43363,Sweet! I really like Ducati's they are beautiful bikes.
43364,Did it rain a lot?
43365,That must be really scary to go through.
43366,That sounds like fun! What happened?
43367,"Yeah- I understand that. I don't let anyone drive my car, either. I hope everything worked out okay!"
43368,That seems like it would be a little awkward to me..
43369,"Well, they sound like they are actually just a nice person trying to help you out, that is really nice."
43370,That's always a nice find.
43371,I bet it was! I love looking at photo albums
43372,That is nice. Did you start playing guitar with him?
43373,I am also working from home from time to time. I could feel some time lonely.
43374,I usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely.
43375,"Oh, that must have been so embarrassing. "
43376,I'm sorry it happens to us at times.
43377,Congratulations! That is so cool!
43378,I hope you have fun with that money.
43379,I can't believe your coworker would do that to you! Did your manager listen?
43380,I wouldn't be either. Are you going to try to talk to your coworker about it?
43381,OH wow! I bet you all had a blast!!
43382,They will really appreciate that when they are older and look back on it. 
43383,"oh god, what do you do at that time"
43384,how did you feel at that time
43385,Oh wow! Are the babies ok?
43386,Good thinking. I'm sure the parent bunnies appreciated that.
43387,Oh man. What a bummer!  I love cucumbers and hummus!  Do you have anything else you're growing that survived?
43388,"Oh good, I'm glad the entire garden didn't get ruined.  I would love to plant a garden one day soon since I went vegan plant based about 3 months ago.  Happy tomato eating to you!"
43389,Oh what a mess. I would hope that they picked it up.
43390,Well at least they cleaned up after. I would have been more annoyed if they didnt.
43391,Could you tell me what you have done?
43392,"That sounds great, I hope you succeed."
43393,That's great news! Congrats! My garden is not doing great this year. Do you grow anything else?
43394,Yum. I wish I had a green thumb. 
43395,"That's awesome, It is very hot where I live, so I am jealous!"
43396,Well I'm glad you get to enjoy some nice weather for a change!
43397,where exactly are you cos it rained all through in my area?
43398,ok im at the south east
43399,ohh wow! That's not cool
43400,I wish people would take responsibilities for their own actions
43401,Oh man! Hopefully nothing broke! 
43402,At least it sounds like you recovered everything! 
43403,He accused me of stealing from him
43404,"Sorry, that was an error! Any way over to your conversation.Who did you cut off that made you feel bad?"
43405,Yea I hear ya. Im stuck here at work for another day too.
43406,I just hope it doesnt rain this weekend.
43407,What is the test on? Have you prepared for it? I bet you will do better than you think!
43408,Good for you! I bet you will do amazing. Best of luck!
43409,i feel the same one and lately it seems to be getting worse. i've never been brave enough to go eat alone.
43410,i get that. i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday.
43411,Me too! I'm stuck inside at work and hearing about how great it is out there.
43412,"Haha, same! Just one more hour for me. Hope you can enjoy it soon!"
43413,"That is not good, what happened"
43414,"That is never a good thing, I hope they land on their feet"
43415,"Oh, well that is a nice surprise though!"
43416,"That is nasty, how do they get away with that?"
43417,"Exactly, I would report them, so nasty"
43418,"I hope so too, get it checked out!"
43419,Sorry to hear that. It would really upset me to be in that situation!
43420,I hope you win that one! Good luck!
43421,"I am sorry for your loss, at least you got some time together"
43422,"I feel that way about my grandma, it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old"
43423,I think lyft is better
43424,"oh, I am sorry to hear that, why did they move away?"
43425,They sounds very complicated
43426,That is nice to have
43427,having friends over is always nice!
43428,i bet. hope you all have a fantastic time!
43429,Are you guys in good relations?
43430,did it bring back a lot of old mermories?
43431,thats good that you have progressed
43432,"She is a crappy person, flirting with someone who is in a relationship. Good on you- stand up guy"
43433,Lol- Well poor you. I have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me. If I am in a relationship..or heck even when I am not..I don't get interested in random people generally. I have to know who someone is..Remember that- what lasts is WHO someone is...Someone you want to grow old with..Bodies won't last.
43434,That must of been weird. Who was it?
43435,Was it suppose to scare you?
43436,Well I hope it lasts forever
43437,That's good! I guess you studied a lot?
43438,That's good. I am sure you will do great on it.
43439,"Ouch, that sounds pretty gross!"
43440,I'd avoid that taxi driver again if you have the chance.
43441,I hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up.
43442,"Yes, don't let that stop you. Also pay attention to what you eat as well. It's even more important than the exercise portion."
43443,I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing. Which is it?
43444,That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.
43445,What was it I wonder?
43446,It must've been nasty like puke
43447,"I like that philosophy. Here lately, has it been easier or harder to stay positive?"
43448,"I like that, how long have you felt this way about life?"
43449,"wow, its good to warm"
43450,it is easier to walk around when its sunny also
43451,What exactly did he do>
43452,"Yes, some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs."
43453,Wow! I bet you two are very excited! 
43454,"That is wonderful. Our first vacation after getting married was full of fun, sun and adventure. Those are the best! "
43455,You sound very confident. That's good
43456,I know what you mean. Just believe in yourself
43457,Is he being too noisy?
43458,"I see how that can be annoying, have you asked him to stop doing that?"
43459,You weren't excited about it?
43460,I understand. Stress is a definite mood killer
43461,ive always wanted to have the eye surgery. im ready to get rid of my glasses and contacts
43462,im glad you feel happy about it
43463,It's good to believe in good things.
43464,"Yes, I like your attitude. "
43465,it's true there's nothing like the good old days
43466,i'm glad you were one of them!
43467,I know how you feel. Do you have a big trip planned once you receive your passport?
43468,I hope you enjoy your adventures!
43469,I hear you. I had the same experience after just 5 years
43470,I understand. She took my daughter with her
43471,What subject are you trying to pass?
43472,"I love math, good luck with your exams than."
43473,why were you acting like that?
43474,i'm glad you were in a good mood.
43475,Did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way?
43476,"I understand how that can make you feel a certain way. Unfortunately, there are those types of people around every corner."
43477,Oh Wow! 20 years at your job! You must be well liked there. 
43478,It must have been a wonderful surprise for you.
43479,"Oh my goodness, what was the terrible news?"
43480,"I am so sorry, I hope your brother ended up being okay."
43481,"Dang, that's not good. What did you end up doing??"
43482,Oh wow. Did the police get called? I hope you didn't get in trouble. 
43483,Yeah? What is changing?
43484,Brilliant. here are you going?
43485,Amazing! and Exotic
43486,That's so generous of you. The world could use more people like you.
43487,Caring for both the young and the old. Any hospital would be lucky to have you on staff!
43488,"Oh my, how did she react?"
43489,Ha! Do you feel bad about it?
43490,It certainly can. What type of job are you looking for?
43491,Maybe they had lots of other candidates to see
43492,I know that feeling. Something will come through though
43493,Yes! I feel like the day escaped me. Have you done that recently?
43494,"It is Friday, that would be a nice way to start the weekend!"
43495,"Ugh I can imagine. But your time will come, be patient!"
43496,Have you tried yoga? It can help in the meanwhile till you get a proper vacation.
43497,Oh no! Did you get the surgery?
43498,But you have recovered now. Right?
43499,Are you pregnant? 
43500,Congratulations! That's brilliant news
43501,Good job! Do you feel proud of yourself?
43502,Hard work always pays off! Keep it up.
43503,Man! That's pretty bad.
43504,i hope it goes well for her
43505,good luck!
43506,Awesome! Glad that you did well on the exam!
43507,Now you can celebrate this exam result! Always feels good to accomplish something like this.
43508,oh wow. that is some scary stuff!! what happend?
43509,did they catch the person?
43510,You shouldn't like to your mom. I think you should tell her the truth about what really happened.
43511,That sounds like a great idea!
43512,Oh no! You have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail
43513,"That's good! Practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed, we would not have as much as we do today"
43514,That's terrible. Did you let others know that you had completed the job?
43515,I could imagine. Some people stoop low to take credit for what others do.
43516,what kind of surgery was it?
43517,Thats awesome! Its great to have friends their for someone.
43518,Oh no! Did you scold him?
43519,"I'd be angry too, but it's hard to get mad at doggos."
43520,Congrats to you!  What kind of nurse are you looking to be?
43521,I have no doubt that you will be a great RN!
43522,"That is awesome, what is his secret?"
43523,Being debt free can be a great feeling
43524,Im sorry to hear that. Does she have a job now?
43525,Well that was nice of your boss. Its great to have good people in this world
43526,I hope this is the true love for you
43527,You got this just be yourself and professional obviously and don't over think it. 
43528,You will get it happy thoughts only and if not something better is in store. 
43529,It sounds like you are a great parent.  Does she appreciate all the help you give?
43530,She will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too.  I still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years.
43531,Im sorry about that. How did you find out?
43532,That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?
43533,Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?
43534,That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.
43535,"I understand! As we get older, it's hard to do it all everyday!"
43536,"It happens, but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you"
43537,"Oh no, are you able to afford the repair for it?"
43538,What a great friend you have. Definitly get him a gift when you are done.
43539,I hope you can too. How is it going?
43540,That's great! I have faith that you can do it.
43541,That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?
43542,"That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that, I'm cutting them up."
43543,That would have really scared me.
43544,I bet you are thankful that your friend was there.
43545,All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?
43546,Haha I bet. Im sure they were looking forward to it.
43547,ewww.
43548,Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?
43549,You are having trouble with family ?
43550,Mine isn't either. Are you married?
43551,Awesome! What are you going to see?
43552,"Whatever it is, I hope you have a good time!"
43553,Oh no!  How'd you do that?
43554,What were you doing on the roof?
43555,Did you catch anything?
43556,Did you at least have fun?
43557,congrats! you must be proud!
43558,My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go
43559,That is good to feel that way. You don't want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?
43560,Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you. 
43561,"Oh gosh, you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear"
43562,I would have a heart attack! 
43563,I have no idea what those are!
43564,oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?
43565,What are pierogies? a type of food?
43566,"Ah nice, I love dumplings, what are in them?"
43567,"That's no good, did you throw it out?"
43568,Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.
43569,"Oh, I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!"
43570,Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!
43571,This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!
43572,"Oh, I shouldn't be ungrateful, lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!"
43573,Did you get a promotion?
43574,"Wow, great job!"
43575,Oh no!  What has you scared?
43576,It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.
43577,oh dang thats so horrible
43578,it gets better with time but it must be hard
43579,"I remember that store! I loved going shopping there, was it your first job?"
43580,"Yeah, I bet, it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job."
43581,Are you having any specific problem areas?
43582,Okay. I hope you do well too.
43583,"Interesting, those things are huge, Do they even make them any more?"
43584,"Do you have a large family, or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?"
43585,5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.
43586,It is a big change. What is scaring you?
43587,I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in
43588,Is it really far?
43589,oh no. im sorry to hear that
43590,"Well, that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?"
43591,"Well, that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!"
43592,You were ready? That's good to hear.
43593,Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif
43594,I bet. Good luck to you
43595,"Where you supposed to be there? If so, then that is a nice feeling."
43596,Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also. 
43597,That's great. What classes are you taking?
43598,That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?
43599,You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.
43600,Any time. Have a good weekend :D
43601,Did that happen tonight?
43602,"Well, it must've been something you said."
43603,Did she have a party?
43604,Does she have her license yet?
43605,"Well, there's no hurry in driving, is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??"
43606,Does she play any sports?
43607,"That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice, but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better."
43608,"It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!"
43609,You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?
43610,"Well, happy anniversary! What was your present?"
43611,I agree.. Did something happen?
43612,I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.
43613,That was nice
43614,Do you have anything in mind?
43615,"So, I take you left to live someplace else?"
43616,"Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!"
43617,"Very nice, congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?"
43618,"I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon."
43619,"That's great, it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud."
43620,"Well, hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future."
43621,I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?
43622,That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?
43623,Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?
43624,"It's a huge step, congratulations! "
43625,Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.
43626,Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.
43627,Is he sick or just being lazy?
43628,I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.
43629,"Oh, well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!"
43630,"LOL, well, that's good to know. So am I!"
43631,Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?
43632,"That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition, especially those with diabetes."
43633,Thats... uh... strange?
43634,"I think so, you're two peas in a pod."
43635,"Pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done."
43636,"A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back, then you can get some work done."
43637,Oh my god! That's terrible!
43638,Oh that's so great!
43639,That's amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough
43640,LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it
43641,Oh man! I hope no one noticed. 
43642,I'm glad that it all worked out!
43643,"Oh, I bet you are really torn."
43644,I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.
43645,That's one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??
43646,That is hard! Relationships are hard work.
43647,"That is great of them, did you do anything to pay them back?"
43648,"That is nice of you, glad you have supportive friends!"
43649,Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat :/ 
43650,They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.
43651,What happened to them?
43652,"Good, sorry you were inconvenienced, hope things get more consistent!"
43653,that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.
43654,that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella
43655,Did you study for it at least?
43656,"That is true, well best of luck to you friend!"
43657,That is bad. What did you do after that?
43658,Did he say sorry?
43659,is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?
43660,Oh? What about them?
43661,That's true. Any memory in particular?
43662,Is it really? How hot is it there?
43663,"That is hot, but it is a bit hotter where I live here"
43664,"Did you feel lonely, or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?"
43665,That is tough when you're not used to being alone.  What did you end up doing?
43666,Oh that's cool!  What do you all have planned?
43667,Well that sounds like a fun little trip.
43668,thats nice to be able to relax
43669,everyday is a good day!
43670,Really? You must really like you job then
43671,Good for you! I hope you  have good week!
43672,I am sure you will do fine! Good Luck!
43673,Oh I am so sorry. Best thing to do is be there for her.
43674,I have and it really hard. It just takes time But a good support system makes it way better.
43675,how did she handle it
43676,well that was nice of you
43677,did it help?
43678,congrats! i hope it works out
43679,That was good of you.  He didn't hurt her did he?
43680,Oh no!!! Where did you end up going?
43681,That was so awesome of your mom :)
43682,"That is terrible. Those days, a lot of people do stupid things."
43683,"Children usually do really well, they are versatile. "
43684,I hope he continues to do well.
43685,Are you excited or will it be lonely? 
43686,Yeah that is scary. I am sure she will do great things though!
43687,I bet it was really quiet and lonely. Did you find some time for yourself though?
43688,I don't think I would like that quiet either.
43689,Well that's not good. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?
43690,Never be too confident! You've got to give life your all at every step.
43691,I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice
43692,Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... it's like we bother them
43693,"How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn, etc.."
43694,I can imagine!  It is certainly an exciting time.  I bet you are just over the moon happy!
43695,Any experience with what?
43696,Yes some things
43697,Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?
43698,"Well, it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break."
43699,Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there. 
43700,Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?
43701,Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.
43702,No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!
43703,Aw that's nnice of her
43704,Moms are the best
43705,Did you kill the snake?
43706,"That is too bad, will you ever camp again?"
43707,Did they do a good job?
43708,Did you take them out for drinks after the meeting?
43709,sounds awesome
43710,i would have loved to do the same
43711,Did you resolve things?
43712,I hope you can get over that pain.
43713,That's awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.
43714,That's great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get $40. But gamble only in moderation!
43715,That is really upsetting!
43716,Well forget them! If they don't care about you you don't need to care about them
43717,for fun?
43718,well that sounds pretty fun!
43719,Were you satisfied with the results?
43720,how did it go
43721,oh well maybe next time
43722,how many days has it been?
43723,Drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general.
43724,Some people can't hold their liquor.
43725,I can imagine. What happend that you got your jaw wired?
43726,Man that sounds aweful.
43727,Nice.  Always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can't touch you
43728,Absolutely
43729,I feel like everyone goes through that phase.  I know I did too
43730,Would you say you're more of an introvert?
43731,Especially in the south
43732,"Oh wow, that does sound horrible"
43733,did you find out the results?
43734,dang thats awesome!
43735,Oh wow and you couldn't keep your job? What were you going to school for?
43736,Oh wonderful! One of the best fields to be in right now
43737,"Wow! Good luck, there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too!"
43738,That is awesome. I never even get a second date A husband may not be in the cards lol
43739,Thats sweet. I bet they enjoyed it
43740,"I hate bad traffic, did you get in an accident?"
43741,"That's the worst, I hate when people are careless."
43742,that sucks. have you talked to her?
43743,"That is awful.  I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well, professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?"
43744,"I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building, communication, and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.  "
43745,"Wow, you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?"
43746,"I see. Well, it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life"
43747,I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?
43748,"At least they aren't gone completely, but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life."
43749,"i would be really annoyed myself, why so many frequent calls ?"
43750,"i know ever since i purchased a new car, i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day , its really annoying "
43751,"I know right! my parents love tennis, so I grw up watching it."
43752,were you ever any good at it?
43753,Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of. Can you bake now for real?
43754,Are you still in contact with him?
43755,Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens.
43756,I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one.
43757,That sounds exhausting! Were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?
43758,I'm sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family.
43759,Was he alone?
43760,Cool. Did you do something special?
43761,Do you get a raise?
43762,Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account
43763,Are you interested in mortgage for now?
43764,Oh that is really gross! Have you talked to her about it?
43765,"If you share the fridge, I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food."
43766,cool. did he have gifts?
43767,Oh. I am lol
43768,Like what? Bad or miserable?
43769,Yes indeed. Seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces
43770,Wow. enjoy your own time.
43771,"Yeah, you're right. Hope you've memorable vacation."
43772,"Wao,thats really not cool"
43773,"He doesnt deserve you,so wipe your tears"
43774,That's sad. But I'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too
43775,Posibly. Sounds like you are better off without him though
43776,"That's awesome, I wish I could build my own house."
43777,Well thank you as well.
43778,Did she die recently?
43779,"Oh wow! Thats so sad, I know animals can be like kids to use. I'm so sorry"
43780,That can ruin a persons life.
43781,That is such a mess.
43782,"Tell me more, sounds exciting! "
43783,Good on you! You finally got recognition for your hard work
43784,What concert was it?
43785,That probably would have been fun.
43786,That sounds terrible. I hope you're okay now.
43787,Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives.
43788,That is so messed up!
43789,I would be so angry.
43790,"Oh wow, What kind of dog was it? I'm so sorry that must've been super hard"
43791,I can imagine. I haven't had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and I'm dreading the day
43792,That's wonderful that you are pursuing a degree. What is it in?
43793,That is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others. You can really make a difference! 
43794,Yeah? Which game was it for?
43795,Nice. The original Spyro is a classic.
43796,Oh no. What did you do?
43797,"Lol, well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?"
43798,That's great. What made it so special this year?
43799,Sounds like fun! I'm glad you had a happy birthday.
43800,I wish you nothing but the best!
43801,It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.
43802,Ouch that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.
43803,Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?
43804,"Oh wow, so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too"
43805,That sounds very bizarre.
43806,I hope you are okay.
43807,I hope this doesn't happen again.
43808,"Oh my, what did you do, may I ask?"
43809,That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!
43810,I hate public speaking too!
43811,Dallas is a really fast city.
43812,"I'm sorry, things will get better."
43813,Thats aweosme! Is he going to be staying with you?
43814,That is terrible. What happened then?
43815,I understand. My mistaske always happened.
43816,Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track. 
43817,That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position. 
43818,You must be really excited for it! Do you think its going to be girl or boy?
43819,"Well, it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy! "
43820,Do you plan do something this weekend?
43821,Yes. It is sometime nice to just rest at home.
43822,That sounds like fun Do you know who haunts it?
43823,"Well, if you promised I would try to go. I'm sure it'll be fine. "
43824,Nice! You must be pretty confident she will say yes.
43825,I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.
43826,That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more. 
43827,"I agree, just remember her for all the good memories. "
43828,Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?
43829,What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety. 
43830,That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?
43831,I understand. The best thing is to move.
43832,That's awful! I'm always scared that's going to happen to me when it's raining
43833,You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be
43834,"Really, where was this parade at? I'm in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday"
43835,I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!
43836,oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows you're normal. There's a lot of people in your boat
43837,whats preventing you?
43838,you sound too kind. You'd be a great dog mother/father!
43839,That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?
43840,It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!
43841,How exciting! She must be thrilled too
43842,I hope you guys have the best time!
43843,That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?
43844,I hate it when stuff like that happens. 
43845,"Haha, nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is."
43846,Sounds like the best course to me :)
43847,That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good. 
43848,You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile. 
43849,"That sucks, sorry to hear that. Did you get a refund?"
43850,Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!
43851,Did it taste good?
43852,Were you suprised that they did this for you?
43853,Wow! How happy you must be. I be that day brought you lost of excitement. 
43854,You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work
43855,"oh so sad , what happened to it"
43856,it must must a very much hard time for you and your family 
43857,"yes , he be rest in peace"
43858,I would be so scared. I think I might have to leave. Did the bears bother anyone?
43859,Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.
43860,Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.
43861,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family. "
43862,You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family. 
43863,That's disgusting. What did you do about it?
43864,Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!
43865,That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.
43866,Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.
43867,Wow good job! SO close
43868,Thats a great accomplishment
43869,maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group
43870,i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump
43871,that should be fun. good luck!
43872,Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?
43873,"I'm sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly, but it will in the end"
43874,Did he take care of it for you?
43875,That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud. 
43876,"That's awesome, what does your hubster do?"
43877,"Wow, I admire his dedication! And you won't ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!"
43878,"Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature, it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated"
43879,Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them
43880,"Oh no, do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?"
43881,I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.
43882,Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?
43883,"Man, you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!"
43884,So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity
43885,Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for
43886,"oh no!! Did anyone notice? it's normal though, we all do that sometimes"
43887,"oh man... It happened to me before, i know how embarrassing it is."
43888,That's great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?
43889,Well at least he passed - that's great!
43890,That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.
43891,"I will do that, i had no idea."
43892,I'm really sorry to hear that.
43893,I can't even imagine to be honest.
43894,I have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.
43895,I'm sure it will be different when it's a parent.
43896,that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?
43897,You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig
43898,you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance
43899,i hope it won't happen! 
43900,Oh no! Did he say anything about it?
43901,"I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly, don't you!"
43902,Awesome! What are you planning on buying?
43903,Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!
43904,Oh no that is crazy!
43905,Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out. 
43906,"I hate those things, i try to not eat those at all."
43907,I eat steak and shrimp.
43908,i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.
43909,i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?
43910,agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.
43911,I love Taylor Swift! She's talented and beautiful!
43912,How exciting for you! Have fun!
43913,You have a test coming up?
43914,Well I hope you do well! Good luck.
43915,That's interesting. What was she doing?
43916,That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business. 
43917,Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.
43918,I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it
43919,Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.
43920,That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.
43921,"Oh no, he shouldn't have gambled. "
43922,"I would've too, but sometimes people need to learn a lesson."
43923,Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?
43924,For real! Are you taking any precautions?
43925,Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?
43926,"Okay, that makes more sense then to me."
43927,Where are you located ?
43928,I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.
43929,Who did what?
43930,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!
43931,Oh no! Why not?!
43932,I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!
43933,Never know who was?
43934,Wow that is aweful! 
43935,"Oh wow, what happened?"
43936,That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?
43937,I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!
43938,Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.
43939,Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!
43940,"That's awesome, I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month, it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?"
43941,"Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair, was always fun."
43942,You must have been sad and angry.
43943,"Yes first heart brake is so hard, I feel for you, something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend."
43944,That's awesome! Congratulations!
43945,No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun
43946,"Ouch, hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it."
43947,"I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha, its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1."
43948,Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.
43949,I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate! 
43950,Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.
43951,"Well, at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been."
43952,"Oh no! That's sad, did he get them all?"
43953,"Aw, that's too bad, hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!"
43954,"wow, so what are you going to do with it?"
43955,"nice, i hope that works out for you... good luck"
43956,"That is gross, I can't even imagine what that would taste like!"
43957,"That's so gross, I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much."
43958,"Omg, Thankfully he wasn't hurt. "
43959,Did yall happen to get it on video? 
43960,"Congrats!, I'm sure you must be very happy!"
43961,"Haha brotherly love, I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!"
43962,thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day
43963,i bet so!
43964,Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?
43965,That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away! 
43966,We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!
43967,Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.
43968,"Did you not want to go out, or did you just not like the movie?"
43969,"Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you."
43970,"Great, when will you know your scores?"
43971,"Wow, that's fantastic."
43972,Who doesn't?
43973,What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!
43974,That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?
43975,Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.
43976,"Oh no, how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!)."
43977,"Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!"
43978,That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.
43979,"Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?"
43980,That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.
43981,Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.
43982,"Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways."
43983,"Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha."
43984,"That is a huge blessing, I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone."
43985,"It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine."
43986,Do they run them all day long - or at night?
43987,"Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is."
43988,I don't blame  you because I hate camping.
43989,Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.
43990,You are lucky to have such great friends!
43991,"oh that sucks, i hope it has healed since then"
43992,"ouch, that sounds awful"
43993,How come? Have you had awful weather lately?
43994,Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!
43995,Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!
43996,"Aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life, after all"
43997,Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?
43998,How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.
43999,"thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them"
44000,me too!
44001,I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.
44002,Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.
44003,That's always a great start to a day.
44004,How are you celebrating it?
44005,Oh wow. What's the exam on?
44006,That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.
44007,Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.
44008,Congratulations! Retail really does suck.
44009,Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.
44010,"Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?"
44011,I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.
44012,That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?
44013,I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.
44014,I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?
44015,That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.
44016,That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?
44017,Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.
44018,That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.
44019,I hope he doesn't let you down.
44020,Something good happen to him recently?
44021,That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.
44022,"Oh no, that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!"
44023,Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.
44024,That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?
44025,I bet. I would've hid under the table.
44026,That's nice. Why do you say that?
44027,That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.
44028,That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?
44029,"Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much."
44030,Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?
44031,Are the good memories at least?
44032,At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!
44033,I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?
44034,That's rough. Why can't you help her?
44035,"Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there."
44036,How long did it take them?
44037,He must of been sick after.
44038,That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time
44039,"Wow, thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal"
44040,Are you going to ground him?
44041,Why don't you join them?
44042,Why don't you get another job?
44043,That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?
44044,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.
44045,Holy cow.  Was anything missing?
44046,Had they gone through anything?
44047,oh yeah that must have been a good time
44048,Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it
44049,"that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation, where do you have planned to go?"
44050,That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck
44051,I miss her. You haven't seen your mom in a long time?
44052,"I'm sorry, but I can't understand what you're saying."
44053,"Oh man! I have been there, I hope you didn't have anything special down there??"
44054,"Oh lord, i am so sorry! I have been there, that is hard!"
44055,"taht sounds like fun, i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah. did you enjoy the party?"
44056,ahahaah seems to be they really like you working threre
44057,"Aww, I'm sorry.  Is he going to be ok?"
44058,I do too.  That's one of the saddest things.  I hope you'll be OK too.
44059,ooops sorry to hear that
44060,oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?
44061,yea you never like to see stuff like that.
44062,did you try to find its owner?
44063,well that was nice of someone
44064,"That's annoying, are you going to talk to them about it?"
44065,I hope it all works out in the end.
44066,Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?
44067,I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!
44068,What is the appointment for?
44069,Let's hope not! My prayers are with her.
44070,You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.
44071,I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.
44072,"Oh man, sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first, but getting to bed early will help with her future."
44073,"Well yea, they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet."
44074,"that is so lucky, they must be so happy they bought that ticket"
44075,i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha
44076,Oh I hope you do well then
44077,wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long
44078,yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say
44079,"that is really nice of him, how much time will you have to wait?"
44080,well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction
44081,"that is horrible, natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them"
44082,"not really, the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm"
44083,I bet that was a wonderful day
44084,I am very happy for you
44085,"that is not good, have you expressed your feelings to your boss?"
44086,"well i hope everything goes well for you, you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry"
44087,"It's a whole new world when that happens, I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?"
44088,It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.
44089,"Oh no, that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?"
44090,May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.
44091,oh that explains it!
44092,Wow when the child just asked?!
44093,I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.
44094,OMG that's so gross! 
44095,"That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way, after all. "
44096,Oh god. That's kinda gross.
44097,Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.
44098,Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?
44099,That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!
44100,"Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada, who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?"
44101,You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast! 
44102,Do you feel ready for it?
44103,"Awesome, hope it goes as planned!"
44104,Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?
44105,"Awww...that's a bit disappointing, but really cool that you got to see them!"
44106,The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.
44107,That would have been awesome if you got it.
44108,That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.
44109,"Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help."
44110,What did they do to you?
44111,It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.
44112,I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once! 
44113,That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha
44114,Do you hike very often?
44115,"I've never been hiking, really! I'd like to go some day."
44116,"Oh, such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!"
44117,Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.
44118,So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.
44119,May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.
44120,That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.
44121,Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!  
44122,"Mmm, now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?"
44123,"Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet, but black forest is amazing too!"
44124,"Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice."
44125,Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
44126,What are some of your best traits?
44127,Do you exercise often?
44128,"Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha, and even if you did, dogs are worth it."
44129,"Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way, I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion."
44130,"I've never been, but it looks like so much fun."
44131,It would be so much fun to go there as a family.
44132,"Oh yeah I am right there with you, I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2"
44133,They are too smart for their own good
44134,what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread
44135,"ewwww, so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it"
44136,or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks
44137,did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel
44138,Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty
44139,That's great! I'm so happy for you!
44140,"Ooh, will you be managing anyone?"
44141,I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?
44142,Ugh! Were you away from home?
44143,"Oh wow, she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you, but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her."
44144,"Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!"
44145,That is a good feeling!
44146,Nice! No kids at home?
44147,Are you afraid of the dentist?
44148,"I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine."
44149,Oh nice! That's super brave of you.
44150,That's a great skill to have!
44151,That must have been a nice feeling. 
44152,I love that nostalgic feeling. 
44153,"Haha, sounds like my pupper, is she still young?"
44154,"Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff."
44155,Why he is working late?
44156,I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?
44157,Aww man that sucks for you 
44158,Hopefully! It is your dream car after all
44159,That should be fun. Any big planes?
44160,That will be nice to catch up.
44161,That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!
44162,"I wonder what could have changed? Either way, I'd be pretty pissed off."
44163,Oh no! That is terrible!
44164,I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!
44165,How do you feel these days?
44166,"It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?"
44167,Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?
44168,Wow! That's like a paid vacation!
44169,"Wow, that's incredible. What's their secret? "
44170,Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!
44171,"That's unfortunate, hope you don't get it as well!"
44172,I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. 
44173,Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?
44174,You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.
44175,Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?
44176,"Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies."
44177,"Yeah, they are cute like that. How old is she ?"
44178,I have a 10 year old like that.
44179,that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding
44180,that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.
44181,you are very welcome. good luck!
44182,That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!
44183,"Yeah, It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look. "
44184,"I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February, so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?"
44185,"I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least."
44186,I am sure she will be smart with it
44187,You can always show her the ways
44188,Were they okay?
44189,At least you're not getting sued
44190,Im good at that lol
44191,Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.
44192,I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.
44193,I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?
44194,I am not sure I would do well in that house
44195,Bet that brought back good memories.
44196,Where did you guys usually go?
44197,whats the competition on ?
44198,"Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further "
44199,I wonder how that was noted on your report.
44200,Sounds like a wacky place to work.
44201,That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.
44202,Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.
44203,Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?
44204,"I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!"
44205,Its so hard to monitor that stuff now
44206,"Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too"
44207,On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?
44208,Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.
44209,No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.
44210,Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.
44211,you havent met all three people in the city yet?
44212,ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head
44213,What kind of job was it
44214,Sales do sound hard to do
44215,Is he going to be okay
44216,"I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain"
44217,That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.
44218,"Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something."
44219,Why? Were they not working?
44220,He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.
44221,Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?
44222,That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?
44223,"Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!"
44224,yea funny how that happens
44225,well at least its being put to good use
44226,Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?
44227,Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?
44228,Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?
44229,Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.
44230,That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!
44231,lol why do you have to steer clear?
44232,ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!
44233,That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?
44234,"Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did."
44235,"It can be hard these days, money is tight"
44236,Did you get it all straightened out?
44237,"Wow that is awesome, too rare in these times, count your lucky stars!"
44238,Oh wonderful!  I'm glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?
44239,"Oh boy, I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!"
44240,That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?
44241,I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!
44242,Bet that was a nice calming down.
44243,Did you get up to anything else fun?
44244,"That sounds awesome, i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need."
44245,Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!
44246,"Oh gross, I would lose my appetite"
44247,"Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether"
44248,"Oh my goodness, that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?"
44249,"They can still bite, so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful."
44250,Do you have OCD?
44251,"I just love when the house is clean, makes you feel good."
44252,That's a bad supervisor. Did you call him/her out on it?
44253,I hope he got in trouble!
44254,Oh most are dreading going back to school. What's your major?
44255,"Nursing can be difficult, but if you have determination and a good support system, I'm sure you'll do great!"
44256,I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.
44257,That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?
44258,Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike
44259,That's horrible. What can people do to change things?
44260,Yes! The weapons thing is so important. 
44261,Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.
44262,I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.
44263,That's great. Getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes.
44264,That sounds like a wonderful place. I'm kinda jealous hahaha.
44265,That's awful! What did you do?
44266,No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?
44267,Woah that's really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.
44268,it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!
44269,"Oh no, that's the worst."
44270,I hope you can get it back somehow!
44271,That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in?
44272,I'm sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!
44273,That is so romantic.  They weren't for any occasion?
44274,Were they your favorites?
44275,Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?
44276,That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.
44277,Wow that must have been amazing!
44278,They're going to remember that forever
44279,"Dang, that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?"
44280,"Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?"
44281,Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.
44282,"Oh, Did something happen to him?"
44283,I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.
44284,"Me neither, but in the end, I really didn't think about him as a dog, he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this."
44285,That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?
44286,At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.
44287,I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for? 
44288,"I don't even know what team that is, haha. Football is lost on me. "
44289,"Oh that's good, last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country"
44290,"I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins, just needed a hardware reset"
44291,"Oh my goodness, is he with the armed forces?"
44292,"I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I can't bring him home quicker, I do want to say thank you to you,  him and your family for your sacrifice."
44293,"That is horrible, did anyone get hurt?"
44294,Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.
44295,That is scary.  What was it?
44296,Gosh It's worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?
44297,Sorry to hear that. What happened on the test?
44298,Hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more!
44299,He must be very smart
44300,It paid off. Wish I was smart like that
44301,Oh no. How old are you?
44302,Is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?
44303,I hope things are better next time.
44304,That's great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!
44305,Lol! Oh geez- so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!
44306,Congrats <3
44307,"Not yours? That is so weird, usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol"
44308,Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! 
44309,"That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though, it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!"
44310,"Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!"
44311,"Oh my goodness, are you alright? I bet you created a mess!"
44312,I hope you can laugh a little about it now!
44313,That sounds like a great gift. That is going to be a great time.
44314,Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.
44315,"I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like, to me, that he lived a long life with you though, and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog"
44316,"That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point"
44317,That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?
44318,I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.
44319,That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.
44320,Someone was watching over her.
44321,How long had you been married ?
44322,Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.
44323,I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.
44324,"Yeah, that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for."
44325,"Cool, what are you getting?"
44326,"That's a nice car, you are going to enjoy it."
44327,Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did ya'll build a fire?
44328,That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain
44329,The 1-6 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.
44330,I bet she was super excited to get it all down.
44331,What grade is she in?
44332,What kind of school was she at before?
44333,Where did you go ?
44334,We went there a few years back. Had a great time.
44335,Awesome news!  What was the response?
44336,Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!
44337,"That's awesome, I bet you were overjoyed with it!"
44338,"You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you, that's true!"
44339,Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?
44340,"Yeah, thieves are terrible.  I mean, who would steal a mower?"
44341,"yea i can see that, it happens but it sucks"
44342,well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either. 
44343,"Oh no, no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even. "
44344,That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?
44345,I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.
44346,spray water over there
44347,"thats good, you should"
44348,Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?
44349,What would you do to them?
44350,"Yea, I used to hate it too."
44351,Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?
44352,is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly
44353,yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games
44354,"That's pretty impressive, does he have any training or just all self taught?"
44355,Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!
44356,That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!
44357,"I am sure he thinks it's his world, the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude"
44358,Well you must be happy about it.
44359,Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.
44360,I hope you hear good news.
44361,I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.
44362,"It was nice of you to buy him food, but I'm thinking he didn't pay you back."
44363,"I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it, and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon."
44364,Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.
44365,Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.
44366,That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.
44367,I bet you had tons of catching up to do!
44368,The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?
44369,"Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be, then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you"
44370,"That is unfortunate, my own mother was ill for several years, she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?"
44371,"Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it."
44372,That was great of him!
44373,He sounds very nice!
44374,Oh really what was the assignment
44375,It's always great to get back positive feedback!
44376,What was it like when it showed up on your door?
44377,"Thats hilarious, You finally got it though uhuh?"
44378,Im sure they had a good excuse.
44379,Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.
44380,Oh crap! how long untill you realized?
44381,"Thats so good, man I have done that a time of two."
44382,I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!
44383,Congratulations. You have done great!
44384,That's really cool. What kind of car?
44385,That  sounds like a really awesome car!
44386,"Aww, that's really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?"
44387,"I was going to say, yeah, that's the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office. How cool!"
44388,Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.
44389,that stinks. what did you do?
44390,and did you find one?
44391,oh that is awesome. and you got a fancy pen out of it
44392,Did it went well?
44393,That is great. What was the issue with your ear?
44394,you made quick work out of that
44395,i wish i could unload that fast
44396,oh goodness. that has happened to me before. i could not sleep
44397,how in the world did it get in your house? were you able to kill it?
44398,OOOOOOOOOO NICE!
44399,Well you two have fun tonight.  I won't tell your parents about all this.
44400,Why you need to thank her? Is she the one that helped you to find the new job?
44401,She is very nice person. That is great.
44402,Oh. Will he be starting elementary school?
44403,"aw he's at that precious age where you have to let his hand go, hu?"
44404,"Damn why'd you have to tell me that...Gawd that's freakin sad, jeezus"
44405,I wish you and your fam peace happiness love and good health.
44406,What? Do you have evidence supporting this
44407,Good hope that bitch goes to hell...sorry I love animals and my mom's dog died the same way
44408,That is a big deal.  What are you going to do?
44409,I would throw trash in their yard.
44410,He sounds like a real hero though. I hope he comes home safe soon
44411,I can only imagine. At least you have each other 
44412,Are you and your family okay?
44413,"I am sorry, you can replace it though"
44414,Wow!  How kind is that!  Their really are kind people left in this world.  How did you respond?
44415,*There* oops.  Did you ever find out her name?  Or find out a way to thank her?
44416,"On no! Did you have to walk, or did you call for service?"
44417,"Wow, you got lucky! Did you give him a tip?"
44418,Why did you feel you had to cheat? I am sure you could have passed if you had studied.
44419,"Well, don't let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on, and do you best not to repeat it."
44420,That's so sad! What on earth happened?
44421,Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your co-workers say?
44422,That is wonderful!  She must be so proud of herself and I know you are proud of her.  Its great that she likes learning so much.
44423,"Awww, what a great idea!  That's so cute! Where are you guys going?"
44424,You are such a good person to do that!
44425,It's crazy how the tables turn!
44426,"Oh my goodness, what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business, am I right!?"
44427,"That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches, that's what I say. Tell me where they're at and I'll roll up on 'em and tell 'em what for. Just say the word. I've got your back."
44428,have you asked your friends for family?
44429,i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them
44430,Oh yeah? And what news might that be?
44431,Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?
44432,"Oh my goodness, that's terrible!"
44433,What do you plan on doing?
44434,uh oh. did something happen?
44435,That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldn't want to go out alone after that. It's understandable.
44436,Do you think you will get the job?
44437,I hope you end up getting it!
44438,"Oh definitely, Youtube is a great platform for these talented people"
44439,"Yeah, my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens"
44440,do you think there something wrong
44441,oh no thats terrible Im sorry to hear that
44442,Me too! I bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night!
44443,"You and I both! No matter who wins, let's promise to split the pot."
44444,"Oh nice, where are you going?"
44445,"Wow, I've never been on a cruise before. I think it sounds like a lot of fun"
44446,Why? What did she do?
44447,She is a special woman.
44448,I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation.
44449,"Oh, he certainly will when he feels the hot, guilty tears running down his face from that strong, independent, jealous filled slap!"
44450,Was any of your stuff damaged?
44451,Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill Moby Dick to make up for the damages.
44452,Exciting! Are you moving to a new company?
44453,Oh fun! I'm so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!
44454,Oh geez! What on earth was it!
44455,That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!
44456,"No way. What happened? If honestly, almost all my days are like this. So, worst has become normal for me"
44457,Don't get it personally. Good performance will always catch other's attention. Just continue doing your work
44458,That's awesome! Always good to be content with life.
44459,It's good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen.
44460,Definately! I have one daughter and twins on the way... I foresee love overload. How many do you have?
44461,"Thanks, Motherhood truly is amazing"
44462,"Not really, do you?"
44463,"Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, i hope it picks up for you, maybe listen to a little music to lift your spirits"
44464,"Oof, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do I guess"
44465,"Well you tried to make things right, you're still a good person"
44466,i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me. are you?
44467,im glad to hear that!
44468,What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?
44469,What concert is it? Are you excited to go?
44470,"OH MY GOD, I'm so jealous, she isn't coming to my city this time. You're gonna have a great time"
44471,"Wow, that will be a busy house"
44472,"That's a great attitude, I hope you and your family stay happy and healthy"
44473,"What did you lie about, are you going to tell him?"
44474,"HAHAHA if anything that is excusable, noone like inlaws!"
44475,How scary! I'm terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here
44476,Well I hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe!
44477,"Wow, that's very nice of him! Was there a lot of people there?"
44478,That's too bad. I hope you had a blast!
44479,That's a good idea! It's always smart to be on the safe side.
44480,I've done that as well where nothing ends up happening but I bought all this stuff. You never know what could happen though.
44481,"That should be fun, what do you plan to do there?"
44482,I am sure people forgot already.
44483,What job is it?
44484,Only one way to find out.
44485,What branch of the military then?
44486,The marines is by far my favorite so good for him!
44487,Oh no that's horrible. Have you complained to the electric company?
44488,I would too at this point. It might be more reliable.
44489,That will be no fun.
44490,Don't you have to be selected first?
44491,That sucks! i hate losing money as well. 
44492,That's how I always feel at those things as well!
44493,I do enjoy the zoo and the animals. I think they could be just as good.
44494,I think it's a good outlook.
44495,Hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own.
44496,"It's a tough choice to make, and not everyone has to raise a child."
44497,i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt. but not sure about the ready for anything
44498,almost? so the situation resolved itself?
44499,What kind of interview?
44500,How exactly?
44501,I bet you needed help to take all the presents back home.
44502,"oh my god, how did you get out of there?"
44503,That's a great asset to have emotionally I think.
44504,Yeah it might just be something you're born with.
44505,I agree. Music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day.
44506,Hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune.
44507,how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?
44508,im glad to hear that. sounds like a great trip
44509,Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I don't mind the rain as long as I'm inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days?
44510,I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun don't mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water.
44511,i can agree with that. i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though
44512,def. make the best of them
44513,It's good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own.
44514,Hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way.
44515,I once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road. It's amazing how much people litter
44516,I wish. People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.
44517,Are you in a dangerous place?
44518,I suppose so. It's great that you value life so much!
44519,Oh no. Did it get ruined?
44520,Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while
44521,Really? So sorry for the lose
44522,Was she sick?
44523,That's a bummer. It's never fun to not win.
44524,Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!
44525,"That's not good, we ended up lucky with who we have "
44526,Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok? 
44527,that's wonderful! I hope you will get that promotion! What do you do?
44528,Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate
44529,"I agree, plus I love making snowmen! "
44530,I always get sad though when they melt 
44531,Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?
44532,"Of course! Well, at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes."
44533,That sounds really scary!  Is your son afraid or is he use to it?
44534,I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.
44535,"That is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications, or meditation to help your nerves?"
44536,"I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped. "
44537,Wow. That's intense. Did your home get any damage?
44538,Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.
44539,That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?
44540,Is that a gaming computer?
44541,Sorry to hear about that. Are the damages covered by an insurance?
44542,I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.
44543,Interesting....did you do it
44544,lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end
44545,Why do you cheat on him?
44546,"Oh I see, why are you still with him then?"
44547,I know how you feel. Are you also spoiled by amazone prime?
44548,"Haha, I know. Especially when I purchase firearms related things like ammunition. It has to ship ground.  1 week for shipping?!?!   rage."
44549,"Yeah, the US is huge, landmass wise."
44550,You can always leave them an angry review online
44551,What did your dog do?
44552,"Oh no, well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit."
44553,That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?
44554,Oh nice! I bet you'll remember that for a long time
44555,I've never been to a concert. I should go see one like you!
44556,that's terrible! how does that make you feel?
44557,"That is the reality of life, unfortunately! That's what you have to enjoy life now."
44558,That is terrible. How long have you had this pet?
44559,Honesty is vey important. I hope she will not feel too bad.
44560,That is going to be so fun!
44561,I am never ready. which diet are you trying
44562,I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started
44563,"your welcome, and I will check out Keto."
44564,My kitties are my family too. Animals are the best.
44565,Exactly! I am glad you have them
44566,"That sounds interesting.. What was it? And how did you find out? And why did he hide it! If you don't mind me asking, of course..."
44567,"Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then, huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that."
44568,how is that working out for you
44569,practice makes perfect
44570,omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it? 
44571,Sounds like a nightmare! total. 
44572,Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?
44573,Well at least you'll always have your memories as time goes on.
44574,that's why i don't watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan
44575,lol no! you shouldn't! that's the best part! Talking smack to each other
44576,Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around
44577,Thats awful! People should be arrested for that
44578,Oh no!  Devastating! I'm so sorry.
44579,That makes me feel ill so I'm sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!
44580,That could turn out expensive. Did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?
44581,"That's annoying, maybe they should provide links for you next time?"
44582,That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating. 
44583,There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just don't like other peoples kids that much.
44584,So i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?
44585,She's must be a keeper then.
44586,That is awesome.  I have never won anything in my life.  What festival was it?
44587,Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?
44588,wow thats awesome.  How did you win them? I never win anything cool.
44589,"aww that stinks, i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money"
44590,That is crazy! How is he still employed?
44591,That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.
44592,I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings. Its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings.
44593,"Thats what best friends are for, after all. I hope things have gotten better for you."
44594,"Gesh, that's frustrating. I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid."
44595,We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.
44596,"That is awe inspiring, very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?"
44597,"I'm sure, that isn't something you see every day, or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented."
44598,"Well, that's great. But you probably should study as well. School is very important."
44599,"Yeah, that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least you're doing something positive."
44600,I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.
44601,"Nope, they only know how to touch screens."
44602,That's great! How long have you two been together?
44603,"You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them, so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent."
44604,Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.
44605,Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.
44606,Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile
44607,I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious
44608,"That sounds pretty amazing, what convention was it?"
44609,"I'm so happy for you, it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!"
44610,That is always so much fun. Which ones made you feel the most nostalgic?
44611,I know how you feel. I feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older I get.
44612,Oh yes? What happened?
44613,"Oh, that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live - they're gorgeous creatures."
44614,That's not much fun. Did he get a new one recently?
44615,"Wow, you're smart and kind! I wouldn't know where to start re. building a computer. Well done!"
44616,What a nice thing to do. You seem to get on very well with your little bro.
44617,"I love my brother, too. He's a great guy. How lucky we are!"
44618,Do you know it was her for sure? That is horrible that you cant trust your own sister.
44619,That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.
44620,I hear you! That sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it's stuff you miss!
44621,Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?
44622,That has got to be one of the best feelings. I love being complimented.
44623,You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.
44624,Dont put too much weight into those advertisements. Sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you.
44625,I know that feeling. Sometimes they can really get under your skin.
44626,Thats nice to hear. Hopefully it makes you two happy. I would just unpack the necessities first and move from there.
44627,Sounds like a plan! Make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!
44628,That would be a great feeling.  Did something happen to make you feel more content?
44629,Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to be thankful for but I know I need to work on just a little bit before I am fully content.
44630,"oh nice! i know that feeling, is it home? what made you think about going there?"
44631,nice! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it!
44632,yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about
44633,yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation?
44634,well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction
44635,Do you think they deserved it?
44636,"Well as they say, ""Better them than you"""
44637,that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress
44638,that is good hard work and determination will always pay off
44639,thats a really good feeling isnt it? anything in particular?
44640,Thats awesome.  Im glad youre happy.  keep the positive energy flowing
44641,Im guessing it wasnt your fault? Do you know whos it was?
44642,That sounds like sabotage to me. Is there any way to prove you werent there? I would be furious.
44643,Did they not ever come?
44644,Man that's a bummer.  I'd visit you but that would be weird.
44645,That is awesome.  What kind of designs are there?
44646,That is very very cool.  I would love something like that in mine
44647,Its always nice getting praise and compliments.  I hope everyone was proud of you
44648,Thats great.  I hope you get a raise too
44649,Like what?
44650,Wow that's really compassionate of you
44651,Are you feeling much more motivated now? What do you want to achieve?
44652,Thats such fantastic goals to aim for in life! I wish you all the best. 
44653,Happy Birthday.  That was so nice of them.  I bet you were surprised.  Was there cake?
44654,"haha that sounds quite messy, but I hope that it atleast tasted good"
44655,"I agree, you need money for everything these days and it controls us."
44656,"Me too, I try not to worry about money so much. There's more to life than that."
44657,I hope your work continues on the path you want and expect.
44658,"Hard work is supposed to payoff, right?"
44659,I know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast. Do whatever you can to try and get enough sleep.
44660,If you get sick you won't be able to work at all so please take care of yourself.
44661,"Wow, that's cruel."
44662,Yeah that is a pretty good mindset to go by.
44663,Just keep it up and you will go far.
44664,that is great! I'm also learning to write code.
44665,HTML/CSS/Java. I'm excited about a career change.
44666,"oh god yes i know what you mean, any ideas what you wanna do ?"
44667,"uhoh, did you get lost?"
44668,oh that is scary.  I hope you were ok.  make sure your doors are locked
44669,what was wrong with it
44670,good luck! we just had our mini cooper blow its engine yesterday .. $12.5k to replace 
44671,Well music does have a really cathartic effect on people.
44672,He can have a great impact on your brain and feeling that is for sure
44673,Wow!  That's a horrible prank!  I would be crying!  What did you do when your friend gave it back?
44674,I would have been really mad as well!  Hopefully he learned not to pull that kind of prank on you again!
44675,I'm sorry to hear that. Do you mind if I ask what happened today to make it so weird?
44676,"Oh, I see. I think I kind of understand. It at least sounds like you're a really self-aware person, and appreciative of the small things, and that you have decent perspective on things. The emotions might be difficult to deal with, but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of"
44677,thats crazy. and scary.  WHat happened?
44678,im so sorry.  I hope youre ok
44679,Getting paid is always a good thing. Were you waiting to get something special?
44680,You deserve one. Did you get it?
44681,"I hate it when that happens! Were they driving fast at the time, it could have been quite dangerous."
44682,"I can imagine, at least you got out of the situation safely"
44683,That's awesome. I think it's great that you stepped up to repay your loans!
44684,"Oh man, well I hope that it was worth it to take out those loans."
44685,"That is such a long time to live in loneliness. I suggest you do, dogs are great companions"
44686,Sounds like a great idea! That would be very nice of you to give a dog a home
44687,"Wow, congratulations!!  Are you guys excited?"
44688,I know the feeling!  My son is a year old so I remember it well haha.
44689,You get a new trim?
44690,"That's awesome, bet you look straight out of 1990s."
44691,What did you guys get up to?
44692,What do you miss the most?
44693,that is awesome. what did he make you?
44694,that sounds yummy. i'm glad you had that special treat.
44695,Do you know what kind of dog?
44696,Those things can really fly on the ground.
44697,Oh no! I bet she was mad as heck
44698,Oh hey! If it works out for you have fun
44699,"Gross! Out of all the bugs that I find in my house, those would be the worse."
44700,"Knowing roaches, they'd probably survive it, seeing as they can pretty much survive anything!"
44701,Oh no! Did he pass?
44702,That's great!! Hopefully he will do good in school this year and not have to go to summer school again!
44703,That's great. Maybe a promotion or a raise in on the horizon?
44704,Well I hope that it goes well for you!
44705,Nice! I hope you get this job if you worked hard for it
44706,Just have faith in your abilities and the rest will come by itself
44707,I'm sure its always fun to view the progress of your creations.
44708,"That sounds nice, having someone prepare a meal for you can be fun."
44709,oh yea.. whats happened since then
44710,oh well that sounds pleasant
44711,Did it feel good to get back out?
44712,How far did you end up running tonight?
44713,Oh wow! Congrats! That's great!
44714,It is it's something we all have as humans it's not defined by gender show off your emotions proud.
44715,It really is why would someone make you feel like it was for girls only especially being young but you are great now.
44716,"He should be ashamed for himself, did he say why he did it?"
44717,"Well, on the other hand you can think of this situation, as if you just paid $500 to a person to never bother you again."
44718,Have you hugged him recently?
44719,"I'm sorry to hear that, he is a brave man."
44720,Did something ruin it?
44721,well thats not too bad
44722,I can't think of a certain moment that the idea clicked. It seems like I've always known they can.
44723,What was that moment for you?
44724,Im sorry but I am laughing. I bet you were so embarrassed. 
44725,I would imagine. Just own it and wear it like a badge. 
44726,Its nice to have the internet
44727,I cannot even imagine
44728,"Sounds very relaxing to me, as long as my allergies don't act up."
44729,I always keep some propolis pills with me just in case.
44730,What happened that made you have to do that?
44731,OH goodness!  Are you ok?
44732,I enjoy sunny weather too.
44733,They must enjoy the rain.
44734,"Oh no, I'm sorry hun. I hope you're at least moving for a good reason like better opportunities. "
44735,Well there is at least one positive. Maybe you could try joining some meet up groups to help you acclimate. 
44736,I do almost everyday I feel like that is a great mindset to have to make your day successful.
44737,They are but to just be able to continue throughout another day is a great feeling.
44738,"I agree, do you have a favorite artist?"
44739,"Yes, he is great no wonder his work is so expensive."
44740,That's good. Did you find out the results of the test?
44741,Good luck on the exam! 
44742,What does providence mean?
44743,"Okay, tell me more about that."
44744,That's great. Does he do photography as a job or a hobby?
44745,Maybe he can turn it into a career and make a lot of money!
44746,"That sounds wonderful!  I've never been on a cruise, I bet you are excited and ready to go!"
44747,"I know that feeling all too well.  Too much to do and not enough time to do it all, and certain things you can't do until the week of.  Hopefully you will get it all done and then you guys will have a great time!"
44748,Wow what kind of dog did you lose?
44749,"That's so tragic I have 3 dogs myself, do you have flyers up?"
44750,"Oof, I hope that doesn't wake you up"
44751,Maybe it doesn't fell very comfortable with having you over and doesn't have any other way of expressing itself
44752,that's cool.  Do you celebrate both of them on the same day?
44753,haha I bet.  That's pretty awesome!  
44754,oh no. did something bad happen?
44755,That;s great. I have always been nervous no matter who drew my blood.
44756,She is going to be great at that job
44757,Oh no. How'd they react?
44758,"I'd be super embarassed, too!"
44759,"Wow, that's horrible, I hope he calmed down after and apologized to everyone"
44760,"Yikes, I would definitely stage an intervention with the rest of your family, let him understand it's not okay"
44761,I remember those
44762,I never had one. I didnt know they were expensive
44763,That's great! I hope you keep getting good reviews like that.
44764,That's awesome. How much do you anticpate the raise to be?
44765,"oh thats cool, is she good ?"
44766,oh that sounds like it will be very rewarding!
44767,a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt!
44768,Oh god. The living room is shared. She should just leave the messiness in her room.
44769,I'm so sorry to hear that. How old is the cat?
44770,All you can do is make sure she's not in too much pain as she goes.
44771,I hope you walked out right then and there!
44772,ah that was really disrespectful of her though. That's not someone you'd want to date long term.
44773,That is good to hear. She should be a big help a lot quicker than normal then.
44774,"That should bode well for her and her future there though, so it was a good surprise!"
44775,How has it been going?
44776,"That is good, hopefully you find your soulmate."
44777,Oh god. Did anything happen?
44778,"Well, I hope nothing bad happened!"
44779,I watched it too! My favorite is Federer. Who is yours?
44780,I have for the past 10 years! It's one of my favorite sports to watch.
44781,That's great. Do you thiink you will get a raise?
44782,Confidence is super important
44783,good luck. even though you don't need it
44784,That's great! You must be happy!
44785,How come he came home early?
44786,That's really thoughtful of you. Do you typically do things like that?
44787,Perhaps I should find the local shelter in my community and do the same. I have never done that before and I feel like I should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity.
44788,Yay! Do you guys have free time to spend together now?
44789,"That sounds great, you should make him dinner to surprise him back!"
44790,How long did that last for?
44791,Why didn't you tell them to move?
44792,You must really miss them.
44793,Yea. Seeing each other on a screen definitely can't beat being with each other in person.
44794,did he catch you doing something crazy?
44795,Thats good lol
44796,That's so sad. Do you have any other friends there?
44797,I am so sorry for you. Perhaps you can hang with her after your workdays?
44798,New York is a fun place to visit.
44799,You will have a blast.
44800,Oh no! was it too short for your liking?
44801,Yikes! I would ask for a refund for sure
44802,Wow! Well a cheat day here and there might be okay! Haha
44803,"Right, but I'd say once isn't too bad as long you stay on track."
44804,I would feel terrible too. Where did you move to?
44805,"I've moved almost half a dozen times in my life before, so I completely understand. Those were rough times."
44806,"That sucks, imagine being in an environment like that all day, I would go crazy"
44807,"I guess some people are just really rude, no matter what position you put them in"
44808,It's hard to trust a GPS. I have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way. Please tell me you didn't do it.
44809,I am so glad that it didn't turn out bad for you. 
44810,"what did he do , how did he react ?"
44811,Well he is the one missing out and  i'm sure your very worthy of attention from some better.
44812,"Why was she upset? Depending on how many people entered, fifth could be really good."
44813,That's still really good! She did better than 25 other people. 
44814,NIce! I bet you cant wait! Do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up?
44815,Very nice! I bet its going to be a good happy weekend. 
44816,"Dang, and here I thought I was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest. Maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big?"
44817,Why stop at 50? We ought to get 100! We need to show your friend and evil corporate Taco Bell who is boss and nab us some consoles!
44818,Did you let him?
44819,You are good to allow him to borrow the car.
44820,"Wow, I really like to do that. I hope you will enjoy it.."
44821,Ah ok. If you try once you will be alright next time..
44822,That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?
44823,That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.
44824,Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?
44825,"That was very rude of her to do that, some people just have no manners."
44826,That's so exciting! Have you run a marathon before?
44827,"That's good, I hope you do well! How did you prepare?"
44828,What a nice surprise! Did something happen or did he miss you!?
44829,I see.I bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together. 
44830,I'm sorry to hear. Why is that?
44831,"Oh, well that is a fine thing indeed! I would be  jumping up and down!"
44832,Sounds pretty lonely. Did you meet or make some friends while out of town?
44833,"Ah I see. Staying focused is hard, especially when your lonely."
44834,That's horrible! Is she going to try again?
44835,It must have been awful to see that in someone you care about. I'm glad she's not giving up.
44836,"wow , thats great. You must be loving it"
44837,You must get a good sleep now to enjoy the New york later
44838,Nice! Were they scratch offs?
44839,I will cross mine too! I hope ya'll win it big.
44840,OMG....that had to be so scary.
44841,I am so glad that you are. Now no more driving when your sleepy.
44842,That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend you're bigfoot while they're trying to sleep.
44843,I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!
44844,That is some exciting news. Do you already know what kind of vehicle you want?
44845,Christmas is coming early. You will have to take me for a ride.
44846,I am sure you will. Good luck for you!!
44847,Whats kind of exam is that?
44848,Don't be. i think you will ace it.
44849,exam's are always scary. we just need to take the mind out of it
44850,Why not block the calls?
44851,Have you asked them to stop calling about this topic?
44852,Have you spoken to him?
44853,Maybe you should buy some earplugs.
44854,I love tennis. Will you watch the US Open?
44855,"It is a great tournament, you should watch."
44856,So are they telling you good news?
44857,Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.
44858,Ooh how nice! Do you have any guesses as to what she may be making you?
44859,Well I hope it's good! Your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that.
44860,You are so lucky to find someone special online. That can turn out so badly sometimes for some people. 
44861,That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.
44862,"Wow, watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone?"
44863,That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.
44864,I am sure with your guidance she will!
44865,"You should go, Otherwise the condition could get worse."
44866,That is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i'm glad they have helped you!
44867,Oh my goodness that sounds so bad! Did they charge you for the visit?
44868,You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.
44869,If I had a bag of M&M's right now I would eat them for sure!
44870,maybe save the other half for later. lol.
44871,"That's ok, it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day."
44872,How did she reacted to the admission to self harm? 
44873,"Now that your girlfriend knows the problem,  the both of you can work on solutions and support together."
44874,Is that like a laser tag place? That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think?
44875,I've played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.
44876,"Oh that sounds worrisome, do you think you will pass?"
44877,"I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly, if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them."
44878,That sounds intensive! How did it go?
44879,I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.
44880,That's a good bright side to look at.
44881,Did you save it or kill it?
44882,It's missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.
44883,"ooh, I bet you can't wait to finish!"
44884,I hope you get it! Good luck!
44885,How did they go? Did you pass?
44886,"Wow! congrats, you should totally be proud of yourself."
44887,That's very sweet! I bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you.
44888,You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. It's always great to find those little pieces from the early days.
44889,Did you get her number?
44890,"Good man, I have a lot of respect for that."
44891,That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!
44892,Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!
44893,Holy cow! Did you call him in?
44894,Oh man!  Do you have a dog?
44895,How come? And was it a pain to replace it?
44896,I hope he did a good job!
44897,"Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation."
44898,How come you didn't collect them? i loved them myself.
44899,"Well, they are expensive and you didn't really miss much."
44900,"Nice, Was it hard to start?"
44901,"Wish i could run close to 5km, i'd struggle with 100 meters."
44902,"That's cool. Man, those tiny disks were easy to lose. what game?"
44903,That's awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well. 
44904,"That sounds horrible, Did you wash it or throw it away?"
44905,"That is a really rough story, You should make him pay for another one."
44906,"damn, is he ok now?"
44907,Did he go to the doctors for help? anyway i'm glad he is OK.
44908,Oh no! Was it a fun night? 
44909,Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad you're okay though! 
44910,"Aww, that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?"
44911,I get that.  It's weird when I forget the name of someone I knew for years.
44912,Poor thing!  Is he felling better now?  I hope he quit that diet.
44913,"Thank god he is ok.  There are very dangerous diets around, better be guided by his doctor."
44914,Were you nervous?
44915,That's awesome.  I'm glad he did so well.
44916,That's lovely! I love waking up to awesome texts.
44917,That's so wonderful to hear.
44918,I bet. I'm not great at being away from my boyfriend.
44919,That's great! What have you been doing to socialize?
44920,What kind of convention?
44921,That's such a sweet thing to do.
44922,Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day.
44923,Lil Peep died? when.
44924,"damn, him and XXXtentacion we're really good."
44925,I love puppies! But they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair.
44926,I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog
44927,"Oh my, that sounds like an absolute blast!"
44928,Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation. 
44929,What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?
44930,Sounds like heaven!
44931,"Aww, I'm sorry. Hope that teacher learned a lesson "
44932,It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?
44933,"Aw, that was so nice! I'd love to find a cat sitter like that!"
44934,How did it go? What'd you get him for a gift?
44935,"It seems like all those years just flew by, huh. At least now he's getting old enough to start remembering all these great times!"
44936,Are you feeling zapped from the week?
44937,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to work through the weekend!
44938,"It never ends does it? I hope you keep your head above water though, it's all you got sometimes!"
44939,I feel that pain. Do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do?
44940,I get that. Well if I could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything. Dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage.
44941,Sure. I love working out. 
44942,How much pain are you on a scale of 1-10?
44943,Dang that sounds bad! I know you might be frightened of going but I think you should go. You'll be better off for it.
44944,That was nice of them! I bet you felt really cool hanging with them. How did it go?
44945,"That is awesome! I love festivals, they're always great to unwind and even just walk around talking to people."
44946,Oh no! You must've felt ashamed. did you return it?
44947,Hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental?
44948,Did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their.
44949,"Its always best to be on time , I hope they understand no one is perfect."
44950,"The journey there is always the toughest, its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it"
44951,With whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! Im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time
44952,"Wow,  that was serious then"
44953,"OK,  so what is your plan now? "
44954,Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends?
44955,Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people
44956,"Oh, that must have been a hard thing to do. I'd hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news..."
44957,"So sad...that makes me want to cry, too, just hearing about her reaction."
44958,I bet it does! Do you go by there often?
44959,I bet it's much different than it was back when you lived there.
44960,Oh no :( Can you tell me? It's okay if it's too private.
44961,Oh my gosh I'm so sorry that really sucks. :( Can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?
44962,Good luck to you! I wish you all the best <3
44963,Oh no why would they do such a thing
44964,Definitely doesn't excuse what they did.
44965,That's not cool. I bet it felt awkward.
44966,You are a stand up person!
44967,"Nice, silence is golden"
44968,Full of what?
44969,"Oh no, was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?"
44970,Hopefully you don't get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling. 
44971,"Oh really, were you supposed to tell them?"
44972,"You can never be to sure now a days, they might post your secret to social media."
44973,Did you ace your test?
44974,"I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately, I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!"
44975,"Nice, what a legend and a gentleman"
44976,"Word, you should ask him what the secret is"
44977,"That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me, the guilt would destroy me."
44978,"Yeah Freud called it Projection, it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well."
44979,It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...
44980,You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.
44981,Did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?
44982,It's good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.
44983,"That's inspiring, has that worked for you in the past in the same way?"
44984,"That's so cool, you seem very intuitive"
44985,That sounds frightening. Did you get home safely?
44986,Why were you walking so late at night?
44987,"Nice, what are some things you realized?"
44988,You don't have me yet <3
44989,"oh god, how did you . have the courage to even go outside?"
44990,that sounds like an adventurous day 
44991,"Wow, how could they do that?"
44992,Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service!
44993,You should. No matter what you can't lie to your Mom. It will always come back on you.
44994,Come clean and fix it. It will make you feel better.
44995,Nice! Do you have any superpowers?
44996,I like your confidence! Fighting!
44997,"oh nice, what kind of memories?"
44998,how does this make you feel like?
44999,That's awesome! You're going to be rolling in the dough with those skills
45000,That's exciting. How long have you been learning programming?
45001,"an interesting one, what does this make you feel ?"
45002,oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?
45003,"That is so kind of you, I also a have a soft heart for animals.  I happen to be a dog person, but I do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends.  "
45004,I can't say I have had any mean dogs as of yet.  My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .
45005,where are you going!
45006,thats awesome i hope you have a good time with her
45007,"Wow, that must've been disappointing."
45008,Oh! So close. Just to think about that missed opportunity.
45009,"Yeah, it's like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same"
45010,"Yup, and I feel there's a part of us that is eternal as well"
45011,I think I would leave if I saw something like that.
45012,Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?
45013,It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.
45014,"I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account, how's school going?"
45015,"Word, college is tough, wishing you the best"
45016, and got upset with you?
45017, And why do not you try to teach your brother?
45018,"Good for you!  I hope it does not stress you out, though."
45019,That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.
45020,"Dang, how fast did you run away?"
45021,Did you tell him how creepy he is lol
45022,"That is awesome, what types of photos did you find? Anything funny or silly? "
45023,"Aww yeah, those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years! "
45024,"It's not fair, eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same? "
45025,"Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of, wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone, someway or another."
45026,"Oh wow, what ovie was it and how did it make you feel? "
45027,"oh wow that sounds very emotional, I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears. "
45028,I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me
45029,"May be you are right. But sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation."
45030,"Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? "
45031,That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! :)
45032,"Oh no, maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!"
45033,"Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too, I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would. :) "
45034,I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?
45035,Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon
45036,"Oh no what happened, are you alright? "
45037,"Oh no that must have been a terrible experience, I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass."
45038,That's what I like to hear! What changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4.0?
45039,wow. that's awesome! you'll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.
45040,It sounds like you're quite the organized person!
45041,I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.
45042,That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :) 
45043,"That is great, I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you! "
45044,"I wouldn't worry too much about it. None of it really matters, if we make a difference or not, we all end up dust in the end."
45045,"If telling yourself that makes you feel better, I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death."
45046,"Yeah, 70s were incredible, the dancing the cars, the women had style and the music was incredible."
45047,"But we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again."
45048,Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.
45049,"There will always be people that are jealous of your success, but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace."
45050,"Oh no, can you return it or get a refund?"
45051,"I am sorry to hear that, I would have felt the same way. "
45052,That has got to be rough. At least it has a home now that hopefully has more time.
45053,I'm sure they will be great to him and he'll bring them joy as well!
45054,OH no! Are you the jealous type?
45055,OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!
45056,oh no do you feel ready for it? 
45057,"That is great, I believe that you will do amazing! "
45058,Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?
45059,"Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon."
45060,"That is great, what has been going on in your life recently?"
45061,"That is good, sometimes that is all you really need to do, get things done  one step at a time :) "
45062,They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?
45063,If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.
45064,That is always frustrating. What happened?
45065,"Wow, some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions."
45066,Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?
45067,What was it that you accidentally ate?
45068,Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?
45069,I'm glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.
45070,"You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody, I agree."
45071,I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?
45072,"Don't be too hard on yourself, it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying, I believe in you!"
45073,I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!
45074,Why not? What happens tomorrow?
45075,Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!
45076,That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!
45077,I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!
45078,I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!
45079,I am sure the procedure will go excellently.
45080,That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!
45081,That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.
45082,He's a brave man. How was the experience?
45083,It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!
45084,Congratulations! Worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!
45085,You're going to kill it this semester! You're going to be so proud when you're walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.
45086,Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?
45087,It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.
45088,That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.
45089,I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.
45090,Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.
45091,Do you get nervous being on your own?
45092,Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.
45093,Im sure your not though! 
45094,Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?
45095,Yeah i would have felt the same way. 
45096,yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.
45097,That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon
45098,That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.
45099,How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.
45100,That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.
45101,Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?
45102,The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! 
45103,"Oh wow, that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again."
45104,That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!
45105,What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.
45106,That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!
45107,That's interesting. Are you okay?
45108,That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.
45109,Why what happened?
45110,Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.
45111,Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then.
45112,That's probably a good idea.
45113,I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?
45114,Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.
45115,"hmmn, really?..i guess you must have felt very bad"
45116,"am so sorry about that, did he apologize?"
45117,Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?
45118,It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. 
45119,Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.
45120,In reference to what?
45121,My husband is my most trusted companion.
45122,That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?
45123,How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.
45124,"That's really nice, however, to keep the marriage fresh and strong, I think it's important for you to have outside friends."
45125,"Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything."
45126,what did you do???
45127,well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers
45128,"stay hopeful! , they'll release it sooner or later"
45129,it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.
45130,That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. 
45131,That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that. 
45132,....what feelings? what are you talking about
45133,"oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?"
45134,"That doesn't sound very good, but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with"
45135,"Other people deserve to have things, too."
45136,"Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell, ""Safe!"""
45137,"Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. "
45138,eh not really. what about you
45139,and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?
45140,i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors
45141,Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?
45142,I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. 
45143,Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. 
45144,"If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on. "
45145,that is great.. may i know what you have learnt
45146,it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it
45147,great day to you too
45148,How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!
45149,You sound very confident! I wish I had your confidence when I was in school.
45150,I bet you will do great! What job is the interview for?
45151,That's a great field. My daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn't been able to find a job yet. Good luck tomorrow!
45152,Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.
45153,Don't get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.
45154,Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?
45155,Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.
45156,Why do you need to go to the doctor?
45157,Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?
45158,That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?
45159,Right. 
45160,Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?
45161,One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.
45162,"I totally understand, I hate carnival rides too, they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?"
45163,"Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me."
45164,Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?
45165,I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?
45166,That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition
45167,I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.
45168,It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.
45169,It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!
45170,"Oh, that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?"
45171,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.
45172,"Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much, its just natural behavior for them, take him to training school."
45173,"Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous."
45174,Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.
45175,I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.
45176,That's awesome!  Congratulations!
45177,Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate
45178,That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones
45179,I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!
45180,"Oh thats heartbreaking, do you guys already have children?"
45181,"I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope."
45182,"Young love, it's such a bittersweet quest."
45183,I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.
45184,It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone
45185,You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!
45186,Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?
45187,That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.
45188,That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.
45189,Is there anything she does specifically for her?
45190,I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?
45191,"Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time."
45192,That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?
45193,That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.
45194,Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?
45195,"Oh, well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol"
45196,"I usually love the trips down memory lane, but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry."
45197,I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.
45198,Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings
45199,"Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!"
45200,"That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly, playful cat too."
45201,"Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased."
45202,"That was thoughtful, sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!"
45203,Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.
45204,My mistake :)
45205,I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!
45206,I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!
45207,Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.
45208,"Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy, hash brown and eggs..."
45209,I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.
45210,I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.
45211,What happened? The yard always has mysteries!
45212,Shocking! Has your kid done that before?
45213,Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.
45214,You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. 
45215,Your welcome! Glad I could help!
45216,"I can understand the feeling, I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. I'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there."
45217,"You'll return to self-sufficiency soon, you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident."
45218,"Aww, that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain."
45219,That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves
45220,"Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example, is it quite tough?"
45221,Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?
45222,Keep up the good work!
45223,I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.
45224,All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.
45225,Living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too.
45226,Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.
45227,Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?
45228,Yeah you might want to look into it then
45229,Oh no! Have you tried taking your dog to the vet?
45230,"Yes, google has a lot of great information for pet care."
45231,Well that sounds like a high stress occupation!
45232,I'm glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes.
45233,I wish you the very best with it all!
45234,"You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard, they don't always turn the way you might hope!"
45235,I don't know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.
45236,Dogs gonna do dog stuff. That's just how they do.
45237,That would be bad you should double check before you leave
45238,Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry
45239,Why were you ashamed? Did she disturb the neighbors or something?
45240,"I'm sorry that happened. You might need to get her obedience training,"
45241,Thats awesome! do yall have any plans? 
45242,lol maybe yall could find something to bond over
45243,Yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone
45244,Yeah we all do but we can only go forward
45245,Have you taken her to the vet?
45246,You might want to look up what is going on online
45247,That sucks. Next time they should tell you instead of laughing!
45248,I'm sure it's not so bad. At least you can laugh about it now!
45249,That is great! you should celebrate and enjoy this momment
45250,that is good! I hope you enjoy yourself
45251,Awesome! What's it about?
45252,Congrats! I hope it goes well. Are you presenting to a board of directors?
45253,Maybe you can save more and be able to get one.
45254,"Man that gets to me when someone does that , like they are better than everyone else."
45255,The holidays are a great time for that sort of thing. What did your family do together?
45256,I understand what you mean.  I hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each other's company soon.
45257,I hope you can have you applied or did you interview already?
45258,well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!
45259,I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully something better is coming along for you soon.
45260,Keep working hard and I think your efforts will eventually be noticed.
45261,"Ah that always sucks, did she need to go out or is she sick or something?"
45262,Well it isn't as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason.
45263,"Oh no, is it painful and disrupting you in anyway? "
45264,"Yeah, I know what you mean it does sound very scary, but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out, they fill in the cavity! "
45265,It has been raining a lot here too. Definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house.
45266,"That's good, sometimes it's good to just be lazy inside the house."
45267,so are you making him a gift?
45268,don't worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it
45269,"Do you have a general fear of flying, or is there something about this trip?"
45270,"Have you always had a fear of flying?  I haven't ever really feared it, but I don't like it."
45271,Was it another boring day today? 
45272,"Ohh okay I see, yeah I always get excited when new things happen at work too. "
45273,I know the feeling. Hang in there! tomorrow is always a new day 
45274,Did you hide the wrappers?
45275,"There's very few brands I feel that strongly about. What kind of yogurt is it, I might want to try it?"
45276,"I don't think I have ever seen that kind in the store, I'll have to look for it next time I go. I don't care much for the runny yogurt, but I like greek yogurt so long as it's whole fat and sweet."
45277,That is horrible. Americas government wont be of help....hopefully you have family?
45278,No cat or dog?
45279,Yes I love animals and have 3 dogs right now.
45280,I'm sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.
45281,"That sounds super scary, could he tell that your were scared or nervous? How did you escape that situation?"
45282,"Oh wow, it's fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. I'm glad you made it out of that awful situation. "
45283,That sounds a little scary. Why was he running towards your car?
45284,Did you give him any?
45285,"Aww, I am sorry, but I must say Pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good, did they help you feel any better?"
45286,"Ugh, that sounds wonderful, I would do the same if I were stressed I think"
45287,That's amazing. Were you impressed?
45288,That must take a lot of practice. I can't even juggle safe objects so I'd likely lose an arm if I tried to juggle chainsaws lol
45289,"Me, too!  I work at the registration department at a college and we're very busy until school starts."
45290,I think it's the feeling of the beginning of something new.
45291,Wow that is so sweet of her. She must really love you! 
45292,"Wow that is fantastic, she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person. :) "
45293,Good for you friend! I'm sure you'll find something soon. What field of work do you want to be in?
45294,That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also like something more stable. 
45295,"Oh no, they went on vacation without you?? "
45296,"Oh no that sucks, I am sorry that you had to stay home alone. What did you do to entertain yourself? "
45297,"Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. How are you holding up? "
45298,"Yes, I am sure that your cat is in a better place. If you ever want to talk to someone about it I am always here to listen. :) "
45299,"The big one? The bar? That's a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test! I imagine you're very excited, but anxious too."
45300,"Ahh. Still, another stone set on the road to payoff. I wish you the best!"
45301,You study hard?
45302,"Oh no, I bet you aced this one then."
45303,"Oh no, have you talked to him about it? "
45304,"Aww man, that sucks, I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off. "
45305,Oh I would be pissed. Hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate.
45306,Guessing he didn't get anymore food for dinner lol.
45307,"I'd imagine so. What a great time of our lives college can be. The world just seems right, being surrounded by your peers, all sharing similar goals. "
45308,"Mmhm. I wish I studied more, paid more attention, and joined more clubs. But I guess that's the thing, you're already as busy as it gets, and unfortunately you can't experience it all."
45309," That is great, confidence is always a key in success! I believe that you will pass as well! "
45310,"Yeah I bet! You will do great, I have high hopes in you! :) "
45311,"Aw, that stinks. Why couldn't they come?"
45312,"That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully, you'll be able to see them soon! I'm sure they were excited too."
45313,"Oh man, I bet you did. I would have had a gag reflex if I saw some one puking at the bar. "
45314,Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight 
45315,"Me too, it's so hard not knowing what to expect."
45316,"Right, no one truly knows until they get there, so scary."
45317,What was the book about?
45318,I'm glad you were happy reading the book.
45319,"Oh, I understand. I also remember mine. Do you remember something else about that day?"
45320,I imagine it was a big college. what did happen at the end?
45321,Me too! I love that game!
45322,I saw a machine one time that you could win live lobsters. They would cook it for you if you won.
45323,Nice! How long has it been since you last saw her?
45324,"Man, I hope you two do something fun!"
45325,All spiders or just the poisonous ones?
45326,"Thats fair I guess, weird fish freak me out more then spiders through"
45327,"Wow, is she an older or younger sibling? "
45328,"Aww man that sucks, One day your hard work will pay off, so don't let it get to you too much. I am sure she is not intentially doing that"
45329,"omg! I hate cockroaches, they are ugly insects "
45330,were you able to kill it? what did you do?
45331,"Well done. I hope you dont find anymore, they are scary. "
45332,Wow! that is really cool. Did he land the back flip?
45333,What prompted his back flip?
45334,It happens sometimes.  It only becomes a problem if you forget often.
45335,I hope they were pretty understanding.
45336,I hate burger king! McD's all the way
45337,Adding mac sauce to a cheeseburger is a game changer
45338,"That is unfortunate, did you fail the test?"
45339,You got this! I believe in you!
45340,Wow! Did you tell them anything?
45341,You should stop being their friend!
45342,"Oh, snitches are no fun."
45343,I would just keep to myself.
45344,"Well I think as long as you say sorry, she can forgive."
45345,I know how annoying that can be.  I love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times.
45346,Maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention.   Dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes.   Good Luck!
45347,I have done that before. It is not fun.
45348,I hope you threw out those pants.
45349,"Ooh, what kind of trick did she learn?"
45350,Aww! I wish I had a dog now!
45351,Okay. I'm not really a fan of it.
45352,"Yeah, that was a surprising result."
45353,Does it make you feel like you're living in an alternate reality?
45354,it can be scary at times. How do you deal with it?
45355,That is a good way. I have a dog that makes me feel safe. Do you have anything like that?
45356,You can watch some movies
45357,It depends on your preference. I watch korean dramas.
45358,Life is always a lot better when the sun is shining.
45359,When the sun is shining walking and seeing the beautiful sights makes me smile.
45360,That is good you have someone to share your happiness and problems with
45361,my best friend is my boyfriend. So I share everything with him
45362,Same here! where do you volunteer at?
45363,That is so generous of you! have you ever thought of joining a volunteer organization?
45364,what are those
45365,??? is it a cancer of some sort??
45366,"That is excellent! I wish I had the courage to do so, too. "
45367,I think it would be fun to help someone build a house.
45368,"oh yeah? was it because you didn't know if you could do the work, or because of all the hot college girls"
45369,well how did it go? did you do well?
45370,That must be nice. I wish i had one.
45371,"Yes, they do. And lots of care."
45372,What about it made you feel nervous?
45373,Yeah I understand. Big life changes make me feel uneasy sometimes too.
45374,"I lost my dog last year, I miss her too. "
45375,"I agree, they are the best. "
45376,That must feel good.
45377,Wow thats completely unfair!
45378,Well i mean sounds like favortism to me. Siblings always get the better things 
45379,"Wow, lucky you. I play those once in a year only"
45380,"I do not play too much because if I do not win, I feel it is a waste of money."
45381,well that's good. what's the subject?
45382,I hate chemistry because I think we should leave all that stuff to nature and just live our lives as the animals we are
45383,do you have a good teacher?
45384,Wow that is annoying. Did you get a spicy packet after?
45385,"That is okay, mistakes happen all the time."
45386,Did you drink a lot of coffee when you were a child?
45387,"I see, that is such a nice way to remember your past,."
45388,Well did you pass or did you fail?
45389,Well I guess you might want to study harder next time.
45390,oh you must love getting cancer results!
45391,"that's why I do it, for a great cardio workout. so what were the results?"
45392,and then what happened??
45393,and then what happened
45394,I hope something good was on
45395,yeah you are. what show was it?
45396,Really? what kind of icecream?
45397,That is a good one! it is not always broken though. Sometimes they are out of ice cream mix because the workers eat it all
45398,That is a rational fear when you are little. How did you overcome it?
45399,Oh that is a bad place to go
45400,Oh really? What were you guys talking about?
45401,Aww that's so sweet <3
45402,"He must be a good person bit if he's a stranger, is it safe?"
45403,That is good safety first
45404,I am sorry to hear that! what was its name?
45405,That is cute! is there a meaning behind that name?
45406,That is good! Never accept anything less!
45407,I'm rooting for you! Get your dream person!
45408,"I can imagine how it feel,more so if its someone who never leaves his/her phone down."
45409,The writing is very clear on the wall. You have been ignored.
45410,"Wow, that sounds intense! I hope you'll find out there was nothing to be stressed about after all!"
45411,Well I hope you won't have any of those mean teachers! Maybe you'll have some awesome ones?
45412,"that's sounds amazing, you"
45413,you didn't talk to any of them during summer break? is there anyone specific you're looking forward to see?
45414,I feel you. I am still scared even though I am sort of successful now!
45415,Uncertainty is the only certainty!
45416,Have you always felt that way or have changed your view over time?
45417,Well that is a good way of doing things as long are you getting the job right in my opinion.
45418,Yes I believe in you
45419,Your hard work will not fail you
45420,I'm so sorry. : ( 
45421,"Well, at least you came out without an injury? Or did you."
45422,Dang! What are going to do with all that free time!?
45423,Nice! Well I hope you have a nice and relaxing weekend!
45424,"Oh my god, that sounds like the most terrifying thing ever! Where was this so I know never to go there?"
45425,Not surprising. How long did it take you before you were able to eat a burger again?
45426,what kind of promises? who hurt you?
45427,what is the worst hurt you've ever seen?
45428,so I hear....
45429,Wow that sounds like good news!
45430,I'm glad to hear he has moved on with his life! A huge step forward.
45431,"Wait, you forgot you're vegetarian? That must've been pretty shocking"
45432,"Oooo you have to be sneaky with your meat habits, my friend"
45433,Who have you helped recently?
45434,That's really kind of you. Does the old man appreciate it?
45435,You are a good example to others.
45436,Sounds like a great friend! Do they just listen or offer helpful advice?
45437,Loyal and caring. You've got a winner on your hands!
45438,"good to know. and what makes you life so good, huh?"
45439,what if it all comes crashing down on you!
45440,Did your mother find out?
45441,How have you managed it? Have you thought about returning to the store and admitting to it?
45442,That sounds unfair. Maybe you'll get another chance to win.
45443,"Oh wow, well there is always another chance, we all learn on mistakes."
45444,I am not much of a gamer myself. What is your favourite game?
45445,You need to save your money to be able to afford it.
45446,I can sympathize with you. I've had a lot of betrayal in the past. The ONLY thing to do is to continue looking for trustworthy individuals. 
45447,"Not for naught but, a dog won't ever betray you <3"
45448,"oh my god, did it take a lot of work? and did it annoy you when it fell down?"
45449,maybe this time you can do it somewhere alone?
45450,Same. I hate my life. I sit in front of my computer all day
45451,Well I hope things turn out better for you
45452,why do you do it?
45453,oh I see. what do you want to do instead?
45454,That's unfortunate. Did you make up afterwards?
45455,That's good. You guys are siblings after all and should try to get along.
45456,"hi, what makes you think that?"
45457,"fair enough my friend, would you say your chances are high because of signs of other people winning around you recently?"
45458,"Could she just be too distraught to pick up a phone? I agree that she owes that much to you but, maybe shes too broken atm"
45459,"Hopefully you don't live too far. I know this is a random chat but, I genuinely hope your father is okay. I don't have a dad so, cherish every moment you get."
45460,"Golf is by far my favourite hobby, this sounds awesome! What island was it?"
45461,I will have a look at it on my lunch break today! I did snorkelling in the Philippines at it was amazing.  That was on the island of Coron
45462,Ooooof lmao do you work in an office?
45463,Thank goodness. You really dodged a bullet on that one
45464,oh boy oh boy oh boy where are you going??
45465,"well, I don't want to break it to you, but those guys are fictional...."
45466,Did the secret negatively affect others?
45467,"I can understand that feeling. Well, if it was pretty innocuous there's no harm and keeping confidentialiy"
45468,Oh wow more responsibility! I bet the pay raise will be welcome
45469,Sweet! Sounds like a good job. How are the bosses?
45470,thats a wonderful thing how long have you been married?
45471,very nice its always good to find a faithful and loving woman
45472,"we all make mistakes , what's important is to learn from them! and you were young so it's okay you know?"
45473,it's good that you learned from your mistake!
45474,That's awesome! Tell me about her.
45475,"Aw, that's great to hear about happy marriages! I hope you tell her often how much you appreciate her!  I'm sure you're a great husband too."
45476,Oh no! Did someone let it out?
45477,How old was he?
45478,"Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. It's stressful. I hope your job is safe?"
45479,"Totally. I can't imagine losing my job. Luckily the economy is pretty good, so maybe they will find new jobs quickly. "
45480,Why are you moving?
45481,I would feel emotional too with such a big transition in life. I am sure you will enjoy university though
45482,were they close to you? 
45483,that makes sense why you got upset but in the end we're all gonna follow them and you never now you may see them again
45484,That is so heartwarmingly sweet. I know exactly how you feel since my family means the world to me as well.
45485,It's true they grow up so fast. This is why we should appreciate every second we have with them.
45486,Oh wow- Do you have a college degree?
45487,Why do you find it hard to throw away old stuff
45488,So what are you planning to do
45489,"Oh no, I've had that happen before, it is the worst. I hope it wasn't too bad for you!"
45490,I understand that all too well! I'm glad it wasn't too bad though. I've had some pretty embarrassing things happen while hungover.
45491,did you apologise to him? maybe next time try to not drink a lot so you can control yourself?
45492,i'm glad it made you more aware of what you're doing.
45493,What are you going to do to change that?
45494,"Keep your head up high, good positive thinking."
45495,What did you do to it?
45496,"You are such a sweet soul. They say adopt and rescue ,don't buy"
45497,I wish I could have heard your speech. it must have been really funny.
45498,I hope he had a wonderful wedding. He must have been proud of you.
45499,Did you get the job? Or you're still waiting on the response?
45500,You must be really proud of yourself. That sounds really fulfilling!
45501,well if this isn't a great start for summer i don't know what is
45502,"of course you won't, have an amazing summer!"
45503,Oh it can really hurt
45504,Its fair that way
45505,"Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. You must be very worried about her!"
45506,"Oh gosh, all you can do is try to be there for her.  But yes, 14 is so young to be a mother. I'd be very upset too. I'm sorry."
45507,Must have really brought back good memories. I love nostalgia.
45508,It's a great thing these companies are doing letting you re-live the good old days when you're older!
45509,"Oh no, how embarassing! Did anyone see? "
45510,"I hate it when that happens! I hope you didn't hurt yourself, and that somebody tried to help? "
45511,How did it eventually go?
45512,Congratulations on a new job
45513,"Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. That really sucks, maybe you can reapply soon?"
45514,I can understand that. I think the next company you apply for will be your time to shine!
45515,Oh no! I confess I have done that to my kids!
45516,"Ha, that's good! Mine haven't gotten sick from it either. I just hate to waste food!"
45517,"Amazing, did you revise for it, or are you naturally clever? "
45518,That's cool - I never had the concentration to study that much 
45519,"Oh man, I would have moved out the next day."
45520,"I don't blame you. I've never seen one before, I'd hate to see one."
45521,Oh no. May I ask what you did wrong?
45522,Where did they take you? Back to your parents or to the police station?
45523,Did it work? Did you ever do it again?
45524,Well try to stay out of trouble now you are a bit older!
45525,were you happy for him? or did you get sad because you didn't want that to happen?
45526,"that's great, i'm glad she's nice to you."
45527,"That's wonderful news, congratulations! Are you going to celebrate?"
45528,I am so happy for you. You should get a nice dinner with your family.
45529,did he find out?
45530,thats good you told him. Thats a lot to keep inside. Hopefully he wasnt mad
45531,"Ohhhh, that is so bad. Why did you cheat?"
45532,"Oh no, sorry about that. But have you confessed to her"
45533,"well that's great news congratulations, how long have you known each other?"
45534,that's good that you put a lot of effort into it
45535,"haha, amazing! did you get shouted at?"
45536,That's really embarassing! did any of your friends poke fun at you for it? 
45537,What happened exactly? Is it just old and moldy?
45538,At least you got your moneys worth! Are you going to have it installed?
45539,That is so lovely
45540,Memories are good to be kept in the medulla. Good old days. You really had a good time
45541,"Aw. When you know, you know. How did you do it?"
45542,I bet it was really special though! Christmas is such a beautiful time of year. When are you getting married?
45543,That's too bad. Do you have proof of infidelity?
45544,It's good that you're faithful. Too bad your boyfriend couldn't be less flirtatious and respect you more.
45545,What kind of food does it serve? Sounds wonderful!
45546,Surf and turf! That's what they called a steak served with seafood. It's very yummy!
45547,"That's good, I love relaxing outside by a pool."
45548,That's always a good feeling.
45549,"oh man dogs are crazy! My dog killed a cat recently, I hope it's not poison!! Is he okay?"
45550,"oh no, you are a good dog owner though"
45551,Sounds like you are doing all the right things. Did anything go wrong?
45552,Oh that is great! Congratulations on your knew home! That must be so exciting!
45553,that's the coolest thing ever I didn't know you could have them as pets
45554,My kids would love something like that
45555,Monkeys!!!??? I have never heard monkeys howl.  Tell me more.
45556,"Where do you live that there are monkeys in the mountains?  I live in Florida, the flatlands. lol"
45557,"Sounds exciting.  But I would have been scared of howling monkeys too.  I am not sure why, but the term ""howling monkeys"" makes me giggle."
45558,Bye! Watch out for those monkeys!
45559,oh that is so exciting!!! good for you man!
45560,yeah pop that champagne!
45561,That sounds awesome! What's your favorite part of your vacation so far?
45562,What kinds of fruit do they have there?
45563,That's great that they let you work in exchange for lessons. I bet you have the best memories.
45564,That's awesome. Do you own a horse now?
45565,"That's awesome! Yeah I definitely find the more I study, the better I do. Funny how that works! "
45566,True. There has to be a work/school/life balance. 
45567,Well I hope he gets to felling better.
45568,You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.
45569,That's very considerate of you. I know some people that drink it all and don't replace it.
45570,"Lol it happens, what's important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge."
45571,"Awww, I never had one, but wanted one."
45572,What were your favorite games?
45573,"Wow, thats terrible. Did you get him to pay you all back?"
45574,"Well good riddance. If you never want to see scum again, just loan them $20."
45575,I'm sorry. It sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad. Could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?
45576,Well that's good news. I hope you do better on your next test.
45577,"Aw, I know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on."
45578,That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.
45579,Oh no! that's horrifying in high school! I hope you didn't get made fun of.
45580,Kids can be so mean. Thank God that's all behind us now!
45581,Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?
45582,I'm glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you.
45583,Absolutely. Great job!
45584,"I completely agree, having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits"
45585,"Yeah, and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!"
45586,Oh my goodness! That is scary! Are you alright? Did anyone get hurt?
45587,Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok. 
45588,"Oh no, poor dog :( I'd be devastated too, i love dogs so much."
45589,"Don't beat yourself up over it, it was a very tragic accident but who could've known. He's in a better place now."
45590,That was nice of her. Did everything work out?
45591,Oh no! Did you guys stillhave a nice evening?
45592,"Yeah I thought of that. well, the kids probably loved it!"
45593,Very nice.  How many shoes do you have?
45594,Are they all Yeezys?
45595,That sounds so nice!  Are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?
45596,"Yeah, that's not too bad at all!  Sounds idyllic!"
45597,Oh yes.  The first car is amazing
45598,Yes I remember the freedom that comes with the first car.
45599,I feel exactly the same way.  People should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others.
45600,"Yes, that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!"
45601,"I agree, it's something I struggle with as well. Have you tried an diets you liked?"
45602,"I've tried a few, and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on, and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive."
45603,"I see, I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight, to ensure that you don't feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel."
45604,That's awesome. I was always a daddy's boy growing up.
45605,Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.
45606,"I am sorry your dog passed away, I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?"
45607,I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)
45608,Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?
45609,Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.
45610,"Oh man, that is exciting! Do you know what kind?"
45611,"That's awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations, that's great news!"
45612,That's so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?
45613,"Aww, I'd love to see a video of that."
45614,You're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.
45615,Good thing you listened to your gut feeling
45616,Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.
45617,Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.
45618,Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?
45619,"Yeah, I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future."
45620,"Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself, animals like to play with each other!"
45621,That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.
45622,"That sounds great, I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?"
45623,"Wow, that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time."
45624,Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?
45625,"I bet he did, I'm glad he's okay though."
45626,Thats really nice you have a friend like that.That's hard to come by. I hope everything is better for you now.
45627,I'm sure he doesn't expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.
45628,I hope you arent and I'm not too! It would be rough living on the streets.
45629,It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing
45630,That sounds fun! Where did you go?
45631,"Mmmmm, I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!"
45632,I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.
45633,I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.
45634,What kinds of pets do you have?
45635,oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.
45636,Did he have superpowers?
45637,That's pretty impressive.
45638,"Oh wow, are you going to be in front of anyone important?"
45639,"Usually, you are the one who notices it the most. "
45640,"wow, that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too, i presume."
45641,"very cool, wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun"
45642,"Awww, I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly. "
45643,"Maybe also looking into getting a new dog, I know it's hard, but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well."
45644,That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!
45645,"Haha, that is true. But we have to make the most of this one. "
45646,Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married
45647,you dont still have any feelings at all for her?
45648,"Ooh, I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!"
45649,"Omg, that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself."
45650,Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. 
45651,Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.
45652,Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed! 
45653,"It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it."
45654,"Oh no, how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid. "
45655,"That is a tough spot to be in, maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral. "
45656,"That is good, such an embarrassing situation to be in."
45657,Oh man I want that too! did you get it?
45658,Do you use your computer?
45659,How much do they go for?
45660,thats not bad. I have a rx 280 
45661,"Moving, is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?"
45662,"That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time."
45663,"Oh man, I can't stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up. "
45664,That can make it so hard to sleep at night. 
45665,"Aw man, childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries. "
45666,"Haha, clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood! "
45667,Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?
45668,"If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it."
45669,Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.
45670,Agreed!
45671,"You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same, sadly. But so happy for you!"
45672,"I guess it all comes down to karma, if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :)"
45673,It's good to have a partner. 
45674,"I have a son, it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet."
45675,You must have been very happy when they returned home.
45676,Did you get it?
45677,That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you. 
45678,"That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully, you did not lose too much."
45679,"Yeah, but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line."
45680,"Hey, that's awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?"
45681,Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?
45682,You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?
45683,That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!
45684,"Oh, that's terrific! What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!"
45685,"Oh, I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!"
45686,"I also have two older puppies, training takes time and care and love."
45687,"Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well."
45688,i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.
45689,"i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games. "
45690,"Moving can be stressful for sure, hopefully you had some help?"
45691,It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization. 
45692,That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?
45693,I bet that worked!
45694,"Oh man, i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate."
45695,"I bet, hope the dog is feeling better though."
45696,"interesting, what was the issue?"
45697,"oh man, that is an issue, i hope he grows out of it"
45698,I bet you cant wait.  WHere are going for your vacation?
45699,Miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation.   I wish I was going with you!
45700,That sucks! What were they upset about?
45701,It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.
45702,That's exciting! When will she be moving in?
45703,Does she live far away?
45704,That sounds very frustrating.
45705,Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.
45706,"I've never tried VR, but just imagining that is scaring me away from it."
45707,Congrats!  How exciting for you.
45708,That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.
45709,It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.
45710,I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.
45711,What subject did you choose?
45712,Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.
45713,why was the officer yelling at her?
45714,"wow, that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady"
45715,That's so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.
45716,It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.
45717,"Sorry about that, you could have taken a taxi"
45718,good enough you got home safe
45719,Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.
45720,Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.
45721,"That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience, right?"
45722,No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.
45723,That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!
45724,"Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!"
45725,Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?
45726,"That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself, accidents happen."
45727,"Oh that's great, its awesome when the kids go off to school each year."
45728,"You'll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time, haha."
45729,"Wal-Mart is a place where weirdness always happens. Can you tell me what happened, I'm dying to know!"
45730,Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?
45731,That must have been a very windy day!
45732,I bet It will teach you.
45733,I go to church every Sunday I love it.
45734,The people you can meet are super.
45735,That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.
45736,So you don't like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do? 
45737,"Yes, usually when one relocates it's hard to make new friends, but eventually it will happen."
45738,That was really nice of your old friends.
45739,Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?
45740,Nice. What brand of shoes were they?
45741,That's terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?
45742,I'm glad he was able to catch him.
45743,"Wow, how was it? I have never seen that trailer. "
45744,"Aww, that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies! "
45745,Are they twins?!
45746,Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!
45747,"Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?"
45748,I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.
45749,I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? 
45750,"Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them. "
45751,That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?
45752,That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.
45753,"Oh, I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?"
45754,"Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun. "
45755,"That's great, but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!"
45756,"It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit."
45757,What a great feeling! You must love your dog.
45758,She sounds like a great companion.
45759,Are you looking forward to it?
45760,Exciting! I'm sure you'll do fine.
45761,"Wow, that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon."
45762,I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.
45763,That would keep me up at night.
45764,"Oh my gosh that's insane. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future. "
45765,I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. 
45766,"Aww, sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet."
45767,"Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup."
45768,"I do understand, I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying."
45769,That is awesome. I am proud of him 
45770,gotta risk it for the biscuit
45771, i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping
45772,"It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine, though! Have confidence!"
45773,"You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either."
45774,Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?
45775,"I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure, at least if you have a good boss, they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better."
45776,Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!
45777,"Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!"
45778,"Oh I know, mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun."
45779,It reminds you of how beautiful life is.
45780,"Wow, that's rude! He won't last long..."
45781,"Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!"
45782,Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?
45783,LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!
45784,You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.
45785,I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary
45786,I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.
45787,"Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it"
45788,The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. 
45789,That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?
45790,I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.
45791,"Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry, I know you must feel like crap."
45792,I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.
45793,Sweet! Where did you go?
45794,That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!
45795,I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?
45796,Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?
45797,oh no! hope all is well with your dog.
45798,Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. 
45799,BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?
45800,Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.
45801,"i completely agree. though, i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)"
45802,lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any. 
45803,That's terrible! What did you do?
45804,That's good. I'm glad your alright.
45805,Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset. 
45806,Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you
45807,Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it
45808,"OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass, or missing?"
45809,I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.
45810,Good job! How do you think you did on it?
45811,That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!
45812,Yeah I like going straight to the point too
45813,I like when I get places earlier than expected
45814,I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?
45815,That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!
45816,Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?
45817,"Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!"
45818,"That is wonderful! You must be happy, shows that he is getting bigger, soon it will be college "
45819,College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.
45820,That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind
45821,I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.
45822,"That must be hard to do, he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you."
45823,Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.
45824,That is so sweet. What is her name?
45825,"I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday."
45826,"That is very cute, the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long. "
45827,"That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days."
45828,That's good. How is it going?
45829,"That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it. "
45830,I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?
45831,I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.
45832,"lol, guess you were pretty hungry"
45833,"yeah, might wanna go replace it"
45834,That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?
45835,Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.
45836,i sure it was beautiful
45837,"really, i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment"
45838,"yuck, how gross!!"
45839,"lol right, they could easily be your neighbors dinner"
45840,"Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for your family."
45841,I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!
45842,why do you live so far from family
45843,i would like a new life. i totally understand
45844,what? that scary
45845,"wow, a hard lesson"
45846,I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.
45847,Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.
45848,That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?
45849,"What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat, but settling down is probably good too. "
45850,That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.
45851,yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies
45852,I am going on a trip to Peru to visit Machu Picchu! I can't sleep because of the anticipation!
45853,I hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history.
45854,"Yes, my friends are coming with me. :)"
45855,Congrats! Did you do it because of football season?
45856,Cool! Whats your favoirite? I like the office.
45857,I have never heard of Mr. Robot actually.
45858,Same here! I am glad you are doing well! :)
45859,I hope these feelings last for you!
45860,A puppy!  That's so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?
45861,"I don't know that I would be able to give it up.  4 is a lot, but what's one more?"
45862,"Well I'm sure he will be, most guys are. I'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me."
45863,"Everyone gets jealous, It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue."
45864,Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong
45865,Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.
45866,Wow!  How much did he win?
45867,That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.
45868,Good choice. You could have broken down and never made it to school.
45869,HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol
45870,Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.
45871,"I go to a psychiatrist and take meds, It just fixes what your body doesn't make, or do properly. It helps so much. "
45872,Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!
45873,Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.
45874,"I hope everything is fine, How did it turn out?"
45875,"Im happy to hear that, a sick child is always a scary thing."
45876,Neat. Where are you going?
45877,Sounds exciting. Have fun.
45878,"Oh wow, are you feeling super envious?"
45879,"Ha ha, I don't blame you! Hopefully you can get the car you want soon though."
45880,"I 'm glad to here it will be fine , but what was wrong with it?"
45881,I 'm glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.
45882,"Wow, that's so mean of them to laugh at you! At least someone pointed it out eventually, right? "
45883,"That's embarrasing. But hey, I think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! Don't beat yourself up for it. "
45884,Wonderful I bet she is really content if everything is perfect. Love to hear that someone is doing well.
45885,I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its own time
45886,The waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking.
45887,Things like that make me antsy.
45888,A new haircut can do wonders! I always feel like a million bucks after.
45889,I bet you looked great! Those compliments would've made me feel good too!
45890,Oh? What specifically were you talking to her about?
45891,"Haha! Well, as we mature, we learn so much more about ourselves."
45892,Haha you are a good father. I hope you can make it through it!
45893,Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.;)
45894,Oh no! So what did you do?!
45895,"That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath, right?"
45896,Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?
45897,Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.
45898,"Wow, cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?"
45899,"That's too bad. Well, at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself."
45900,That's amazing! How old is she?
45901,"Wow, that must've been a big thing for both of you."
45902,I am sorry I do not know what nclex is but I wish you good luck
45903,O ok I hope that everything works out for you 
45904,Wow! Did you try to get it out?
45905,That's amazing! He probably loves you so much
45906,Do you feel nice and refreshed though?
45907,"I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!"
45908,Oh no! Did it break?
45909,"Oh, that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one."
45910,Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?
45911,Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!
45912,"That is good, how long did it take before you go him to this point?"
45913,"Yeah i understand, it is good that you took him there though"
45914,Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?
45915,sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway. 
45916,Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment
45917,well maybe you guys should talk
45918,Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.
45919,Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now
45920,Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is. 
45921,Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol
45922,"I am with you, i like it a lot more than summer personally"
45923,"I feel that, I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold, but in the summer it is not that easy."
45924,I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.
45925,Did you pass the test?
45926,"I am the same way, I barely make anything compared to a lot of people I know"
45927,"I think cities are more expensive, like living costs, so I do not want to live there ether personally"
45928,I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.
45929,"Oh, I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?"
45930,That is amazing!  I'm really happy for you!
45931,It sounds like you really deserve it!
45932,"that does sound terrifying , are you feeling better ?"
45933,"at least your ok, thank god for that"
45934,"Nice, for what position"
45935,"That's pretty great, you must really take the initiative.  Good job"
45936,"You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning, and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people."
45937,"I think, maybe, yeah! It depends on who's there, and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of ""rescue me"" and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright. Other than that, I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4, max"
45938,"Aw, that's too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though."
45939,Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.
45940,"I am right there with you!  God is good and wow, He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way."
45941,"Yes, we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!"
45942,They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.
45943,Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!
45944,Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?
45945,I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!
45946,What is your nieces name?
45947,"That's amazing, was it your sisters first baby?"
45948,It will be amazing!  I should do that too!
45949,That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!
45950,That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.
45951,I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!
45952,"I imagine, are you prepared for it?"
45953,"Oh yes, last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days."
45954,"Aw, did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?"
45955,That's awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.
45956,I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.
45957,I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.
45958,That's good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?
45959,Good luck! You will do great!
45960,"Haha, I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed, but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens, since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up."
45961,"Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did."
45962,"That's gross, why are they coming in?"
45963,You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.
45964,"I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you, it is very sad."
45965,Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.
45966,I bet it wasn't Comcast! They wouldn't even give you a cup of water for free.
45967,I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!
45968,"Oh, wow! That is crazy, have you talked to the vet?"
45969,I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious. 
45970,Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!
45971,"That is a good lesson to learn early, I am glad everything turned out okay for you!"
45972,That sounds amazing!  But terrifying too lol
45973,I admire you!  I don't think you'll regret getting this experience
45974,Hahah that is funny. Were your parents angry?
45975,Haha did they believe it?
45976,"nice, what system do you play on?"
45977,i really enjoy video games as well
45978,That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?
45979,"You might try contacting the authorities, though I don't know if it would help. "
45980,thats awesome! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family
45981,did he enjoy the toys>
45982,Yeah that can be nerve racking! How did it go?
45983,That is good! Are you guys close now>
45984,Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?
45985,WOWZA! Congrats! Is it a job you can build a career out of.
45986,Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :)
45987,My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.
45988,Man.. i need some of that luck!
45989,Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that
45990,I agree! I wish I was able to make things
45991,For sure you are born with those types of talents!
45992,That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!
45993,I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day. 
45994,"that must have been embarrassing, I hope you weren't to traumatized"
45995,"that is good to hear, it was a motivation to succeed, a great character building "
45996,Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.
45997,You shouldn't think about death whilst you're alive! Just live each day to the fullest. 
45998,Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it. 
45999,That is a good test of friendship.  Did he keep his word?
46000,It is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend.  
46001,"Nice! I hope you get it, I'll cross my fingers for you also! Do you think you got a good chance?"
46002,"That's all you can do, but if you worked hard, I'm sure you will get it!"
46003,Oh cool. Were there any good picture in there?
46004,Well that's nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you. 
46005,Oh boy.  I've gotten quite a few of those before.  New hairstylist?
46006,That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back. 
46007,"Ohhhh, disgusting.  What did you do?"
46008,"I bet, what a terrible feeling!"
46009,"Oh man, your making it even worse.  I never even thought about that.  Now I want to throw up."
46010,is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself?
46011,yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too. the sooner the better
46012,"Oh my, I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you."
46013,Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!
46014,"Yeah, flying can be scary."
46015,Hopefully it isn't a long flight.
46016,thats awesome that you trust her
46017,its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays
46018,Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you driving?
46019,Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.
46020,That's the worst! Because now you'll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling. 
46021,"Yeah, I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things, but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them, I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch, because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow."
46022,"Oh man, thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets."
46023,"It's such a wonderful feeling, I should take a shower soon too."
46024,How did you you go over your budget?
46025,I hope you can have better self-control in the future.
46026,awww. that is good news!
46027,how long has it been seen youve seen each other?
46028,Oh gosg. Do you have some greedy roommates or something?
46029,Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.
46030,yea i have
46031,"thats great, happy for yo"
46032,literally me right now actually
46033,must be nice to have someone that loves you
46034,What is going on with your work?
46035,You can do better next time I believe in you!
46036,Ouch.  Why? 
46037,Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.
46038,"its not so bad, it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there"
46039,once you figure the way it just becomes routine
46040,"You are so right, did you read that somewhere?"
46041,"That is cool, have you studied any philosophy in school?"
46042,"Yes, I feel that every day."
46043,I wish people understood how precious life really is.
46044,Why did you throw your laptop?
46045,Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.
46046,"wow thats vivid, what game was this?"
46047,"ah yes league, love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more"
46048,"Oh no, I hope it wasn't an important meeting."
46049,"Sorry to hear that, were they understanding about it?"
46050,I'm sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?
46051,That sounds quite delicious if I must say.
46052,Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!  
46053,Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!
46054,"Yikes, that's a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees."
46055,Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I don't see society changing any time soon.
46056,Life is the most beautiful thing.
46057,I live every day like it's my last.
46058,Waiting in line is the worst.
46059,I hope you got your classes.
46060,Sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!
46061,"I agree that it is as well. In most situations, it can work to one's benefit."
46062,I don't understand what you are trying to tell me. Is this a joke?
46063,Why would they want to do that?
46064,I can imagine the flood of emotions.
46065,I hope it was worth visiting.
46066,Sounds like you are prepared. I like the confident attitude. Go get them!
46067,"I would love to come with you to yours. LOL, I just invited myself."
46068,I completely understand. Maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries.
46069,Are you looking for a new job?
46070,That's not true I'm sure. Do you have any friends to hang out with?
46071,I can understand. Maybe connect with some like-minded people online? 
46072,ewww that's gross!  Did you help clean it up?  And what was in that pizza anyway??
46073,He seems like a good friend.  
46074,The future certainly can be scary.
46075,I am curious for what the future holds.
46076,"Oh wow, the whole cake? Has she found out yet? Was she mad?"
46077,"If you can and have time, I'd try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe she'll understand."
46078,Oh cool.  How does it work?
46079,Oh that's easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.  
46080,"Oh man, I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn? "
46081,I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!
46082,That's good!  You're awesome!  Family is what is important
46083,I agree!  
46084,ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?
46085,"yeah defiantly, my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that's the one thing we seniors always wish we had done   "
46086,what? what happend? why are you angry?
46087,really? was it about something very stupid?
46088,"I think that's a kind of natural reaction, especially if it is just a hobby. I would have a fear of being judged."
46089,Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. It's more of a self-conscious thing.
46090,that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?
46091,that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to
46092,That's awesome! It's so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything.
46093,I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.
46094,what did he do yolo?
46095,this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!
46096,"Oh, yuck! That's gross. Did you get sick too?"
46097,that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.
46098,"don't be! i know this is overused but trust me, it's not as hard as everyone else makes it to be, if you focus and aim for your goals, you will get it! i know you can do it!"
46099,"don't be, i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out"
46100,"It really is, what can we do to help?"
46101,"That'd be a good idea, we could all start biking."
46102,What was the project?1
46103,You must be an expert on nutrition then!
46104,What are you looking forward too?
46105,"Which country? that sounds fun, are you guys doing anything fun there?"
46106,yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items
46107,yes. hopefully all will go well
46108,Are you his best man?
46109,"I hope he does, being the best man is an honour and you're ready for it."
46110,sounds quite interesting to code
46111,oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming
46112,I hope all goes well so you're as happy as possible.
46113,That's good! I hope you had a good time?
46114,"Yes, it's great when you run into an old friend you haven't saw for a long time. "
46115,What are you planning on doing with it?
46116,"That sounds so admirable, I'd love to see you grow to an amazing person."
46117,why don't you go get yourself some food? or just order some?
46118,oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture.
46119,"wow, spooky, what did you do next?"
46120,that must have startled you 
46121,You having money problems?
46122,I don't think I've ever had a delivery guy be that late. I'd be mad.
46123,"Oh, that stinks...literally! I have pets too so I know how you feel. My cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up!"
46124,"It is, I wished they could just use the toilet like we do!"
46125,thats good! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication
46126,that does have to feel really good
46127,"Yes, where do you live?"
46128,I love Colorado. I visit all the time.
46129,"Yeah, we have a lot to be thankful for.  We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident!"
46130,I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that.
46131,That is great. Where are you selling your popsicle?
46132,I understand. Good luck.
46133,You were probably just being you.
46134,Haha! That's usually the case. : )
46135,I understand. Is your family living far from New York?
46136,It is always cool to have family and friends close by.
46137,That is a great mindset to have!  You must feel very happy and content!
46138,Why do cities make you feel that way?
46139,Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas. 
46140,You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her! 
46141,Did you give it back or just walk away?
46142,"Yeah, that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself."
46143,I would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place. 
46144,Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - deff look into it! 
46145,I'm sorry to hear that...sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don't get overwhelmed.
46146,Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.
46147,"Maybe it isnt your body, but also your partners! Something to check into to see which end its coming from, but none the less it will happen! "
46148,"It's hard to trust anything, even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray. "
46149,"Thats kind of you, did everything go well when you put it back into the wild? "
46150,Sounds like it went well! 
46151,"Yes, I hate those kind of people. They have nothing to do expect lying about other people."
46152,"I just ignore them. At some point, they stop but they understand that it is not working."
46153,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better. 
46154,It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.
46155,"Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right, my god. Bring extras next time? lol "
46156,I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now. 
46157,"That's very sad, has he considered getting help for his addiction?"
46158,"I can certainly understand your feelings, I hope he can somehow fix his habits."
46159,Has it been a lot of fun?
46160,"Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood, such a great game."
46161,"I understand that feeling. It wouldn't make sense for us all to want to do the same things, especially if you've partied before already."
46162,That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.
46163,Oh that's great! Does it come with a nice raise?
46164,Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?
46165,I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!
46166,That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!
46167,Oh my...I hope you didn't hurt yourself.
46168,Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.
46169,"Yea, I feel the same way.  It's worse when you have to pass by them twice a day."
46170,Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.
46171,"Oooh, how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?"
46172,I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!
46173,Indoors?
46174,In the 6th grade? Where is this school?
46175,Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.
46176,How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.
46177,Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either
46178,haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play
46179,"Oh god, I am so sorry. Is he okay now?"
46180,I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.
46181,Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.
46182,Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.
46183,"You have to be more careful next time, maybe you need a calendar to remind you."
46184,"I am so sorry to hear, I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect."
46185,That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.
46186,Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.
46187,"That must have been a bit scary, You should have called the police."
46188,"You cannot be too careful these days, i am so sorry that happened to you."
46189,"Okay! Now that is interested, I would love to see them."
46190,Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.
46191,"Free? That makes it even better, I will be getting me some posters."
46192,I hope so too. Thank you so much!
46193,I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?
46194,I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.
46195,Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?
46196,That sounds like it was a lot of fun!
46197,Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/
46198,Yeah i would get a pet
46199,"That is so sweet of you. I love cats, you must be a caring spouse."
46200,"The cat didn't like you, oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat."
46201,I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it
46202,Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle
46203,Its a good guard dog then
46204,What kind of dog is he
46205,Animal accidents can be really bad!
46206,"At least no one else was injured, but it is sad about the cow. "
46207,Just cherish the moments
46208,It will be okay
46209,That is a nice job I am sure
46210,Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?
46211,That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.
46212,"Awesome, congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift, is there a particular game you're eager to play?"
46213,Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!
46214,Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?
46215,I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?
46216,I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!
46217,What kind of con was it
46218,that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that
46219,That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?
46220,Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.
46221,Why did you do tht?
46222,"That makes sense, you are a good older sibling!"
46223,"I would imagine, that is a lot to drink!"
46224,"I get that, well I hope you feel betternow!"
46225,"I get that, did your friends know how to ride bikes?"
46226,Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot
46227,Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?
46228,Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol
46229,"Oh, I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel... "
46230,Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.
46231,"Oh no,  what happened?"
46232,"That is terrible, you must have been devastated,  I hope he find the help he/she needs."
46233,"Oh dear, but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying."
46234,He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.
46235,"Haha no way, I thought that only happens in cartoons!"
46236,"I'm sorry but I probably would have, too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!"
46237,"That is unfortunate, is he doing any chemotherapy ?"
46238,Well I hope everything works out for him!
46239,What were you waiting for!
46240,Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!
46241,How well did it work out for you?
46242,Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!
46243,o no what did you do?
46244,o no im not sure that was the best response
46245,Oh No! Did you get hurt?
46246,I bet that was a little embarrassing. 
46247,Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it
46248,That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!
46249,That is great to hear that things are going well for you.
46250,I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.
46251,How long has it been since the interview?
46252,Oh well congrats and good job!
46253,Oh that is awesome for your friend!
46254,Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.
46255,"That was probably not a good idea, how did it go for you?"
46256,"Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well."
46257,That can be kind of scary. How did it go?
46258,"Awesome, congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared."
46259,Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up
46260,"For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it, most people dont'"
46261,Aww haha how many bags did you bring
46262,Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one
46263,Have you tried talking to them about it?
46264,"I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy, I didn't know that they still exist either!"
46265,I loved that too!
46266,"That is wonderful to hear, good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy."
46267,Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.
46268,"Aw, that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. "
46269,Did you share it with anyone else?
46270,"Nice, a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?"
46271,Well I hope you get it. Good luck!
46272,That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?
46273,I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.
46274,I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery
46275,Ha YOLOOO
46276,"I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season, too?"
46277,"I don't mind winter either but you're so right, the temperature is just right during fall."
46278,"Awe, sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think."
46279,That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!
46280,I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?
46281,"I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh, how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah, you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it."
46282,That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?
46283,I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.
46284,"I certainly hope so,  Why do you want to move?"
46285,"That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too."
46286,"Hmm, don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?"
46287,"Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!"
46288,Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?
46289,Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!
46290,Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun 
46291,Yup gotta lay down the law
46292,Terrifying! What was it?
46293,Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?
46294,Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?
46295,That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.
46296,that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?
46297,Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!
46298,How come you can't take them anymore?
46299,"Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!"
46300,That's intense. I hope you did well!
46301,Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved
46302,I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!
46303,"Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them"
46304,Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.
46305,That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.
46306,That is great! Hopefully he continues to be
46307,Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even
46308,Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?
46309,I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.
46310,That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?
46311,Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. 
46312,Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!
46313,"To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!"
46314,Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?
46315,Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.
46316,What was her reaction to that
46317,That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time
46318,Have you ever passed out together watching tv?
46319,How old is your baby?
46320,And how long have you been married?
46321,that is exciting! will it be your first house?
46322,that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one
46323,You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?
46324,Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?
46325,"Don't worry, from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least."
46326,Lol that makes a lot of sense?
46327,well that sounds fun!
46328,Haha caught red handed!
46329,"Yeah, I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service"
46330,Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.
46331,Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!
46332,Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?
46333,That is a good news. I hope he get it.
46334,Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young
46335,"I understand, when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still"
46336,Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day
46337,Were at work today or doing something else?
46338,"Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting, or wish she were more responsible with her money?"
46339,"Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse."
46340,Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!
46341,"Yeah, thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me."
46342,Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened? 
46343,Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that. 
46344,Sounds like your co workers respect you then
46345,Or that as well ha
46346,Did you ever get caught?
46347,Was she disappointed?
46348,How many month earlier he came?
46349,Is he healthy?
46350,whatwas the exam for?
46351,tha is really cool what was your grade
46352,What are they arguing about?
46353,That's so ridiculous!
46354,"If everyone thinks you're worthless, then maybe you need to find new people to hang out with "
46355,"Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this "
46356,First thing I'd suggest is getting the sleep you need or it will impact how you think and feel 
46357,Therapy is essential for those that are feeling depressed and worthless 
46358,I first want to let you know that you are not alone in your feelings and there is always someone there to help 
46359,"Heck, sure thing, hun!Feelings of 'depression' have a deeply-rooted base in physical structures that may not be functioning very well at present; and, we can certainly turn them on again using means that you are able to find around the house and with relative ease :)After that, emotional and spiritual support will be liberally applied "
46360,You are exhibiting some specific traits of a particular temperament type 
46361,That is intense 
46362,It sounds like you may be putting yourself last 
46363,It must be really difficult to experience what your going through right now 
46364,"People who feel worthless were, in one way or another, were told that they are worthless "
46365,I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this intense emotion of worthlessness 
46366,It sounds like you may be struggling with depression 
46367,I'm glad you are interested in changing your feelings of worthlessness 
46368,"You have
several things going on here "
46369,"Hello, you sound like you have so much on your mind! I am relieved to hear that you have never tried or have contemplated suicide, but not being able to sleep, feeling worthless, and like you shouldn't be here are big issues that need addressing "
46370,It sounds like you are having some pretty severe depression 
46371,"You can, for sure "
46372,Oftentimes we can change our feelings about ourselves by building a better relationship with ourself 
46373,Feelings of worthlessness often originate from what you learned about yourself when you were young 
46374,The feeling of being worthless is caused by your inside being not matching your outside result 
46375,"Hi there, I'm sorry you're feeling this way "
46376,I am sorry you are feeling this way

46506,Despite your anxiety you are highly attuned to your sense of well being and skillful in articulating the details of when anxiety takes over 
46507,"First of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! You are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time "

46512,It is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continue 
46513,Hi! I'm Amelia 
46514,Maybe the problem is learning to trust yourself to not be afraid other people!Reflect on what you believe would increase your trust of believing your own judgement on whom to trust 
46515,"There's a lot of layers there to your situation, and I'm focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others "
46516,"It might be helpful to have a good understanding of the ""why"" in terms of feeling nervous around people, or the difficulty in developing more comfort "
46517,"I'd wonder first if you were still in the same home and neighborhood where you raised your son and experienced the abuse? In many ways, we react to our environments - and if you're still surrounded by neighbors who didn't reach out when they heard your ex yelling or offer assistance and resources when your son acted differently than his peers, it might make sense that you're more timid around folks "
46518,I would look at getting engaged with a support network of individuals who may also have autistic children 
46519,"These types of symptoms can be very disruptive to life! Anxiety often presents in two key ways: 1) physical symptoms such as: racing heart rate, sweaty palms, dry mouth, shaking or trembling or nausea - often these physical sypmtoms are categorized as a Panic Attack "

46521,Why not accept and tolerate that you naturally are a shy person who doesn't like large groups?This is not necessarily something to get over if it is part of who you are 
46522,Would you worry less if you and your partner had a plan as to when you will be together as a couple?Long distance relationships are not for everybody 
46523,Maybe you are afraid to let go of your problems for a few hours 
46524,One approach is to be more accepting of yourself as someone who has fears 
46525,Your question is a good one!The best way to decrease the fear would be to talk with your fiancee about it 
46526,The short answer I could give is that we don't know why it's happening 
46527,Maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware exists 
46528,One way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourself 
46529,"Does it help to put a name to the experience you are having? Where you first said, ""I've been upset for no reason and feeling anxious,"" you then say that you are ""feeling burnt out,"" which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like ""no reason "
46530,"There's no such possibility that you're upset for ""no reason""!The reason is not obvious, not that you are feeling upset in response to nothing at all "
46531,"The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the anxiety "

46534,you can learn lots of skills/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention 
46535,"Since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result, or fear of being judged negatively, as though having failed some sort of test, consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audience?Maybe, for example, if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would, you'd feel more secure in speaking in front of an audience "
46536,This is a very common question in my practice 
46537,The are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with 
46538,"Basically, your response is the fight, flight or freeze reaction
which is hard wired into the human nervous system, specifically, theautonomic nervous system (called the autonomic response) "
46539,Interesting: How much of your issue is your own self-judging and how much of your perception is real?There are many ways to stop judging and self-judging using Cognitive Theory (CBT) 
46540,"I think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is, ""what's the rush?"" Just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that there's something wrong or something to be ashamed of "
46541,A good first step would be to make an appointment with your primary care provider & discuss your concerns 
46542,I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks 
46543,Oh dear - this is becoming all too common 
46544,"Sometimes stress helps us become motivated and thrive to do better however, if your daughter is stressing to the point that she is crying and freaking out then that would be concerning "
46545,"The most important action you can take here is validating her feelings and staying calm when she is crying and ""freaking out"" "
46546,I hear your concern that your daughter might break under the pressure and stress that she is dealing with 
46547,"Aye, you're correct, that isn't normal, and maybe you should get her to a doctor!Before you do that, and if she were my daughter, I would provide her the necessary physical support that can be given readily at home; that is: proper natural diet, rest, and a good sense of detoxification before she readies herself to approach it "
46548,Your daughter is suffering from extremes of perfectionism 
46549,"As parents, it's hard not to have ""freak out"" moments when our children are being bullied, stressed, or exhibit other symptoms of teenage angst "
46550,I am sorry to hear about your daughter 
46551,Hi there Mom! Just look at all of the things that a teen has to juggle and it's no surprise they're stress out 
46552,I understand that as a mom it must be really hard to see your daughter stressing about things at school 
46553,I hear that you are concerned about your daughter's reaction and her emotional well being 
46554,It sounds to me like your daughter is anxious to be perfect and has a low tolerance for failure 
46555,children and adolescents who have a desire to achieve high grade point averages often have the symptoms you are describing 
46556,"Dear Concern Mom, Sadly, kids nowadays stress a lot about school and compete with one and another "
46557,Thank you for being an observant parent and taking the very important step toward getting help for you as well as your daughter 
46558,"Hello! First of all, thank you for paying attention to your daughter and noticing that she is concerned! It sounds like you have been a positive influence on her for her to be so focused on achievement and for her to care so deeply about her performance! Based on what you've said here, I understand that you are concerned that she is overly stressed, though "
46559,As a therapist and mother of four children (3 of whom are teenagers) 
46560,As a Parent it can be very hard to see your child struggling 
46561,It sounds as though your daughter is struggling to manage her anxiety and she is having really big reactions to what you view as small problems or issues 
46562,It may be helpful to register for a class you can take together 
46563,"Its hard to answer this question based on the information presented but I shall give it a go, Is it possible that your daughter is afraid of failing, I've seen many children and kids who get stressed out over grades or performance in sports, can you tell me ""what was your grade in fourth grade English? Or what was the score of the 7th game you played in football when you were a junior? Much of what happens to us is insignificant and we worry over things which really , in the long term don't matter much to us "
46564,"I imagine you are trying to figure out a way to be ""fair"" to your adult kids "
46565,All you can do/control is work on yourself 
46566,"Hello, I am sorry to hear about you feeling verbally abused, trapped without an escape, and emotionally drained "
46567,I am so sorry this is happening to you 
46568,"Your situation is a difficult one, but I would encourage you to start considering how to set boundaries for yourself and your family members "
46569,I am so sorry you are experiencing this situation 
46570,The first step is realizing your value and establishing firm boundaries 
46571,I can't imagine what you are feeling but I can tell you that you are right to be concerned about your children baring witness to this abuse 
46572,"I think one of the best things to pass on to our children, or simply one of the best lessons in life, is to learn when to internalize (it's an issue in me) and when to externalize (it's an issue in them), as well as always finding the balance of the two "
46573,"When their verbal abuse starts, tell them you are exiting the conversation because the way they're talking to you is unacceptable "
46574,"This sounds frightening and overwhelming, and I’m glad you are reaching out for help "
46575,"It sounds like your children are walking on eggshells, and behaving in a manner that suggests that (at minimum) they may be receiving an undue amount of anger from someone in their lives "
46576,"The short answer to your question is ""No"" it's not okay for anyone to ever be doing this "
46577,"The kids are actually her Property, and he does have a claim to them as he wishes;The house is yours, I presume;So require that if he wishes to see his Property, it be done off of your Property;And, that as long as it remains your Property, you have jurisdiction over all those, therein;Require compensation for visits, and send him a bill;When he doesn't pay, send to the local sheriff, go to small claims court, and win a judgment against him for non-payment;I wonder how that might work out "
46578,"The obvious answer is no, it's not okay "
46579,"Do you know the reason your fiancé puts up with the ex's behavior?If not, then ask her "
46580,"Depending on your daughter’s age, this could be a learning disability "
46581,"At times when a child is not displaying milestone behavior at the same rate that is average for their peers, this should raise concern, so you are correct in reaching out for advice "
46582,Kids develop in different ways and different speeds 
46583,Contact your daughter’s school and ask for an occupational therapy evaluation 
46584,"Developmentally, there are ages where not coloring in the lines, writing words that are jumbled together, and leaving big spaces or skipping lines are completely normal "
46585,It sounds like it might be worth asking the school for an evaluation to determine whether your daughter has any learning disabilities such as dysgraphia or dyslexia or seek an evaluation through an educational neuropsychologist 
46586,"This is certainly an important issue tolook into, It is always helpful to speak with the child's pediatrician since they are most familiar with the child'sdevelopmental history "
46587,"Your daughter is fortunate to have an observant parent, who is willing to seek out help in this regard "
46588,"Your child is not part of your past, he or she is part of your present and future "
46589,"Hi, your situation sounds very complicated and sensitive "
46590,What are the ways your ex-wife uses your child as a pawn?This answer determines the best ways to handle particular situations 
46591,"Behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training, both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family members "
46592,Probably the best way to be supportive of your son is to tell him what bothers you about the way he's handling himself 
46593,"You felt bad when you lied, so you told the truth "
46594,Hey! Sounds like the part of you that knows the RIGHT thing to do won here! I am so proud of you for admitting that you lied to your Mom! Sometimes lies come out of our mouths before we can even catch them because we are trying to say what the other person wants to hear 
46595,"That sounds awful, and is clearly unsustainable "
46596,"Hello,I know that your situation is frustrating and debilitating "
46597,"A lot depends on the age of your child, but given that it was a mis-used debit card, I am going to guess he's a teen? Assuming that, there are a couple of important things to keep in mind "
46598,It is great that you are noticing these changes with your daughter 
46599,This is a common response parents can have 
46600,You seem to have been a very positive influence in your kids' lives 
46601,This is something you will have to discuss with your husband 
46602,"Oh my goodness, my heart goes out to you!! I pray you have other strong and supportive loved ones or friends surrounding you "
46603,Your nephew's behavior sounds normal and developmentally appropriate 
46604,"There's two things this post relays - one, which I'm sure you've already looked into - is working with the school to address this problem "
46605,Financial stability is probably a good place to start your new life project 
46606,You wrote a very full family context w many directions to examine 
46607,"Parents are to teach discipline tochildren, not punishment "
46608,Absolutely not!It is never in a child's best interest to use humiliation as punishment 
46609,Hi!  I'm sorry you are having such a tough time with this situation 
46610,That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now 
46611,If the daughters are old & mature enough to understand substance abuse 
46612,The information from the other therapists here is sound and prudent 
46613,"I see a few issues here:First, the age of the child is important "

47000,You know have the right therapist if:Your counselor specializes in what you are seeking help for or they have experience with treating people with similar issues 
47001,"When you have the right therapist you just know, as evidence of the help that you have received, the progress that you have made, from the rapport and partnership that you have gained with your therapist, and from if you feel supported in a way that is helpful to you, as well as if your therapist has a good understanding of what your needs are and what you desire to gain from your therapy experience "

47008,You should like and trust your counselor 
47009,"I think it's crucial that a person finds the ""right"" therapist "

47011,You can certainly ask the therapist questions such as their style or issues they have experience working with 
47012,"Though this varies from person to person, I think finding the right therapist involves finding someone who you're comfortable opening up to and speaking your mind, including your preferred areas of focus for treatment "
47013,"How do you know anything is ""right"" for you? I think it's an intuitive process, and not always based on the objective expertise of the therapist, either (most psychotherapy research has concluded that the client-therapist relationship is the strongest factor in success in therapy "

Great TherapistA colleague and I were discussing the characteristics of
successful therapists "

47024,The most important thing is it has to feel right 
47025,What an important question! I think one of the first things to assess is this: Do you feel comfortable with your therapist? Do you feel like you can talk openly about what's going on in your life without feeling judged? Do you experience your therapy as a safe space to process your thoughts and feelings? Feeling comfortable with your therapist is a crucial factor 
47026,"I believe that the right counsellor will help you feel empowered, supported and understood "
47027,"Such a good question! Sometimes, clients will feel like they are not connecting with their therapist and will put it on themselves "
47028,Good question!The client's job is to concentrate on stating the details of their problem and to thoughtfully engage in a dialogue about these areas with the therapist 
47029,Thinking whether or not you have the right therapist can be overwhelming if you are not sure what you want or need 
47030,"The ""right"" therapist is a combination of expertise in the areas where you require, and fit as far as how comfortable you feel in speaking and sharing with that person "
47031,You have the right therapist if you feel safe with that person 
47032,"This is a really important question, because you don't want to waste your time and money with a therapist who is not a good fit for you "
47033,"It's more than just normal, it's expected! Quite honestly, there are a very few days where at least one client hasn't cried during therapy throughout the day "
47034,Yes it is absolutely normal! A good therapist can help your feel safe enough to really identify painful wounds 
47035,Absolutely it's normal to cry in therapy sessions 
47036,"Crying in therapy is a natural response, a relief to what you are going through "
47037,Although not everyone cries in therapy

47051,"Yes, it's totally normal! Crying is a part of processing the tough stuff, no matter your age, gender or background and the therapeutic session is a safe space to do this "
47052,Crying during a therapy session is not unusual 
47053,"Yes, it is very normal "
47054,"Yes, many people cry during therapy! Crying can offer a type of release as your body reacts to the input of your autonomic nervous system "

47067,"Therapy is by nature a safe place to discuss difficult, or painful memories or experiences and thereby it is normal that feelings of all kinds, including sadness, loss, frustration, disappointment, etc may arise "
47068,This is a great question! I often wonder about what normal really means 
47069,"Yes, it is normal to cry during therapy, it is a time of catharsis, letting things out, shedding our skin, dropping our weights and just to let you know, even therapists sometimes feel like crying in sessions "
47070,It is very routine to feel all of the different emotions in therapy 
47071,"1) An awareness of their own incompetence and inexperience with events in your life;2) An awareness of how the body, mind, emotions, spirit, and others all intertwine and activate one another;3) How to work to use these connections to have you improve your experience "
47072,"Here is a list of skills I use every session, and a short explanation of what they are:Reflecting: Paraphrasing what clients have said so that they know you understand themValidating: Helping clients to know that their point of view is valuable and rationalClient-centered talk: Maintaining focus on the client in therapy sessions, rather than a therapist talking about themselvesAttending: Nonverbal or verbal cues that indicate I am listening to a client (i "
47073,"I think that the most important skill a good counselor has is the ability to empathize (whether that be natural empathy, or trained, empathy is essential "
47074,"Dang right! :)Heh heh, and correct me if I'm wrong "
47075,"Yes, just like some relationships outside of our work are more difficult than others "
47076,Hi! Great question 
47077,Counseling definitely helps people! I have seen so many positive changes from those willing to engage in the counseling process 
47078,"No, not really;And it's impossible for it to, anyway;And, this is isn't some sort of ""you did it all yourself"" kind of blather;Because:1) In most outcomes, if a man or woman simply does nothing and waits, most of the time, they get better "
47079,"You are asking a room full of counselors, and so I am going to guess that we may be a bit biased :) "
47080,"Counseling is a collaborative process which involves the development of a confidential, unique, therapeutic, helping relationship "
47081,"Experts have defined counseling as a healing relationship that helps patients by providing a space to vent, process and receive unconditional support "
47082,"I believe that counseling (and finding a GOOD therapist)
will be of significant help when the individual seeking therapy desires change,
improvement, and overall growth "
47083,"A lot of things affect how helpful counseling is for each person, including at least these things, but often many others:The therapeutic alliance (this refers to the bond, connection, or trust between the client and the counselor)What the person is coming in to work onHow motivated the person is to work on what it is they would like to changeSome people also ask how counseling is different from friendship "
47084,"Hello,There are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process, however they all start with picking up the phone "
47085,"Honestly, don't :(Talk with your close friends, first (y'know, the ones you actually can tell sh*t to, not the more surface level ones, god-bless-their-souls "

47092,There are probably no two therapists alike because first and foremost we are human beings!And 
47093,What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &#34;triangulation&#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Hello, and thank you for reaching out to ask for help "
47213,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be similar to anxiety disorders, assuming that you have already been diagnosed with OCD, it is important that you learn to identify the symptoms, the triggers and how to manage them "

47221,"If you feel this real for you, then it is "
47222,Maybe 
47223,You may have some options for low-cost or free counseling 
47224,"&nbsp;A lot of times when you're experiencing nightmares and flashbacks, it can be a sign that you haven't fully processed what happened "
47225,&nbsp;This sounds very hurtful for you to be on the receiving end of this 
47226,&nbsp;Sexual intimacy can be very triggering for survivors even when it is both wanted and consensual 
47227,My initial response: &nbsp;consider a more comprehensive MH assessment to determine other factors 
47228,"&nbsp;It can absolutely be normal for men to fantasize about sexual activities with other men! Fantasy can be an incredibly fulfilling experience for you and your partner! This could be a aspect of your sexuality that you would benefit from exploring thorough conversation with trusted someone, like your spouse or close friend (or therapist) "
47229,"Could you tell her ? &nbsp;What would happen if you said ""Mom, I love you and I really want to share myself with you, but often I you get upset and I don't want that to happen "

47232,"<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size:12 "
47233,you can learn lots of skills/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And&nbsp; you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention 
47234,"My first reaction to this is that It sounds like you rely alot on the impressions and projections of the outside world, that you need validation from other people to compensate for a lack of something on the inside, build yourself up on the inside, work on yourself, use positive affirmations daily, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">it would be wise for you to research some self-construct theory and do some self-concept work "
47235,"Since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result, or fear of being judged negatively, as though having failed some sort of test, consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audience?<span style=""-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">Maybe, for example, if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would, you'd feel more secure in speaking &nbsp;in front of an audience "
47236,"This can be tough to do in this money-driven crazy world where many therapists are not taking cases pro-bono anymore and quite often charge exorbitant prices for sessions, however I would ask potential therapists if they do take any cases on pro-bono, I usually reserve some hours for people who simply have no finances but need help, there are still some that do, if your ex-military you can look at ""Give and Hour"" which is an hour a week for ex-service members, often times you can look to your local pastor, minister or priest (there are still some good ones out there) to help with finding or providing help to you, there are free hotlines you can call that are staffed by knowledgeable people that cost nothing, lastly you may look into getting state insurance which would enable someone to take you on "
47237,"Depending on the source of your traumatic experience, there may be ways to get free treatment to help you "
47238,"There are many possible issues to consider as depression &nbsp;social anxieties, even medical illness "
47239,"Best answer that I can give to you is that some level of de-personalization is quite normal for everyone, it will come and go throughout life, kind of like being on a roller-coaster, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">""here it is, then it's gone not to return for quite some time"", </span>like many things, the more that you fixate on it, the more stress it will cause you, consider it part of life, accept it, and move on, now if your having many, many ,many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at, but for the most part nothing to worry about "
47240,"One thing I would ask is ""why are you still hanging with those {<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">friends}</span>?"" A relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties, it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people "
47241,"Its hard to answer this question based on the information presented but I shall give it a go, Is it possible that your daughter is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">afraid of failing</span>, I've seen many children and kids who get stressed out over grades or performance in sports, can you tell me ""what was <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">your </span>grade in fourth grade English? Or what was the score of the 7th game <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">you </span>played in football when you were a junior? Much of what happens to us is insignificant and we worry over things which really , in the long term don't matter much to us "
47242,Has any of your family members told you their reasons for their opinion?Find this out first 
47243,"It is challenging to maintain motivation at all times, anxiety and depression can set in which can make interacting with others a &nbsp;struggle, it can lead us to do things that make us not feel good and we become isolated "
47244,"Without knowing the male family member's reason for always wanting to play with your toddler, yes, it is strange "
47245,What happens in your life on Wednesdays that you feel like crying? &nbsp; Crying is natural 
47246,Yes! You can move on from a relationship that ends abruptly with no explanation 
47247,I am so sorry you are struggling! &nbsp;I do think it's a good idea to share your feelings with your parents and perhaps get some help connecting with a counselor or therapist if you feel that might help 
47248,Hi! I am so glad you're reaching out! &nbsp;Sounds like you have some solid support in some areas of your life but are still dealing with some difficult dysphoria

47254,"If you are saying that he will not have sex with you, but the rest of your relationship is as you would like it to be, perhaps you can have a discussion about it "
47255,Mood swings can be related to many different things 
47256,"I'm not really sure what ""not good enough"" means "
47257,Transgender means that you feel as though the gender that you are is different than the gender that were born with 
47258,"<p style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8 "
47259,"&nbsp; It is not a stupid question, it is very basic "
47260,"&nbsp; As you seemed to have learned, the impact will not just ""go away"" "
47261,"&nbsp; A good start is to pay attention to some basic issues: sleep, nutrition, exercise and socially supportive relationships "
47262,"<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Do you want to be upset about a girl that he forgot about?&nbsp; Think about it for a minute "
47263,I know that most people who are transitioning from one gender to another are required to enter into counseling at some point 
47264,"Seeking professional help does not mean that you will necessarily be admitted into an inpatient setting - though &nbsp;to be honest, that can become an option if you feel unsafe or if you are unable to plan for safety "

47266,"Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked? &nbsp; If this is possible, interview a therapist before &nbsp;starting therapy "
47267,"These types of symptoms can be very disruptive to life! &nbsp;Anxiety often presents in two key ways: &nbsp;1) physical symptoms such as: racing heart rate, sweaty palms, dry mouth, shaking or trembling or nausea - often these physical sypmtoms are categorized as a Panic Attack "
47268,"Have you brought up the topic as to the way you're feeling?The best way for someone to understand us or to understand someone, is to directly talk about &nbsp;the specific problem "
47269,I don't know if you have any details regarding what makes him say he is not ready for marriage 
47270,I'm not sure whether you're asking for help to cope with the relationship between you or feelings that you are having 
47271,&nbsp; &nbsp;Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband 
47272,"&nbsp; &nbsp;The comments here from the other therapists are ""spot on"" "
47273,&nbsp; &nbsp;It took a lot of courage to share what must be so shameful to you and to ask for help 
47274,&nbsp; &nbsp;The information from the other therapists here is sound and prudent 
47275,This would be very unsettling for most people 
47276,Saying that this is a very emotional time for you would be quite the understatement 
47277,"Basically, being an alcoholic means that someone really depends upon alcohol and does not function well or becomes sick if they do not have it "
47278,"First, I'm very sorry that this has happened "
47279,"I don't have experience with this type of tic, but I can still give you a few general thoughts "
47280,&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for asking your question 
47281,&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for sharing as it shows your humanity and that you have a sensitive conscience 
47282,"One thing you could try is to talk to your partner when she's not angry about the following:<ul><li>If she's angry, maybe she can talk with you about what she is angry about rather than calling you names "
47283,"<span style=""line-height: 20px;"">To be honest, I think more information would be really important here because what you are asking could have a lot of different meanings "

47285,Social anxiety is fear of social situations where someone is exposed to the public scrutiny of others

47298,"What you call ""little things"" may only seem little in general and to you are quite meaningful, either in fact or because the little things represent much more serious matters in your life "
